dating,147yltg,2023-06-12 21:46:12,Girl (25) Ive(29) been dating says she cant be sexual with me because she feels like shes cheating,"She has been in an open relationship for 6 years and as far as I know, he knows who I am. She does hide our interactions though like he does not know everything we do as she doesnt report it. For example if I go pick her up or if she comes over herself she won't tell him. We went to a flower market yesterday and I got her tons of peonies for her and her mother. It seems that she told her bf that she bought them. I noticed she wouldnt be that sexual with me these days aside from making out for some hours which I do consider sexual, but further than that she hasnt. Kissing, cuddling and holding hands is what we've done lately. I just wanted to ask her about it and she said its because our relationship is very emotional and that she loves me so much and feels she is now cheating and feels very guilty, but still wants to see me as usual. I'm supposed to take her out this weekend to do her nails at the salon and for dinner. Should I just say its fine? I still want to hang out with her. What is your opinion on this?

dating,147ylop,2023-06-12 21:46:03,Is he not interested or was this my fault?,"I went out on two dates with a guy who I really like and who ""seemed"" (at least I sensed that) to like me (he initiated the first two dates). Our second date was truly wonderful, literally the best date of my life. I could tell that he had a great time too. After our second I told him that I was interested in going out a third time and he gave me his number (we met through Tinder so we were chatting there). However, I had to leave town after our second date for a few days so we decided to plan something after I came back.  
When I was on my trip I was sharing pictures of the places I was visiting, telling him how beautiful everything was. But here is where he got very unresponsive. I would send him those texts and he would take MORE THAN 24 HOURS to reply to a text and his responses were pretty bland. He is not working this summer (he is a university student) and he told me that he spends a lot of time just at home so the excuse that he ""might be busy"" is not realistic. I texted him when I got back from my trip asking how he was doing and again his response was pretty bland and I just replied ""Great that you are doing good. I'm happy you've been having fun!"" (he was partying while I was away). He never replied to that text and it's been 4 days.  
My question is: Was I wrong for not asking him out again once I came back from my trip, or is his unresponsiveness a sign that he is not interested? I didn't ask him out because I considered his unresponsiveness a red flag and was waiting for him to bring up the topic so I could be sure he was still interested. Should I text him again even though he never replied to my last text or should I move on? I feel bad because I really felt like our two dates went really well.",

We then hookup at my house but because I‚Äôm a moron, I drank too much during the date and when I drink‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs just say it‚Äôs hard for me to stay 100% hard lol. I was like 75% most of the time.

We cuddled for hours and when it was time to leave she had a weird attitude and seemed standoffish. After getting NO responses after sending a bunch of texts she gives me her number and says she wants to hangout again. 

I tried to set something up, having normal convos and got nothing in response. As someone who knows they might have fucked up and has bad anxiety this drove me crazy and I asked why I‚Äôm being ghosted.

we broke up last september and i think we talked for the last time a few weeks ago. he said he wouldnt be talking to me anymore and that i need to move on, but i keep thinking that soon he will come back and be with me because he‚Äôs said the same before and texted me anyways but i have to treat it like the last time because theres a big chance that it really is. i never really fell out of love with him i really think hes the one and i never met anyone like them. i thought my future out with him too. hes so specifically what i want, i feel like my type is so specific and he fits everything. even how he treated me in the past i want to stay positive and hope he‚Äôs changed for the better.but i know i should stop being naive and really move on though.  i can maybe do it, but i dont think im strong enough. ive been pretty happy doing my own thing focusing on my own stuff but i think about him every day still and how i want to tell him everything and just having conversations in my mind and how our relationship would be if we were still together and wishing i could be happy and share these days with him. i keep thinking that he‚Äôll just text me and want to be with me again. but i have to think about the actual reality that he most likely wont. ill probably try to fake it till i make it and think im too good for him and he doesn‚Äôt deserve me or wtv lol but yea

dating,147xy8q,2023-06-12 21:17:44,Is He Avoidant Attachment?,"23(M) and 26(F).

I started dating a guy over a year ago. We dated for about 10 months before I broke it off. When we first met it was insane chemistry. The first night we talked for hours just overlooking some train tracks. The second night was the same, but on a roof top. He lived out of state but was planning to move to the region. I fell really hard and really fast, but tried to stay logical about it. We stayed in contact a lot and would have amazing text threads about anything and everything. We also started talking on the phone and the conversations would last for hours. He started watching my church online and we would have long conversations about God and religion on Sundays. He came and visited me after a month and we, once again, hit it off. He started looking for jobs in my city (I live in a great city with a ton of professional growth for his specific career interests). He just had to finish a contract where he was and he'd move.

After 2 months he asked me to be his girlfriend and said he was falling for me. I agreed to be in a relationship but did not respond with saying I was falling for him. I was nervous. After 5 months he told me he loved me. I said it back.

We talked about owning businesses together, real estate ventures, family values, core values, etc. It felt, to me, like I was vetting him and we were a great match. This was all long distance, but we would see each other for weekends at a time, and sometimes 2 weeks at a time. I met his family, he met my family. We went on a family vacation with my family. Everyone got along. I helped him paint and build a house. Everything was great.

Throughout there were small insecurities on his end that cropped up. I tried to help and make him feel better.

The contract ended and it was time to move, but he couldn't get a job right away. I thought that was relatively normal, but he was new out of undergrad and probably wasn't used to applying to tons of jobs. This is when it got bad. He started nitpicking me and correcting me in public (if he didn't like how my tone sounded). He started pointing out the things he didn't like about me. Things he once loved. I was too intense, how smart I was stressed him out, how healthy I was stressed him out, me making more money than him stressed him out, my voice was too intense, I wasn't warm enough.

He completely withdrew from me, and no matter what I did he wouldn't reciprocate. He still wanted to be intimate, he still wanted to cuddle, but it just was not the same. It felt forced. He didn't touch me like he used to, he didn't make me coffee anymore, he didn't really ask me questions about myself or my life. He also completely gave up on God and started insinuating that our relationship was coincidental and not related to God (opposite of what he was saying at the beginning).

I called for a break and told him to think on what he wants. The break did nothing. He came back still flaky saying he wasn't sure he wanted to move, he didn't know what jobs he wanted. He started saying he was interested in other things that were never on the table, like spending weekends drinking beer and hanging with his buddies (who were not great people). Opposite of the entrepreneur I thought he was. He put no effort to mend our relationship. He was unemployed and didn't even come down to see me and try make things better (I was in school getting a doctroate, I couldn't go to him).

I was on a roller coaster, so I ended it. He wrote me a letter a few weeks later apologizing, saying he was moving, saying he loved me and apologizing for not guarding my heart, promising to win my trust back, etc. Then silence for a month.  Contacted me a month later saying he was in town looking at jobs and wanted to talk. Over the phone he told me the previous letter he sent was done in a fit of emotion. He took it all back. Said he couldn't commit to me even if he moved here.

Well, I just got word he had moved here a month ago. He snuck a letter under my door apologizing profusely, explaing he got ""lost"" and why, wanting to get back together, and saying he will do everything in his power to work on us. That he is committed. That his stress from the job search, financial stress from his father (which is valid), and stress about him being in the national guard got to him and made him question our relationship. That he now realizes relationships take a lot of work, and he wants to put in the work. That he wants to pursue and provide for me. That he loves me and misses me. I didn't respond because I was very overwhelmed.

He snuck another letter under my door and my favorite chocolates. He also now goes to my church despite there being about a billion churches in my city and him actually living half an hour away.

I am not considering taking him back right now. But in a year or so if he worked on himself maybe it wouldn't be off the table?

Is he a typical avoidant or is he just immature? Or both? Or a narcissist? How much is too much? What are normal hurdles for a relationship? Am I just signing up for a huge push-pull relationship where he love bombs me again and then withdraws it all at the first sign of adversity? Sorry for the long story.. :(","Never tolerate any form of disrespect. I have never disrespected any woman in public to try and embarass her. It sounds like he doesn't have a lot of good coping skills to deal with his issues in a positive way. Sounds like he could use some spirtual and mental health guidance. He could be an avoidant attatchment style but if you take him back set some clear boundaries. If he crosses them or his behavior doesn't improve, then move on. Women need a guy that can help them improve their life and make them a better person. Not dragging the women he supposedly loves down. You should ask him what his definition of love is and how he knows he's in love with you. Put him on the spot. Love is progressive and takes quite a long time to develop sometimes. A lot of people mistake infatuation and obession with love, so be careful."

Anyways, here is the situation. I met one girl while traveling and she showed interest in me (like asking for my Insta, telling me that we should go to a coffee someday and so on) and I told myself: well, why not? 

So I called her for a date (we did not call it that way, but I think we both are aware it is) and she agreed. I am still unsure how I feel about her, but why not to give it a try, after being dating avoidant for so long? At best, something nice can happen, and at worst - we will both gain some experience and have some good time.

However, there is this another girl that works in a store I regularly go to - and she always smiles to me, looks at me and gives me some vibe that I think might be ""I am interested in you thing"". Last time I started talking to her and we exchanged few words, but there were other customers so I had to leave, not to get her in trouble. Now, this might mean nothing, just a small talk. Still, I realised I might want to try to ask her for a number when I see her next time, and if she agrees, call her on a date.

Now, is this fair play? Or should I wait for one date to finish and see what will come from the first situation before approaching the other girl?","Yes ... Dating is fickle business .. You never know who stays and who disappears.

I used to do alright before and go on quite a few dates with conventionally attractive women every week. I'm definitely not a model, but I'm above average to some.

My problem is that finding someone to commit and be exclusive was difficult. Most women who match with me are looking for casual sex or short-term relationships (from my experience). I also see that the prices for memberships are up, and now there are more tiers for priority card placement. I'm not super interested in a rat race to spend the most money possible just to be seen, or weird microtransactions.

For those of you who are older (>27), what is the app experience like now?","Hinge is probably your best best, I'd say that's geared more towards people who want something more serious. There's an option when you're filling out your profile to choose what you're looking for and ""long-term relationship"" is an option.

Since you're in a pretty populated city and you say that you used to be able to go on multiple dates a week, I think you'll be fine."

I regretted sending it, and after a day of ignoring it, asking myself if I should even reply to that. I decided to just say: well, no hard feelings. Wish you the best.

I don't intend to contact her again. Guess I just wanted to wrap it up in a friendly way. Question is, was that an appropriate thing to send?","dude move on and focus on other things right now, who care if it‚Äôs appropriate it or not, shes not into you."

A couple of days before we got into an argument that I insinuated about him hanging out with this certain ‚Äúfriend‚Äù I then apologized a couple days later. We made up, it was what it was. My birthday is 5 days after him and we were planning a trip to Hawaii which I took days off work. The day of his birthday I texted him right at 12:30 am wishing him a happy birthday.

He then went to the club afterwards with his friends as well as some female friends. I was furious and betrayed and felt so stupid.

dating,147x4bi,2023-06-12 20:42:27,How can I recover from a brush off from a guy I liked during a party ?,"Throwaway account!  
I met this guy at a party on Friday. We clicked instantly, danced together for a while. Before he left, he asked if I would be there tomorrow since there was another party the next night from the same organisers (This party was part of an string of events organised by the same group, latin dancing to be precise, so the same folks were mingling over the weekend) I told I was going to be there and Ill see him then. I was excited all the next day. Come Saturday night, I got there and he wasn't there yet.   
I started mingling and dancing but had one eye on the door all night!  
When he did turn up, he didn't acknowledge me right away. I figured we were just a bit awkward. (I was certainly) By the time he was close enough for me to say hi, another woman had asked him for a dance. He did said hello before he went up to the floor. But it all went downhill from there. I was dancing with another guy by the time he was done.  
And most of the night he was surrounded by people, and had another woman at his side all the night. 

I tried to ignore him and had a good time anyway.He left the party early. Now that sun has risen on a new day, Im thinking back if I could have salvaged the situation by asking him for a dance instead of fuming that he didn't and becoming defensive (thats how I was feeling anyway)  
Now to the advice I am seeking, since we didn't exchange numbers, would it be weird to hit him up on FB (we share common friends and groups) and just start a casual chat or even tell him that I missed dancing with him previous night. Is that too thirsty? Its hard to find connections and I don't want to lose out as I have done countless times before where I was afraid to make a move.  
TLDR: I connected with this guy at a party. We met again the next night at a similar event, but things went cold. I am wondering if there is a way I can reconnect with him after we ignored each other the next night",
dating,147x0oa,2023-06-12 20:38:11,Dating advice re conversation topics,"I am a woman in my mid-20s, I haven‚Äôt been on a date in a while and I recently went on a date with a man in his 30s. He had just gotten off work and I asked how work was going, he said ‚Äúfine,‚Äù I asked if it had been busy, he said ‚Äúyeah,‚Äù I asked how long had he been working there he said x years and since they were all one or two-word responses I thought maybe he didn‚Äôt want to talk about his job so I started talking about the restaurant‚Äôs decorations and if he liked them, again he said ‚Äúyeah.‚Äù I then said laughingly ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry if my conversation topics aren‚Äôt good. Here I am talking about decorations. Let‚Äôs see, oh I saw a good movie the other day. Have you seen any good movies lately?‚Äù He said ‚Äúno.‚Äù He never asked me any questions. At the end of the date we hugged each other and I asked how he felt about it and he said ‚ÄúI feel fine but you are really socially awkward. The conversation didn‚Äôt flow.‚Äù Now I feel bad about being called really socially awkward-he still asked me on another date but I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm supposed to talk about if I go on another date with him or anyone else","Hi! I want to begin by saying to you to not let someone like that make such an off comment and mess with your head. If YOU are really socially awkward, then how about you give him a dose of his own medicine?!? On the next date, keep it very blah - one word responses, don't ask any questions, enjoy the food and drinks, then at the end of the night, hug and say, ""Good night."" Most cases, people are not able to handle the things they dish out. Another way to look at this situation is to keep in mind he had just gotten off work. Most times, people are drained - low energy and just want to go home after work. I believe if he did, in fact, feel this way, he should've communicated that and reschedule the date to a better day, maybe not a work day. 

There are SO many topics to discuss on a date. The key is both people have to be interested in carrying the conversation, not one person. Personally, I would consider dating other people, not unless you are very interested in him. It could have just been an off day for him... maybe he can give you a better understanding if you bring it up. Hope this helps!"

dating,147wukl,2023-06-12 20:31:02,Any tips for remaining hopeful when faced with constant dating failure?,"I'm a 28M. My day-to-day life has not afforded me any opportunities to meet single women around my age. My day is mostly occupied by work, but when I'm free, I enjoy hanging with friends, going to bars and breweries, going to the dog park or taking my dog on walks, playing on volleyball leagues, golfing, working out, making music, and reading. I've tried other group activities like workout classes, martial arts classes, rock climbing, etc. but it seems like no matter where I go and no matter how long I remain involved in said activity, I never come into contact with single women. I figured playing co-ed volleyball would be very fruitful, but I've been playing on different teams for a couple years now and have only met married women.

So that leaves me with dating apps. I mainly use Hinge, and I've had my profiles reviewed online and by friends and family. Through that process, I've taken all new photos and spent a lot of time experimenting with different combinations of photos and bios. While I've seen a greater frequency of incoming likes, I almost never get likes from women I am attracted to. I place a high importance on being career-driven and fitness, and it seems like every woman that sends me a like is the exact opposite of this, OR they simply do not have well-made profiles that allow me to even see what they look like (blurry or bad photos, filters, etc.).

So I make it a point to carefully vet the profiles I come across, selectively send likes, and make sure to only send likes to women I feel are in or around my league in terms of their physical appearance and lifestyle. I send the max likes per day, yet only get maybe one or two matches every few months. And these matches either never reply, will exchange a couple messages before never responding or unmatching, or they unmatch immediately before I can send a message. Have yet to go on a single date from dating apps.

I've been single and have not dated or been romantic with any women since 2019 despite trying to put myself out there in person and online. I don't really feel like I'm doing anything wrong with my approach, and I would chalk most of my failure up to bad luck as well as an inherent outcome as a result of poor gender ratios which make it significantly harder for men to get matches. Just wondering how folks in a similar situation maintain hope and have been able to push through considerable and consistent failure. I feel like I have a lot to offer in a relationship, and I see many of my colleagues and friends have no issue getting dates from both dating apps and in person. I really don't want to give up, but I'm starting to think dating may not be for me.",It‚Äôs hard but you need to focus on yourself i‚Äôve been there couple of time stop chasing enjoy your life
dating,147wtbw,2023-06-12 20:29:43,At what point do you get vulnerable in dating someone?,"I‚Äôm starting to date again and I‚Äôm having so much trouble gauging when to start getting deep and vulnerable with the conversations. I‚Äôm generally used to dating emotionally unavailable men. I‚Äôm also not comfortable with being vulnerable. I‚Äôve come to terms it‚Äôs not something I‚Äôll become comfortable with until I start doing it. It‚Äôll never come naturally to me and that‚Äôs okay but I still need to do it. My issue is I have a hard time gauging when its the right time to ask those difficult and deep questions. 

For me, the first date is just getting to know each other at a very basic level. What are their plans for the future(broad) are. I‚Äôm not really asking any deep questions. Just the basic compatibility questions like ‚Äúdo you want kids‚Äù etc. and is there general attraction. 

My question is when do you start initiating and asking the real deep questions like what are your your dreams, what was your childhood traumas, etc. stuff that tells you a lot about the person, the super deep stuff(without feeling like I‚Äôm prodding) This stuff does NOT come naturally to me so just waiting til the time is right DOESNT work lol. I‚Äôve tried!! I don‚Äôt want to wait for someone to coax it out of me either bc I want to take responsibility. 

Are there general bench marks??? Do you wait til the third date??? Do you just whip out a deep question while you‚Äôre cooking together???? I genuinely don‚Äôt know how to put it into practice. I want to‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs just totally new territory. 

Also, they‚Äôre probably well aware that I‚Äôm uncomfortable asking these questions. It‚Äôs not bc I don‚Äôt want to know. I was just conditioned to not ask those kinds of questions. So i don‚Äôt know how to be chill about it either lol 

Any advice is welcome lol

Edit: 

To make my questions clearer.. 
- how do you approach the questions?
- what questions do you ask? 
- how do I get myself to chill out when I ask these questions?? 
- how do I make the other person comfortable enough to share?","I think it's fair game to start getting into the deeper questions on the 2nd and 3rd dates.

You can ease into them by asking if they're cool with it by saying something like, 'Is it okay if I ask you some stuff about your childhood?' for example."

If she‚Äôs more a shy nice id recommend taking things slowly and just befriending her (shy girls are sometimes thrown off bu strong energy) but if she‚Äôs more of a talkative, straightforward girl then you can shoot your shoot and be straightforward and tell her she caught you eye, Ask her what she likes doing for fun and tell her you‚Äôre taking here there (to whatever she likes to do).

dating,147wmas,2023-06-12 20:21:11,Unhealthy Crushes on Celebrities affecting Real Relationships?,"I'm feeling a bit lost and I could really use some advice. I'm almost 22, and I've never been in a romantic relationship with anyone. Lately, I've been reflecting on my behavior. 

I find myself constantly developing intense crushes on celebrities, particularly actors since I was 15. Sometimes I even create fake scenarios in my head before bed, and surprisingly, many of my celebrity crushes have shown up in my dreams at least once. This has only deepened my feelings for them, even though they don't even know I exist, and most of them live in another country. And the next morning I woke, I always feeling lost and empty.

I'm beginning to realize that this is becoming a serious issue for me. After dreaming about them, I find it difficult to sleep at night, and I often catch myself obsessively stalking their social media accounts, as well as their families or friends and i cried a lot because I'm aware that this behavior is not healthy.

So, my question to you all is: Is it normal to have such intense crushes on celebrities like this? Has anyone else experienced something similar? If so, how did you overcome it? I'm open to any advice or suggestions you may have.

I was thinking maybe this is the reasons why I never had a real relationship with somebody. What should I do then? I'm not sure I could find a real relationship either.","I am no expert and I‚Äôve never experienced this (to this extent) but maybe you should reflect on the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù you are doing this? 

Like why are you spending so much time in people that are not near or engaged with you, and once you find it try to work on that. 

For example I would disassociate and spend hours imagining my perfect life, what I would have done differently when having difficult or stressful times that I didn‚Äôt want to deal with, once I faced them, I started to decrease little by little until I was able to actually enjoy my real life. 

Still daydream a lot though but just before going to sleep ü§≠ü§≠ 

(My point being: is not necessarily the obsessing over them but the why you are doing it what‚Äôs preventing you from finding joy and appreciating the people around you that could be potential partners)

dating,147wk54,2023-06-12 20:18:41,I didn‚Äôt see that coming,"Okay‚Ä¶ so the story goes like this. A few years ago I met this guy. I‚Äôm a female in my twenties and he is in his thirties. We met thanks to a book club. The book club was online, so the meeting were virtual and we didn‚Äôt meet face to face after a year of knowing each other.   
We started talking and we connected almost instantly. He had had his ups and downs in life and he confessed to me that he was still a virgin. We shared tough stuff about our lives so the friendship grew bigger and stronger everyday. We talk every single day, almost 24/7. At one point, we realised that the chemistry was undeniable. There was something more going on. But, in that time I was in a long- term relationship of almost 8 years. And although I was≈Ñt in the best terms with my partner, I wanted to make it work.  
After a year, we started to hang out with the book club. We used to go out or to have dinners together. So, of course, we finally meet with this guy. And OMG the atraction was palpable. Even friends thought we were a couple. Every time he moved closer o he touch me, made me feel butterflies all over my body. He is a touchy person, you know.. the kind of people that says something and put your hand on your arms.  
But then.. almost two years after, the feeling was too obvious to hide and it was really hard to just being friends. So we decided to put a distance between us and stop talking. In that time I tried to make thing work with my boyfriend but it was a toxic relationship and I couldn‚Äôt put up with that anymore, so we broke up.  
Moving fast forward, I reconnected with this guy. He told me that he had missed me, and that it was hurtful not speaking to me. We started talking again, and the feeling was still there. As I am single, trying to learn how to be single again, we decided to take thing slow and be friend with benefits.   
Last week we decided to be together \[sexually speaking\]. I was feeling sexy, excited, I even bought the condoms. We were really nervous. Me, because only a boy had seen me naked, and him because of his lack of sexual experience. I decided to take control of the situation. We laid in bed and I told him to close his eyes and I kissed him. He started laughing. I could feel how nervous he was. How embarrassed he felt. I told him that if he felt insecure or something we could stop. I didn‚Äôt want to force him. After a few minutes, we had sex. It was a bit awkward but I don‚Äôt know.. I put on my rose coloured glasses.  
Now, it‚Äôs when everything starts to feel strange. We hang out later that evening, and we were just fine. We had fun together, he was really caring and kind. But since earlier, the connection was a little bit off. Every time I kissed him, he acted tense. He told me he didn‚Äôt feel comfortable with the kissing stuff..but he didn‚Äôt know why. He was surprised. Even disappointed. And for me..kissing is as erotic o even more erotic that the sexual stuff. The only thing he told me, it‚Äôs that he thinks that unconsciously he may be putting emotional distance because he is afraid of one of us being hurt.   
We keep talking because we‚Äôre surprised that the connection we felt and that it was so strong, doesn‚Äôt reflect on our actions.  
Since the day I met him, all I ever wanted to do is kiss him. But he told me that he never thought of that, which is kind of a bummer. We keep talking, because we are trying to find a solution o an explanation of what is going on between us.  
I‚Äôm not asking what to do.. I just wanted to share this story and I don‚Äôt know..maybe someone out there had an experience similar to mine and I wouldn‚Äôt make me feel so alone.",

dating,147wgvq,2023-06-12 20:14:46,What is going on with this guy? Completely lost.,"2 years ago I hooked up with a guy and I thought was going to end up in a relationship. However I asked him if he was seeing more girls, and he took that as offensive, so he told me that he didn't want to keep talking to me or seeing me. 

He was actually very rude when telling me and I ugly cried because I really was crushing on him.

Fast forward a few months and he completely ignored me whenever we saw each other in public and if I stood next to him at the bar we usually frequent he would go out or move elsewhere so that he didn't have me nearby. He also got in a long-term relationship.

Last year I saw him almost passed out drunk on the stairs and I asked him if he was okay because I was honestly worried that something might happen if I left him there and he said he was fine. And so we started talking and I told him that I don't want any kinds of negativity between us because I saw he was very happy with his girlfriend and he said ""yes you should meet her, she's the nicest!"". In my head that was a truce.

However a few months later whenever I saw him he would also keep avoiding me. Obviously never saying hello. It was very deliberate. All this time he was following me on Instagram and watching all of my stories (not liking my pics, though). Whenever I was alone with a guy (any guy friend of mine) even if he didn't know him and he would pass by the guy to use the restroom or exit the place (the bar is very narrow), he'd tap tap on the guy's shoulder as a ""bro move"". Again, not saying hi to me or anything.

It was the same until a couple days ago when I went out he saw me with a couple male friends at a concert and kept staring at me and talking about me with his group (one of his friends is an acquaintance of mine). They even turned to look at me. After that, everyone headed to the bar where he saw me enter and stared at me, even turning around after I walked past him (he'd usually avoid me like the plague). A guy I know invited me and one of my guy friends for drinks and we were in the same group as him, which was so awkward. A few hours later I heard him and this acquaintance of mine talk while giving me looks periodically and the acquaintance said ""go talk to her"" and he was like ""no, man, I'd rather not"" and the acquaintance responded with ""you'll never know what you're missing"". 

All that time I was alone, chatting with one of my guy friends that came with me to the concert because the other one had gone home already. 
After that I said goodbye to this acquaintance of mine and while we were walking away (me and my friend), the acquaintance shouted ""you better take care of her, you love birds!""

And this guy (the crush) looked at my guy friend and I and he sized him up and down without saying anything as we walked away.

I don't understand anything or where he stands at. I don't want to ask him because he was rude once and don't want him to think I care after 2 years. Can any guy explain what the hell is going on?","Just move on, this guy is in the past"
dating,147wex5,2023-06-12 20:12:23,dating phase vs exclusive phase?,"Over the weekend I [24m] went on 2 first dates with 2 separate women. I matched with both of them essentially at the same time and started talking with them at the same time. I planned the date on sunday first with one of them, and then later in the week planned the date on saturday with the other.

The date on saturday went well and we were definitely into each other. We went out and talked all night and planned a bunch of activities to do for our future dates and have one lined up for next weekend. Time flew and overall had a lot of fun

On sunday, this date was planned to be a lot more peaceful. I kept my expectations and commitment low beforehand, but it turns out she‚Äôs really cool and we have a lot in common. We talked a lot about common interests and overall felt comfortable with each other. When we both went home we kept on talking and played video games until I went to bed. We have a date planned for later today. 

The thing is, I‚Äôve never been in this position before. I have pretty low self esteem and I don‚Äôt have much dating experience in general. I would be lucky to be talking to even one person I‚Äôm interested in. I know it‚Äôs early and that I‚Äôve only had 1 date with both of them, but things are starting to progress at a steady rate with both of them. I can‚Äôt help but feel like I‚Äôm somehow being unfaithful by dating and investing effort/emotions in someone else at the same time when I‚Äôm interested in the other person. 

What are some of your thoughts on my situation, and the general etiquete of moving from the dating phase to an exclusive phase?","Hi friend, That's tough but you can't take a first date too seriously - They could also be seeing other people - I think just being transparent about it would be best. You aren't committed to either of them yet."
dating,147wcq0,2023-06-12 20:09:48,How do you say goodbye?,"I met this girl 6 months ago and we hit it off, we are literally the same person even down to the birthday. 

We spoke everyday, flirted, we met a few times and we've been helping her get to where she wants to be after a 'rough patch'. We both said we liked each other and wanted to see eachother again when she came back from her mother's.

Then one day it changed. She didn't an barely speaks to me and if I don't reply she'll tell me she misses me then goes right back to being quiet.

I understand now she's getting better she'll want to be with her friends, maybe even date again etc and she's also left today for a festival with her friend for a break.

I'm thinking we've hit our end but I'm not sure how to say goodbye? If I need to and when to? I don't want to spoil her trip.

Thanks for any advice",
dating,147w9pk,2023-06-12 20:06:07,Tips re how to be open minded but also follow instincts,"Long story short‚ÄîI was in a LTR (7yrs), and didn‚Äôt date for couple years. I have been dating on the apps only the last 6mos. As I‚Äôve read from others in a similar situation, I feel like I‚Äôve forgotten how to date. 

I am trying to figure out how to keep an open mind, but also make sure I am pursuing people I actually want to date. In the beginning I was overwhelmed by the number of people, and now I can see who I‚Äôm into, who I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll work with, and people I am certain it‚Äôs a no. 

My question is about that middle group, where I think it‚Äôs probably a no, but I don‚Äôt have enough data to be certain. I am worried about wasting people‚Äôs time with my uncertainty, so at first i thought I shouldn‚Äôt pursue anything unless I‚Äôm 100% certain. But then I realize that‚Äôs not rational. 

And ya‚Äôll this is literally ONLY in the messaging stage where I‚Äôm having these thoughts. 

How do you know if you want to go on a date with someone you meet with on an app? 

Have you experienced situations where you don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a go, but then in person it‚Äôs totally different? 

What are good questions to ask on an app when you want to know if they are looking for something serious or casual?",
dating,147w7lx,2023-06-12 20:03:38,Crushing on best friend and I‚Äôm not sure where to go,"I (17M) am heavily crushing on my best friend (17F) and I don‚Äôt know what to do.  I‚Äôve tried giving hits, I sent her stuff that kinda leans towards it, but nothing.  Both me and her can be very oblivious to many things, so the signs might just be flying over her head, and she could be giving me signs and I don‚Äôt realize.  

My biggest concern is losing her, I‚Äôm scared that I‚Äôll ask her out, and she‚Äôll drop me entirely, and I don‚Äôt want to lose her. 

If by some miracle we do start dating I can see it working out.  She‚Äôs going to college this fall while I‚Äôll be a senior in college.  She‚Äôll be living at home and we live 5 minutes together, we both do community band when it‚Äôs the season so we see each other weekly, and her college isn‚Äôt even 25mins away so we could make it work.  I went to her graduation and met her family, and she‚Äôll soon meet mine.

I‚Äôm still just scared of losing her, all my friends that know urge me to make a move but I‚Äôm just too worried and anxiety filled.  I want to make her happy and if doesn‚Äôt want more then we won‚Äôt be more.  

Its funny we like get asked a bunch if we‚Äôre dating bc we spend so much time together, like two weekends ago I went with her and her parents to their lake house in AL lol.  We‚Äôve even tricked people before that we were, and it was super believable.

TL;DR I am hard crushing on my best friend, but I don‚Äôt want to lose her so I don‚Äôt know where to go",
dating,147w6n2,2023-06-12 20:02:33,Blocked me from viewing his story,"I met this guy while I was out about a year ago. Since then, he asked me out on a date (it didn‚Äôt happen since I was busy). Since then, he never asked again but we would flirt via dm and he alluded to us hanging out. Well I noticed he unfollowed me, not a big deal. I didn‚Äôt know if it was an accident or what, so I just continued to follow. I noticed he hadn‚Äôt posted in awhile, so I thought maybe something happened. Well, turns out he just blocked me from viewing his story (which I saw from my business page). It was a post of him and his gf / woman he‚Äôs dating I‚Äôm guessing.

I don‚Äôt get why he‚Äôd unfollow me AND block me from viewing his story. Because it seems like he wants to hide his gf, but he wouldn‚Äôt unfollow if he wanted to keep me around.
So I truly don‚Äôt know the reason. Just seeing if anyone else has a possible explanation.","there are a few possibilities:

- He could be trying to simplify or declutter his own social media interactions. He might be unfollowing people he isn't closely connected with or people he doesn't interact with regularly.

- He may be trying to create boundaries in his new relationship. Maybe his new partner feels uncomfortable with him maintaining online connections with women he has flirted with in the past, so he's chosen to respect those boundaries.

- He might be trying to avoid causing you discomfort or confusion by seeing posts about his new relationship, especially if there was an element of flirtation in your previous interactions.

- Finally, he may just not want you to have a window into his personal life for reasons that have nothing to do with you specifically.

His actions on social media likely say more about him and his current situation than they do about you. It can be frustrating and confusing when someone's online behavior changes, but try not to take it personally."
dating,147w465,2023-06-12 19:59:58,I [F 21] feel men offer fwb with me because I'm not attractive enough for a relationship,"I am in my 20's and I haven't had a real offer for a relationship ever. Men are so quick to offer fwb or casual hookups with me and never ever something serious. It's a little frustrating. Many people say it's because of my age, but I disagree... a lot of these men that offer casual relationships to me are quick to get in relationships with other women or have a dream girl in mind.

&#x200B;

Also before anyone says that they must be attracted to you somewhat or they wouldn't go out with you or make these offers. To that, I say there are many people who have lower standards for fwb and casual relationships. I feel like at most I'm passable looking to most men, but I'm never anyone they would show off.

&#x200B;

It's really frustrating because I've tried dating men who are more similar in attractiveness but they've been the same way. I feel humiliated that I'm not really good enough for anything real. I've been considering cosmetic procedures to improve my appearance. I've been doing all the typical things like working out, taking care of skin and exploring my hobbies more.  I have also upgraded my style and I'm in therapy again. I think at this point it's just how I look.

I just wish men wouldn't offer these fwb or casual relationships to me anymore...","I can't say I know how u feel but all m gonna say is u'll find someone that'll commit to you soon, someone that'll love you endlessly, someone that'll make u feel like the queen you are.. Just be patient"

So, while I keep trying I'd like to know, what is some advice or tips or things you wish you had known when you started dating ?",

However, she started becoming distant and showing signs of disinterest in the last month.(flaking on plans, giving me the ""I fell asleep"" texts) I eventually ended things because I wanted a relationship and she didn't and that it wouldn't be fair to either of us. She later texted me with a ""I think about you""  after some weeks no contact, but seemed indifferent when I suggested meeting up. We had another conversation about breaking up, mainly about how she shouldn't talk to me unless it's to reconsider and she apologized for not being able to give me what I wanted because of her recent break up but that I have a special place in her life/heart and that our paths would cross again 100%.  I feel really strongly about this girl and would love to make it work. Lately I feel like I made a mistake asking for a relationship from her and should have kept going slow and steady. Did I blow this up, or is she just not that into me? I want to reach out and go back on my original break up to try again but slower but I'm sure this would make me look pathetic.","If she reached out to you 2 weeks later without you contacting her, she is into you. 

There is nothing wrong with texting her ‚Äúyou want to give it another go and we can take it slow this time?‚Äù
If you‚Äôre ok with that. 

Just don‚Äôt fully invest emotionally and be mentally prepared for it to end at anytime."
dating,147vxsa,2023-06-12 19:52:32,I was used by a man who I thought liked me but I still feel bad?,"I went out three times with this guy. We texted everyday and had great dates at first. I saw him a few days ago and had a nice time. He stayed over and you know the rest. He promptly got up, got dressed and left. I then never spoke to him again and he unmated me on the dating app where we met.

I asked him why since it was out of the blue. He said I didn‚Äôt really seem interested and made him uninterested. I don‚Äôt understand why when I don‚Äôt believe I gave off that impression. He tried to make me feel bad about feeling used and told me I was the one who made it seem like he should leave after. I was just laying there next to him? 

Anyways, I feel like crap. I wasn‚Äôt trying to be used, I wasn‚Äôt looking for sex, I was upfront about what I wanted. 

Yet I was used once again and throw away like garbage. I don‚Äôt know what more I can do on dates to get my point across. This was even my first time going back into dating after 8 months because of something similar. Why do I feel so shitty?","üíñ it happens to the best of us, sometimes we are looking in the wrong place or have some sort of pattern we are blindly attracting or chasing andddd some other times we just find shitty people 

Based on what you said, you were clear on what you wanted and tried, but if you are lied to, what can you do? 

You didn‚Äôt hurt anyones feeling. 
You didn‚Äôt lie 
You didn‚Äôt take advantage of someone‚Äôs honesty
You were true to yourself
You followed your instinct

It happens, and you learn, I feel you are in the gut path, but that does not mean you need to rush though it, you can rest, take a while, gather yourself, find happiness in yourself and other things, and the. Pick up from where you left üíñ

There‚Äôs good people out there, you are proof of it, so it might take a while to find someone, but there are out there.

dating,147vtu7,2023-06-12 19:47:58,Extremely Confused,"Hey y'all! 30F here! I've been seeing a 29M off and on since January of this year. 

He has been ALL. OVER. THE. PLACE. But not in a BAD way - he just pops up asking to go out or hang out, we're always sending each other memes on IG, texting small talk. We work together so I see him every day, it's not awkward or anything. When we first started getting to know each other better in January, I had mentioned kids weren't something I had envisioned YET (just no right person to make me want to have children yet). That was big enough for him to say something along the lines of ""maybe this won't work, she doesn't want kids"" and he kind of backed off for a while until I was able to explain it better, and he seemed to understand but then didn't really talk to him for about a month or so...

The last few weeks though, he has been more consistent, but I can't figure him out. Our jobs are super busy, and 8-5 is reserved for work. But I feel like I've dropped a million hints for him...he's such a sweetheart, and I feel like he's nervous or scared. He'll go quiet for a few days, and then pop back up. 

We've only been on two official dates (LMAO), and we've hung out just a handful of times, but the conversations have never been ""what are you looking for here?"", ya know? 

Is he scared to make a more serious move? Should I make a more serious move? 

Need some insight YALL!!",You realize you can ask him these questions right? The main issue here is that you're dancing around the difficult topics - probably because you're both scared

I (22,f) am ace who found another ace (22,m) through social media. I have never once dated in my life. Initially we did not speak but I adored him from afar. We spoke back and forth eventually and then he asked me out on a date.   
Today for the first time he called me his girlfriend and I don't know that just made me feel so warm. This man gives me hope and I think I really want to hope again. We already have more than one date planned. He assured me that we don't need to hurry. He calls me beautiful names and I'm kinda less scared now, till the insecurities kick in. I have learnt to love myself and I still do try every day. We have talked about it.   
I have never once expected to be accepted as ace and I am more than glad to have found him. On most days we are on the same page. And the days when we are not, we talk. He makes it easy to talk.

dating,147vnlg,2023-06-12 19:40:47,How to achieve self-confidence as a man?,"Most of us men have heard this phrase many time, ""Women can sense when you lack self-confidence"". And to women, I found out thag it's a big turn-off when men are not confident. 

I am not an attractive man. I think i'm quite ugly. Yes i'm tall and kinda in shape (lean, but quite skinny), but my looks are just whack imo. So sometimes i talk to women and they say shit like ""you look cute"", and i just know that its bs. I'll disagree and i can sense them moving away after that. So personally, i can vouch that have no self-confidence is a turn-off to women. 

So i need some advice guys and gals. I truly believe i'm not good looking, but how can i be confident? How the hell can i have true self-confidence when i know im definitely ugly? And i take most compliments and scoff at it like ""yea sure, i know thats a lie"", u know what i mean? It's like self-sabotage at this point, but i SRSLY CANT HELP IT. SO HELP ME PLS, I DONT BELIEVE IN MYSELF","You don't. Everyone else here is going to lie to you but the fact is self confidence comes from previous success. If you don't have previous success and are ""self confident"" that just makes you delusional and people can tell if you're delusional."
dating,147vlel,2023-06-12 19:38:17,What are your thoughts on exclusively dating younger people?,"A friend (31M) intentionally put his age filter on a dating app at 21 to 33, because ‚Äú33 yo or older women often have a child wish‚Äù and he is ‚Äújust looking to date and to have fun and is not looking for a long term relationship or life partner‚Äù. He only went on dates with younger women.

I (33F without a child wish) thought this was a bit ageist and misogynistic (ETA: wrong wording, I meant biased) but maybe I‚Äôm overreacting. I‚Äôm not against age differences in dating per se, but I feel it‚Äôs different when you meet someone you like and matches your level of maturity but happens to be much younger versus actively seeking out younger women.

When I expressed him my opinion he told me I was judgmental and implicated I was a bad friend. And maybe I am? I‚Äôm curious to hear other people‚Äôs perspectives.","These apps allow you to hyperfocus on a few different superficial statistics. One of them is typically distance and the other is age. So people will be judgemental asshats with those parameters.

When people meet in person a lot of those superficial requirements go out the window.

Some apps allow women to filter men on height. Then they almost all say they want a guy 6 feet or taller just because that filter exists. But you already know that if they meet a 5'8 cool attractive dude in real life that height requirement probably flies out the window. 

So yes, he's judgemental. But so are you for judging him. So give him a break and give yourself a break. Be glad men can't filter on boob size or weight, or there would be a pandemonium.

We can't choose who or what we're attracted to. Don't bring political correctness into that. We're animals. Sex and relationships etc. Is driven by feelings and biological drives less than logic and political correctness. It isn't misandrist to desire a tall guy and it isn't misogynistic to desire a younger girl. Humans are just wired that way"

I have been staying here with them on and off after a few years of working overseas. I recently got back from a trip, and decided to stay here a bit longer so that I can switch jobs to something local. For the entirety of the time I've been staying here I've noticed this guy that lives down the hall. We've talked on and off in passing and have some sort of very specific greeting pretty much each time we walk by (would be a stretch to call it an inside-joke type of thing of course but similar feeling?). Aside from that I'm pretty introverted and I can assume from his overall vibe that he is in the same boat. Obviously, I find him attractive, but I can't say if he feels the same though I can say that I'm fairly attractive / not recently unattractive (lol) based off my experiences.

Also, to make this slightly more interesting: my mom has befriended all of her / our neighbors very easily for as long as I've known her... and surprise surprise, she has befriended this guy as well! She's actually tried to get me outside when she sees he is out there so she can 'introduce' us, but timing hasn't worked out in that regard. I'm almost thinking of just going for it and writing a quick note to put on his door with my number asking if he's single and giving maybe some details. He lives literally 4 doors down from me and I've seen him enter / exit his apartment many times before, so I doubt he'd be surprised that I know where he lives. But... I have no idea what details, or when, etc. OR if it would be the weirdest thing ever and to just burn down the whole idea... :P

Throwaway account for obvious reasons. Any ideas?","I would say that it may be a little creepy. Even if you‚Äôre sure that he‚Äôs aware you know where he lives, and it doesn‚Äôt sound like you have bad intentions, it may be best to wait until your mom does have time to introduce you two."

 Immediatly we discuss all the time, from the morning  to the night and after 1-2 month we were exclusive,  but she still dont want the couple thing.

The thing is, we acting and doing thing like √† couple, see each other 4 day a week 
She told me thing like i miss you, cant wait to seeing you, i care of you, i dont want to lose you and , on top of that,  we d√©clare our feeling mutualy.

2 week ago, we have have THE conversation, and she told me, she dont want to be in couple because its not gonna work

I was in shock since, for 4 month it was perfect and she was thinking, thing not gonna work between us but for small d√©tails, like, im a morning person not her or she reading book and i prefer movie

After this conversation, i told her i need time to make d√©cision and she increase the number of ""dont want to lose you"" yadayada 
I even ask her if she was happy with me, she agreed without thinking twice.

After that, i decided to continue the relation, telling her to let thing come as our relation going well and i was quite sure we gonna be happy together.

After that she become more distant, no more i miss you or cant wait to seeing you.

And last week, she told me she got a "" descent of feeling"" and i decided to stop thing before i gonna get hurt really bad

Two day after she send me a message drunk telling me that he misses me and she want me to be with her at this time.

We talk about it after and she confirm she dont want the couple but have feeling and the ""descent of feeling"" was for make me take distant.

I've been rejected for test tubes and single motherhood as a better option now. 

That one hurt. It now tops my worst you're not my type excuses. I thought not being ""sexually attractive"" was a burner but this one stings.

This will be our 4th date, and I‚Äôm well aware of the context of the date, but I was wondering what the social graces are as I haven‚Äôt dated much since college. 

I told him I wanted to bring something, and he said beer would be great. I will grab a local beer from my shop as I consider myself quite the beer connoisseur, and he has told me in the past what kinds of beer he enjoys. Should I bring anything else? He has a home outside the city, and I feel it improper to show up without flowers or something, but he‚Äôs not a gal-pal, so I‚Äôm not sure what the protocol is. He has a dog, and I was also thinking about maybe just bringing a toy for the pup along with the drinks. 

Also, if there are any ladies in here, what the heck are we wearing to a dinner at his place?? I‚Äôd love to change into a comfy outfit before I drive over if that‚Äôs acceptable‚Ä¶",Just ski mask +coconut oil is fine

Later the night one girl(19F) who‚Äôs a friend of a friend I made in the festival came by. We danced and had conversation (as a group) and she asked for my number, my insta and told me she would show me the ropes around here. I told her that ‚Äúyou probably won‚Äôt even remember this promise don‚Äôt worry‚Äù.

After that day she was like ‚Äúhey see I remembered, wanna hang out Tuesday‚Äù and I was like ‚Äúok‚Äù.

But the thing is she sat on the lap of the common friend and generally was nice to everyone. On top of that when I asked the guy how did they met he said ‚Äúin a random bar‚Äù so idk if this is her normal behavior and not just for ppl she‚Äôs interested in.

Today we talked again about where and when should we meet and she said that ‚Äúwe could grab a coffee at X place Y time‚Äù.

But that wasn‚Äôt what we agreed on she was supposed to show me around not a coffee date. Maybe she doesn‚Äôt care about the event that much and simply doing this because she promised it and doesn‚Äôt even remember what she promised.

Besides, I‚Äôm willing to bet that the cousin would want to pay for themselves. That or your boyfriend pays bc it‚Äôs their cousin. Bringing up who‚Äôs supposed to pay just seems like make something out of nothing.

And I get the idea of the rule but it doesn‚Äôt have to be tic for tac all the time, otherwise it creates this transactional dynamic of one feeling like they ‚Äúowe‚Äù the other bc they did X for them."

dating,147u0i9,2023-06-12 18:29:16,Am I being Love bombed?,"
TL;DR Recently began dating someone and having a hard time differentiating love bombing and genuine interest due to past relationships. Do you think I‚Äôm being love bombed?


3 years ago Chris (27M) followed me (26F) on instagram, we had a few conversations which quickly fizzled out and we hadn‚Äôt spoken since until he slid into my DMs 5 weeks ago making general conversation. I told him he shouldn‚Äôt message me as I assumed he has a girlfriend due to pictures of him with a woman on his profile. He told me he broke up with her 3 months ago and hadn‚Äôt thought to delete them. I didn‚Äôt believe him so didn‚Äôt reply, but the next day he messaged me again, the pictures were gone and they had both unfollowed each other too. We messaged a bit more before he asked me to go for a drink with him a few days later. 

I finally agreed to meet him after a friend‚Äôs party. He was sober, and I was pretty drunk so we went for one drink and he then dropped me home. Due to the fact I was drunk, and that I brought my dog along (who was not very well behaved), I doubt I made a good impression but he seemed keen to see me again. 

We went for dinner a week later at the restaurant his brother owns, and he picked me up beforehand, giving me beautiful flowers and treats for my dog. He was very gentlemanly all night and paid for dinner, refusing my offer to split the bill, and dropped me home without attempting to make a move or come inside. 

3rd date was to the movies a few days later, which I insisted on paying for, and kissed for the first time. 

4th date we went on a dog walk, 5th we went to crazy golf, 6th was to a comedy show, 7th date we went to a pub and then back to mine when we had sex for the first time. On our 8th date I invited him to my house and cooked him dinner, he brought me flowers again saying it was because it was exactly a month since we‚Äôd met for the first time and thanking me for a lovely month. He‚Äôs also taking me to dinner next weekend. 

Chris calls me a couple of times most days, when we have quiet times at work. He also usually calls before bed, and as we have so much to talk about we sometimes end up on the phone for hours. 

Today he told me he cringes saying it but that he thinks about me all the time, and I feel the same. 

I know all of this sounds lovely, and I am really enjoying myself. It feels very natural, we laugh a lot, and have quite a few common interests. The problem is I‚Äôve been in situations in the past where men I‚Äôm dating make a huge amount of effort in the beginning, manage to lure me in, and then drop me once they have achieved whatever goal they had. 

Something that adds to my suspicions is the fact that Chris is objectively very attractive, has been on a reality TV show, and has 10s of thousands of followers on social media. I‚Äôve since realised that he pays for followers and likes on his pictures and buys fake designer clothes. None of these things bother me, but I can‚Äôt decide whether they are a potential indicator of narcissism, or just insecurity?

I‚Äôd really like to know your thoughts as I‚Äôm struggling to think objectively. Is this the honeymoon phase or am I being Love bombed?","What is his job? Is it something that would benefit from an active social media presence? If so then the IG stuff could just be an effort to advance that aspect of his life. You‚Äôve already slept together, which is usually the goal before being dropped by those looking for a hookup, but he‚Äôs still around.  I‚Äôd talk to him, ask him what his intentions with dating are, if he sees this as a long term thing, and go from there."

dating,147tr32,2023-06-12 18:17:57,I could use some perspective on my situationship,"The guy I am seeing: We have been on 5 dates now. Dates 3 and 4 included having sex. Date 5 was just a nice time out, and we talked for a long time.

We text a little just about every day for going on 3 months now. I am leaving the area to go study in about 2 months, but I‚Äôve really started to like him. He‚Äôs kind, and attractive, and I like being around him. He is, so far, the type of person I could see being in an actual relationship with. 

I originally told him I was looking for casual, and at this point I don‚Äôt know how things could work with me moving. I said this the first time we met up. 

His life is kind of up in the air right now, as he is leaving his job and starting something new, but on the first date he had said he could be open to something more serious at this point in his life.

Would it be stupid to tell him I have feelings now? Is that just needlessly ruining a nice casual thing? Guys, would you want to know about how my interest has changed if I didn‚Äôt know how to make something work out? He‚Äôs talked about his desire to have kids, how he wants to have a farm, etc, but I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm reading too much into him talking about these things.

The thing is, I will be going back to my home state for the next three years, and I want to have kids by the end of the three years. I‚Äôm ok with starting that journey on my own, but ideally I would have a romantic partner. I had planned to start dating more seriously when I returned.",just keep it casual at this point. You will be out of the area so why limit yourself and him to a LDR? Life changes when you move away. When you return you can always try again if the opportunity is there.
dating,147tpr1,2023-06-12 18:16:22,I hate Facebook dating,"Everytime I match with someone in Facebook dating it‚Äôll be a really cute girl and it‚Äôll be a real account but what‚Äôs the point of matching if it goes no where?

Goes no where then I see their Instagram profiles and tbh I sometimes feel like I‚Äôll be used just to earn an extra follow. I‚Äôm sorry I sound petty and I know I shouldn‚Äôt rely on these apps but honestly what‚Äôs the point?","Sadly, this happens more frequently in today's dating scene.... not only for men, but women also. I am a 24 y/o female and after having a Tinder profile for 2 years I've decided to delete it for good, nothing positive comes from it. I am more-so interested in stumbling upon something genuine and real throughout my day-to-day activity. That means putting yourself into groups/activities that interest you and connecting with people that have some of the same passion as you do.

dating,147tocr,2023-06-12 18:14:41,Blocked after first date,"So I matched with this girl on Tinder about a week ago. I had a lot of matches but she stood out the most because she seemed very into me and always responded back quick. I never noticed any red flags in her. She was very nice and always complimented me. We eventually exchanged numbers after and started texting from there. She eventually suggested we meet up and hangout this past Saturday. I never felt like hanging out because we only knew each other for about 2 days or so. She eventually convinced me to meet at this restaurant and we did. We met up and hugged each other. We ordered food and sat down. I paid for the whole thing being the gentleman I am. Had great conversations and made eye contact the whole time and it felt like we were both into each other. We talked about our personal lives, made jokes, laughed, etc. After about an hour, we both decided to start heading home. We hugged again and went our own ways. She told me to text her when I get home and I eventually did. And that was it, never heard from her again. She blocked me on Tinder and my number. I am still in shock from this whole situation. I would never imagine someone like her being childish and blocking me with no explanation. I never want to get attached to a girl I‚Äôm not dating but this one hurts a bit. My best advice to all of you is never get too excited on the first date. Advice and support is appreciated!","I‚Äôm not saying a date needs to be 6 hours, but a 1 hour date isn‚Äôt really anything. If anything, it was a telltale sign that she wasn‚Äôt interested.

dating,147tkpi,2023-06-12 18:10:10,What piece of advice would you give the younger you about dating?,"Pretty much the title. If you could give the younger you advice on dating what would you say?

For me, the three pieces of advice that I'd tell the younger me is:

1. Don't put too much into the talking phase 
2. Don't let yourself get in the way of talking to someone new
3. Don't overthink everything

In the past, I'd put way too much into the talking phase and would be really disappointed when things didn't work out. I think in my mind I figured that if someone is giving me their number and then continues to talk to me, then they must like me and be interested in going on a date. Obviously, this is not the case. The other thing as well is I used to get in the way of myself from talking to girls that I thought were cute. In college, I used to overthink things and think that if I approached someone they'd think I'm being creepy. After a while, I came to the realization that I was really getting in the way of myself meeting new people because I was overthinking everything in my mind. My new motto is just shut off your brain and don't think. What I mean by this, is just treat the conversation as if you're talking to any other person. Don't treat it differently because it's someone that you want to ask out or get their number or whatever the case may be.","If someone is consistently giving mixed signals, and refusing to discuss it- don‚Äôt stick around waiting for them to make up their mind- just GTFO."

I've tried dating apps, but I'll match with like 1 or 2 people a week and I just get left on delivered.  I don't go out in public much, but to me it seems I have a better chance just going to a stranger and striking up a convo than trying on a dating app.  Is there any suggestions of what I can do to find me a lover?","Went to check your profile to see, if it might be your personality.

dating,147thax,2023-06-12 18:05:48,Break up with my boyfriend of a year and a half,"I want to know if I‚Äôm in the wrong, or at the very least whether my feelings are valid. My ex boyfriend and I dated for a year and a half, he was my first pretty much everything. For the last three or so years I‚Äôve been dealing with some form of depression and anxiety. My anxiety has been constant but my suicidal thoughts come and go in periods. My boyfriend was aware of my anxiety, and over the last few months I started to feel suicidal again. I didn‚Äôt want to express this to my boyfriend because I didn‚Äôt want to put that on him, especially because our weekly visits were a lot of what was keeping me going. With that said, I‚Äôve been a lot more emotional, and I found myself getting more upset over small things I normally wouldn‚Äôt. Last Monday I decided that I should tell him about the thoughts I‚Äôd been having because I thought it might help him understand why I had been so emotional. I didn‚Äôt go into too many details but I thought it was important he knew. The next day, we fought again, he said some things that upset me, overall, he ended up decided that we should break up. Prom was a week away, I have exams this week, and I graduate soon. I didn‚Äôt want him to feel stuck in the relationship but he could not have chosen a worse time. It took me a year and a half of us being together to feel comfortable to tell him about my suicidal thoughts (past and present) and literally a day later he broke up with me. With everything else on top of things. 
On top of all that, and this is dumbest part, which is why it‚Äôs last, all throughout our relationship he would never respond to my messages on Instagram because he didn‚Äôt like Instagram, now he‚Äôs online all the time. I sent him a message asking why he was on Instagram all of a sudden and he asked why I was monitoring he social media use. Instagram tells you when other people are online, it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm looking, I probably shouldn‚Äôt have messaged him about it, but it upset me, why the sudden change??
Overall I‚Äôm just upset. There are so many other things I‚Äôm upset about for this situation, I just needed to vent I guess.",

When I was 17 for like a month but that‚Äôs it. The issue is that anytime I‚Äôm interested in people at a certain point this fear just starts creeping in. I start disliking the situation and want to run away.
Last week I met this guy and we‚Äôve been writing ever since. I was very excited cuz we‚Äôve quickly discussed we both had an interest in each other. Until today I was very confident and happy but now suddenly I want to run away again. I‚Äôm so afraid of meeting him again and negative feelings creeping up. Or that he‚Äôs different from what I remember and that I‚Äôve built myself some fantasy world. I‚Äôve decided I‚Äôm gonna pull thru, but I really don‚Äôt know how to deal with this emotionally. 
I also don‚Äôt know if this is me liking him or just being excited about someone being interested in me. I can‚Äôt stop overthinking. 
I used to have pretty bad depression, my parents were a bit emotionally abusive. Relationships are one of my three worst fears. But I want to, I mean I did like him when we met and I like talking to him. 
It‚Äôs driving me mad, this happens anytime I start romantically liking anyone even a bit.

dating,147tdjs,2023-06-12 18:01:25,Fourth date advice,"Hello all, hope this is allowed and I‚Äôm using a throwaway account for a few reasons.
Against the odds, I‚Äôve bagged a fourth date - this is despite her saying she‚Äôs not ready for more than friends right now/isn‚Äôt sure if she‚Äôs ready to open up to someone just yet (unsure of what happened in the past relationship).
I‚Äôm not sure how much of an actual ‚Äúdate‚Äù this will be as it‚Äôs more ‚Äúhanging out‚Äù on an evening after work. Of course rather than just going for a walk or sitting down, which we‚Äôve already done - I‚Äôd like to make it something a bit more fun and memorable. Keeping it lighthearted and fun seems to be more likely what‚Äôs going to give that push ahead (I hope, anyway). I was thinking of something like bowling, going to the arcade or maybe even just a couple of games of pool.
Personally I‚Äôm thinking maybe the arcade or bowling would be a bit more fun as it gives a bit more of a chance for some physical contact and keeping things flirty and competitive in a fun way rather than a serious manner.
If it‚Äôs of any use, we already have kissed but nothing more.

dating,147t7dd,2023-06-12 17:54:18,FWB F20 is confusing me F19,"Hi. My friends with benefits and I have been seeing each other for 4 months now. At the start she said she didn‚Äôt want anything more than a fwbs cuz she wanted to explore and cuz she wasn‚Äôt over her ex. I agreed to this even though I was looking for a relationship. One day I was telling her how I‚Äôm sad that no one has romantic feelings for me  and she said she would like me but she had already decided we were fwbs. A few months ago also she told me she likes me but doesn‚Äôt want to be with me. It‚Äôs been amazing it‚Äôs been so so much fun!
More fun than I‚Äôve ever had in a relationship. However now we have a weird dynamic and my therapist claims we are in a relationship but she (my fwb) just doesn‚Äôt know it. I don‚Äôt know what we are and really need advice on how to take this forward. Basically she and I have turned into the best of friends (with benefits). We text all day long and see each other 4-6 times a week. If I don‚Äôt respond to her text for a day she‚Äôll text me again or send me something that reminds her of me. She has introduced me to all her friends and knows all my friends and makes and effort and wants them to like her. Whenever we‚Äôre in public dancing etc she grinds on me and sometimes kisses me. We were apart for a month cuz I was travelling and the day I got back she took a day off of work to see me (she said she‚Äôs just tired and all her friends are home so she wants me over. These are kind of like mixed signals to me. 
I used to think I really like her and I do but I don‚Äôt know if I see a future with her (like marriage and kids I know I‚Äôm young but still) maybe just cause she doesn‚Äôt want one with me. I am just really confused cuz she keeps reiterating we are just fwbs but we can‚Äôt go a day without interaction which doesn‚Äôt even happen w my best friend.
I‚Äôm scared this will hurt but I‚Äôm having the time of my life. Any advice?","If she says your not dating then it‚Äôs purely sexual

Walk away from it and see what happens. 


The reality is you can‚Äôt force someone to say you are dating

It doesn‚Äôt matter what we or your therapists thinks

Because if the person says you aren‚Äôt an item your not an item. 



If you want advice then here‚Äôs the reality she likely doesn‚Äôt want to date date. Friends talk all the time and she uses you for sex. 

You can lie and tell her some other girl asked you out on a date and see what she thinks. 

Maybe she supports it. And boom you fucking know she doesn‚Äôt want you as a life partner

Or 2 she will not like it and you can respond with that it sure as hell feels like you 2 are dating and that your looking for a life partner and not a Fwb and will need to end the benefits part.

dating,147t66n,2023-06-12 17:52:51,24F Feeling Hopeless...,"Here's the situation: I'm a 24F and have never dated anyone in my life. Before the pandemic, I used to have several people interested in me, but for some reason, it never worked out. However, ever since COVID hit, it feels like my romantic life has come to a complete standstill. Guys are no longer approaching me, zero dates, and even my DMs have gone silent.  
  
Most of my friends, both girls and boys, often compliment me on being the ""prettiest"" in our group, so I don't think I'm terribly unattractive. About my personality, I'm quite responsible. I don't like to party, I don't drink, I'm the stereotype of a ""good girl"", that wants a long-lasting relationship. But I guess that's too much to ask.   
  
I've never tried dating apps before, but I'm considering giving them a shot, (even though I would prefer to meet people organically, but I hate clubs). I just want to meet new people and see where that takes me.   
  
I'm wondering if any of you have had similar experiences or advice to share. Should I take the plunge into the world of dating apps? Or what can I do to meet people more organically?","Dating apps are amazing if you use them right. The biggest mistake I see people making on dating apps is tying their emotions to someone before it‚Äôs warranted. 
Talk to people, go out, and have fun. Keep expectations reasonable. A date is just two people committed to having a good time and getting to know each other. If things fizzle out with someone, don‚Äôt get discouraged. Just move on to the next until you have found someone right for you."
dating,147t65a,2023-06-12 17:52:48,How to not immediately fall for someone?,"I‚Äôm (27M) planning on stepping back into dating again; but I am concerned for myself that I‚Äôll just ‚Äúfall‚Äù for the first girl I‚Äôm attracted to that shows interest in me.

For reference, I‚Äôve been single for a while, very lonely and have self esteem issues despite being attractive and fit (according to others) with a strong career, fun hobbies and an outgoing personality.

What‚Äôs the safest way to proceed? I don‚Äôt want to be hurt or taken advantage of again.","Honestly?  Therapy to work on your self esteem issues.  Going into a relationship (or even just dating) with a poor self image creates a LOT of problems that don‚Äôt just magically go away when you get a partner.  I‚Äôm not saying you should be a smug, arrogant asshole, but you should be able to look at yourself as a whole and GENERALLY like who you are.  My ex husband was very insecure - and really didn‚Äôt like himself - when we started dating.  He was just as insecure when we got married, and still didn‚Äôt like himself (no matter how much I tried to build him up).  His insecurity drove behaviors that ultimately destroyed our marriage.  Even after we got divorced, he still didn‚Äôt do any work on his self esteem (and honestly, probably had a worse opinion of himself because his wife left).  He managed to get remarried about a year ago, but he hasn‚Äôt made any changes, so that marriage is already falling apart.  Improving your self esteem isn‚Äôt a guarantee that you won‚Äôt ever get hurt again, but you‚Äôll be much better equipped to deal with it if it does, and you‚Äôre FAR more likely to attract healthy partners which reduces your risk of getting hurt."
dating,147t4pe,2023-06-12 17:51:03,How to approach at the gym as a woman.,"I know I know, if men get scolded for approaching women then it should be the same for us. However, I do not agree with the whole concept of the gym isn't somewhere where you can meet a partner.

I am a 25F and there is someone at my gym that I am interested in. I haven't approached because yes, I am scared of rejection, but I am also very scared of the person saying they are younger than me. I know it may seem like a weird fear to have, but I guess I would just feel like a creep if they were younger and I would want to crawl in a hole. 

To describe myself, I consider myself pretty attractive and have been told so for pretty much my whole life. I have never been rejected, but I have only gotten back into dating this year, and its weird for me. I suppose that is why it is anxiety provoking for me. 

Thank you for reading and any advice!","Well you can try to be discrete, try to do it when others cant listen in. If he doesn't have friends in that gym then you don't need to be ashamed of embarrassing yourself to much.   I can understand your anxiety of being out of dating game, and that is why you need to push yourself or you will never take the first step.  
Even if he rejects you I applaud you for taking the initiative."

But is this true and what I mean by around a lot girls attracted, say for instance he‚Äôs very popular with girls in their friendship groups any women weigh in on this? 
Do you get attracted to guys who have a lot of success with women just because they have a lot of success?

dating,147sv60,2023-06-12 17:39:35,Did I blow my (23M) chance with my cousins (26F) friend ?,"So last night I (23/M) went out to a bar with my cousin (26/F) and her friends. I go out with them occasionally for birthdays or other events but I rarely interact with her friends. 

My cousin has a friend, Megan, who she‚Äôs been friends with for basically her whole life and even my family knows who Megan is. I see her every once in awhile and last time I saw her was a year ago when she was dating some guy. 

At the bar last night we were all in a little circle and dancing and singing to the music. Probably about 6-8 of us. Megan started dancing with me and grabbing my hands while we danced and sang to different songs. I didn‚Äôt think anything of it but then eventually she asked if I wanted to get a drink at the bar and I said yes so she grabbed my hand and lead me through a crowd and to the bar and bought us a shot and beer. And then she did the same thing with my hand after we got our drinks and walked back to where everyone was. And then later we got another drink on me so I grabbed her hand and lead her to the bar and back to our circle. 

I was pretty drunk and I didn‚Äôt go into the night planning to make a move on her but after telling my friends about her grabbing my hand and stuff they said I blew my shot. I feel like an idiot now lol because I totally would have kissed her. I wasn‚Äôt sure if she was just being nice to me since she‚Äôs a good person or just trying to have fun .


TL;DR: my cousins (26/F) friend grabbed my hands to dance and to lead me (23/M) to the bar last night and I‚Äôm not sure if she was interested in me. My friend said I blew my chance. But I am unsure if grabbing my hands and dancing with me meant anything.",Nah I don‚Äôt think you blew your shot but you didn‚Äôt do yourself any favors for sure. She probably wanted you to make a move and you didn‚Äôt. Best thing to do is talk to her about last night

We had issues because I‚Äôm tied into some people who are involved with gangs. I‚Äôve never broken the law, but she‚Äôs uncomfortable. Anyways, while we broke up briefly, she told me when we got back together that she‚Äôs bi and almost went on a date with a girl. Later, she admitted that girl was our friend, Danielle, was that girl. Danielle was dating another guy, Pharrell, so I didn‚Äôt care. They broke up and Danny had to move out, we let her move in with us. Danny floated the idea of a threesome half jokingly, but she was pretty much serious. Me and Lauren, my gf, backed away, but she lives with us still. Anyways, Lauren agreed on our behalf one day to have a poly relationship with Danny. I was fine because Danny was hot, but it was weird she didn‚Äôt talk to me. We were poly until recently. I lost my job after failing a drug test, shortly after, Lauren got a big promotion and now makes like $65k. Danny makes almost 200k in a corporate role, now Danny has said she only wants to date Lauren & won‚Äôt continue being poly. Lauren agreed with Danny and has said she wants me to move out. Danny was sneaky because she knew I was going to propose to Lauren and said not to until I found another job. She knew all along that she wanted to push me out. She gave the ultimatum 4 days later. I can‚Äôt be kicked out because I‚Äôm on the lease and Danny isn‚Äôt, but maybe I should cut my losses. Thoughts?","Either kick Danny out and deal with the BS of staying with your ex or move out.  


Notice how I called her your ex. You two are done and have been done since the 1st time you split. You don't make your relationship poly without consulting your partner about it. That's pretty much cheating."

I know looks are such surface level things, but I can‚Äôt seem to stop the thoughts since they are intrusive, it‚Äôs unbelievably debilitating and I can‚Äôt meet new people because of it. Maybe it‚Äôs just something that will go away after I have that first breakthrough connection with someone new?

dating,147sbfs,2023-06-12 17:16:03,Girlfriend gift unappreciated,"BF (23) here.

I gave my GF (23) a new iPhone 14 for her birthday. Her reaction to the gift was unexpected. Maybe I‚Äôm expecting too much. 

I surprised her in a very creative elaborative way. She wasn‚Äôt shocked. She wasn‚Äôt overly grateful. She just said thank you after I asked her a few times on her thoughts on it. I‚Äôve tried gifting her one in the past because her phone is very old and refurbished. She always makes a fit and stops me (in a cute way). In this scenario, I got none of that reaction. 

In fact I gifted it to her after picking her up from the train station and I got little to no reaction. I made an elaborate plan. I‚Äôd pick her up from the train. Her brother using the IMEI number would activate the phone and I‚Äôd call her #. Her new phone would ring instead of the old one. She just wasn‚Äôt moved by it. It didn‚Äôt phase her. No reaction at all. 

I‚Äôm hurt for two reasons. It was expensive and I expected more from her. Two, my family were all supportive of this gift and asked me about her reaction. I lied to them to make my gf look good and said she was shocked, astonished etc when In reality, her feelings towards it were subpar.


We are less than 1 year In and I‚Äôve given her other things. Her parents visited her at her apartment the other day and they asked about those new gadgets IE tv, computer + hardware. She lied to them and said she bought it even though she‚Äôs a student (can‚Äôt afford it) instead of saying I bought it. 

Am I missing anything? I‚Äôm just really disappointed and upset.

I kindly request everyone to be respectful and address my concern/give advice. Don‚Äôt jump to conclusions or make assumptions. Just ask me if anything.","> I‚Äôve tried gifting her one in the past because her phone is very old and refurbished. She always makes a fit and stops me (in a cute way).

I just feel very self-conscious and like people in my major city are looking for people on the same level as them. He knows what I do and seems to not care but I worry as it develops into something more serious this is gonna hurt me. Love does not conquer all IMO.

Biggest thing other than being taken advantage of, is that you undoubtedly come off looking like a pushover.  Women don't want pushover men.  They want men who are strong and secure.  They will test that in subtle (and not so subtle ways).  You're failing these tests.

Either way, I'm not buying her anything.  That said, I do pay for all dates.  But if a girl starts asking me to buy her things, say a snow cone from a street vendor, I probably won't unless the date is going really well.

After a break up I intend to go back dating and see what comes out of it: Now I would like to have some perspective on the living situation I'm in:

I live in a quite big house (3 floors) together with two other people around my age all with normal jobs: We have each our room(s) and a big shared living room, Kitchen, Garden (with chickens), basement with much storage and a little gym, so generally a lot of place. When I moved new to the City (Central Europe) I didn't know many people and being a very social person  I decided not to go live on my own, but join this house. I like it as the people are great and we sometimes do stuff together but everyone also lives their own life and sometimes one is alone for 1-2 weeks.

Now when it comes to dating it leaves me a little insecure what people think about this ""living model"". I know it is more known while studying somewhere to have shared flats and not  normal around my age. Would you consider it a bummer or something interesting? WOuld you have concerns about privacy while dating?

I'm sure there's not timeline, but it should happens eventually.","I have not been in many relationships. But I was happily married for over 25 years. I feel like when I realized that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her, that's when she became the most important person in my world. As we advanced toward marriage, that idea solidified. I am now in a relationship after living as a widower for about 5 years. I'm not sure if she is the most important person in my world, but my world is somewhat small and she's fairly important to me."
dating,147rum9,2023-06-12 16:56:42,Why is dating so much harder after quitting alcohol?,"I quit alcohol a few years ago because I had a drinking problem and have noticed huge benefits in my life, except in one area: dating. It seems like many girls I meet in person or through dating apps find me boring for not drinking. I‚Äôm still a huge stoner, but there aren‚Äôt that many girls out there who use cannabis and don‚Äôt drink alcohol. And those girls who don‚Äôt drink are usually not very accepting of cannabis either. Furthermore, those women who do smoke weed don‚Äôt really like doing it as a first date and prefer to go grab a drink. And going out to bars makes me feel out of place because everyone else is drunk and I‚Äôm not. It used to be way easier for me to talk to girls at bars when I was drunk, but it seems like picking up girls outside of bars is also harder now for some reason.

Ladies: is it true that y‚Äôall would prefer a man who is willing to have a glass of wine with you, or does it not really matter if one is sober? Any dating advice for someone who is sober from alcohol but still smokes a lot of weed?","I‚Äôm a girl and I don‚Äôt drink as well. Never touched alcohol, and people also find me boring and keep pushing me to do it. 
So for me, I would never judge or turn down someone for not drinking, the same way I don‚Äôt judge anyone who does. We all have our choices and people should be able to respect that. If they don‚Äôt, they are not the right person for you. 
Not much of an advice here, but I just want to say that you don‚Äôt need to drink to fit in. I‚Äôm sure you will find someone who thinks that‚Äôs unique."

She said yes to a date, but I don‚Äôt want to come off too strong because she‚Äôs probably still a bit upset with me, what to do?",Y‚Äôall broke up 10 days ago and 8 days later you asked her out and she agreed? Either she‚Äôs looking for some closure or it wasn‚Äôt really a break up. Either way this just seems like a mess.
dating,147rk8h,2023-06-12 16:45:02,Told by my dad that I'm an unpleasant person.,"I've been repeatedly told by my dad that I'm an unpleasant person because I'm confrontational and argumentative, and that I'm not a wonderful person.  But he's also told me that I'm kindhearted.

Being told that I'm unpleasant makes me feel like I'm not worthy of having friends or a romantic relationship, because people will come to disrespect me in time and not want to be around me.  My dad is the only person in my life who's told me many times that I'm unpleasant and annoying.  I have a history of being called names by him, and him talking down to me and mocking me.

I still live with my dad.  I am twenty-nine years old.

Being told I'm unpleasant has made me question my worth and think that I don't deserve friends or a romantic partner.  That I can be nice, but that maybe that's a facade for the bad person I actually am.  I don't know how I ought to take my dad's statement, but he's often told me sarcastically that ""I'm a wonderful person"" and that I'm ""great"".  It makes me think that maybe I'm actually a piece of shit.

Thoughts?","Maybe you're dad's just a dick?

That said, being told you're confrontational and argumentative aren't hard knocks - that sounds like constructive criticism.  You will have trouble getting friends and maintaining relationships being that way.  Not unworthy per say, but it's a hard way of going about it.

Another thing is that you're 29 and still live at home.  Maybe his emotional abuse has held you back, but whatever the reason you're still there, you need to figure shit out and get out.  You should be on your own at 29."

He‚Äôs told me before that when he was single he would go to strip clubs a lot, mostly to take customers from his work, but also if he was on a family trip to Florida he would go by himself. As far as I know he never went to any when he would be in a relationship and definitely hasn‚Äôt been to one since we‚Äôve been together and says he ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt want to anymore.‚Äù I have nothing against strip clubs or strippers in general but I‚Äôm just wondering if this is kind of a red flag that i need to watch out for in the future? Or that the fact that he did this in the past means he could cheat/want to do this if we‚Äôre still together? Any men who are ex-strip club fanatics in relationships wanna chime in too?? lol

Then that night he asked me for my Instagram and I gave it to him and when we added each other he had a super cringe username. I was a little irked but I let it go. Then I saw his photos and they were quite different and I saw he wore a lot of fake luxury brands. I felt like I was misled a little and eventually blocked him so that he can‚Äôt contact me. I feel bad and I‚Äôm overthinking this a lot. I felt like running away. 
Am I just scared of love? Or like is it okay to feel this way? Also we just talked for like a day so I‚Äôm just overthinking this right?",Yeah that was an extreme response on your part.
dating,147rggu,2023-06-12 16:40:39,Lonely confused who get to discuss for the first time,"29M never had a girlfriend sound weird yes i know, in fact i've been working remote since covid in 2020 ,never had the opportunity to meet new friends ,not onto dating apps ,most of my friends left the country so i didn't develop new connectons,also never had the gut to approach to girls (lack of confidence) .

Lately my work organized an event where we are all gathered all remote employees (strategy of the company in my country to work remote) ,it's been a gathering and work together in an hotel ,in the night we went all to a restaurant where i had the opportunity to talk to many coworkers especially to a girl where we spent almost an hour talking to her it was fun she was open during our talk and smiling, playing with her hair .I kept the discussion in work topics and i enjoyed a lot .

after the gathering in the restaurant it's organized also that we go to a club next to the restaurant and it wasn't in my plan to go with them until that discussion ,so i decided to go because of her of course .  
in the club we sit together talked a bit not too much since it's noisy had the opportunity to dance with whole group of coworkers.

When we decided to leave all i proposed to ride her to the hotel since i go back to the house, in our way back I got her phone number(whatsapp) left her in the hotel entrance and she told me to text her my arriving to the house .  
by tomorrow in the hotel i talked to her not too much but with the colleagues and by the end of the event i talked to her and told her let's keep on touch ,and then the farewell

After two days I texted her few messages asking about her and telling that I enjoyed the all gathering ,the discussion and getting to know her and she texted the same and that was yesterday.

I don't know , should I ask her for a date to get to know each other more?, telling her that I'm onto her? ,should I tall her that I like her ?sooner this week or keep the discussion virtually but she's not responding by long texts.

Thanks.","I recommend working hard at building consistent friendships in your life because it‚Äôs so healthy for us as humans. We live in an individualistic society and it‚Äôs destroying people‚Äôs mental health and heightening loneliness. This will also help you meet more women, see what you like, and also have a community to support you as you walk through the ups and downs of dating.

As to this girl, yeah ask her out! Just make it simple like a coffee date or walk. Enjoy getting to know her. You don‚Äôt have to like her and keep seeing her either! I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôll enjoy getting to know you better too and if she shuts you down, that has to do with her and it‚Äôs worth continuing to ask women you‚Äôre interested out."

We have both tried to move on from that moment to April of 2023.
Since May she reached out via text,We been small talk texting with each other,We then both agreed to hang out and do things together.

Do we think it‚Äôs just to ex partners who like each other‚Äôs company to fill the boredom? 
She‚Äôs openly admitted she‚Äôs set in her ways and said she‚Äôs not interested in the dating scene.","Only you know the answer to that. You can keep hanging out with her and see what happens.

dating,147reow,2023-06-12 16:38:36,ghosted after 4 dates,"so I (24f) started speaking to this guy (24m) about a month ago. we started off messaging a fair bit, a least a few messages everyday, and met up 4 times - these involved going for a drink, going for a drive or coming over to play video games (nothing intimate happened apart from cuddling on the last date). Everytime we met we connected so well, we would be talking and laughing for hours, I really had hope that this person might be 'different', we had lots of common goals like he wanted a relationship and eventually marriage, and we seemed to be able to communicate our issues well . For example, When he goes out with friends he could not message me for 24 hours, and one week he barely messaged me at all, to then be very apologetic and I explained that I found this triggering and explained my rejection/ abandonment issues and he really seemed to understand and we had an in depth conversation about communication and our issue's etc and it seemed to be solved. I should also mention this guy hates social media and texting so I tried to understand this as to why he not message as frequently. Anyway, fast forward to the day after we last met up, I had a lovely time and he said he did too - he even initiated making plans to meet up on the weekend. 

We messaged after the meet up and I found his messages to be slightly off with me and had long reply times, but I knew he was burnt out with work and didn't want my own insecurities to ruin anything so i didn't press anything. I messaged about the weekend plans and he just said ""okay sweet i'll let you know."" I took this to mean it was no longer a definite plan (even though it was discussed and agreed apon when we last met up). I replied quite bluntly in a way he would know I was upset (I regret this now and should've just asked if the weekend was still happening). He then replied 24 hours later confused as to why I was being blunt and said I could tell him if i was upset etc. I then explained that I reacted like that because I wasn't sure if the weekend plans were happening and I felt he was being off with me, but I was probably just overthinking it.

Another 24 hours goes by and he then replies saying it was a misunderstanding and he thought i didnt want him to come see me on the weekend, and that why this is why he hates texting all the time as it always gets misconstrued. I replied saying it was a big miscommunication mixed with my own insecurities and i do want to see him and that i know he is going through stuff (burnt out from work) and that i hope he is okay. That message has been left on delivered for 4 days. I'm travelling around a lot for uni and work at the moment so i'm only in the same city as him for part of the week, so I sent him a text this morning saying I was here til weds and to let me know if he wanted to go for a drive or anything, and that I hope he is okay (to no response). Since I have not heard from him in 4 days, despite him being active on his phone and him knowing I would be very affected by being ghosted, I‚Äôm starting to think this is the case :(",yeah hes probably ghosting you which sucks. Best to keep yourself occupied and/or date other dudes.
dating,147r9nt,2023-06-12 16:32:52,Confused after first one-night stand (M22 F22 ),"So 2 days ago, I had my first one-night stand ever. I had some sexual experience before, but not a lot, and it was a few years in the past.I meet the girl in a climbing gym in my city, we started talking. (She is from North America, and I am from Europe). The vibe was good. I invited her to show her some more locally known spots that are unusual for tourists to see. We went out for a drink and then landed at my place. So I also have to mention that I wasn‚Äòt extremely attracted to here instantly. I found here cute but nothing more. And it wasn‚Äòt my intention to have sex, I just wanted to get to know here. Long story short, we had pretty wild sex. Btw. in a Shared Apartment with very thin doors. She left very early in the morning. I really enjoyed the night with here, but at first there was nothing more than that. On the next day, she wrote me on three separate occasions. And we started texting I little bit more. For me, it seems that she really likes me and even tough she lives on the other side of the planet really wants to meet me again. Later, she even asked me if we want to travel together in Summer. Overall, I‚Äôm very overwhelmed with what I should do with the situation. I did only know her for a few hours, so it‚Äòs hard for me to even say if we are a good match. And just inviting here to travel with me together in summer seems kind of crazy. But I have to state that my feelings are really mixed up currently, and maybe I also have a little bit of a crush on her.  
",Stop making it so complicated. You obviously like her...so see if she is up for hanging out again?

I also like compliments on my eyes, body affirming compliments (like he likes the parts that I'm insecure about), and compliments on specific details on my personality. Do you guys like being called handsome or fine or hot more? What makes you feel butterflies more than the others? I want to be able to compliment men that I like with words that make them feel good. I also want to know what kind of compliments you all value more, compliments on your appearance, compliments on personality, compliments on the things you do for us. Yeah","The best thing a woman can tell a man, especially if they are married or have a family is ""I'm proud of you"".

In the past, I‚Äôve occasionally swiped and gone out with men who asked me out that I was interested in, and for some reason, that was always pretty successful but I was also in a different city.

I‚Äôve been expanding outside my physical type because I‚Äôm open and trying to figure out what I want. 

Lately it seems like I‚Äôve gone on a streak of REALLY bad dates which has never happened to me before. One was drinks and lasted under an hour, horrible conversationalist and took off without walking me home and never texted at all. Second proposed a last minute drinking date on a Friday which I should have declined but we ended up messing around. I actually liked him enough that I asked if we could try again more soberly and he said we didn‚Äôt have a ‚Äúromantic connection‚Äù. Third I knew within 5 minutes that physical attraction was not there but could tell he was into me (leg touching, asked for a kiss and I said no). Afterwards, he texted saying no ‚Äúromantic connection‚Äù but proposed a casual hookup/relationship. Wtf??

I‚Äôm trying to put myself out there and go on a date per week but man, does this feel like a waste of time. 

Those of you who are regularly going on dating app dates, how do you avoid burnout? How do you avoid hits to your self esteem from a bad streak of dates (or not take it personally when a bunch of people say you don‚Äôt have a ‚Äúromantic connection‚Äù)?

But on our last date I told her ""yeah people usually can't pronounce my name"" she asked me to pronounce it, I said ""oh it's maling (not my real name)"", and she said ""yeahh... I'm not even gonna try""

For context I'm from south east asia, with a unique name. 

I told her ""it's okay, just call me by my nickname, Mal instead! It's easier to pronounce :)"" but she replied with ""haha how about we just don't call each other by our names and just use 'you' instead"" 

In my culture it's a disrepectful thing to say, but she's american and idk if that's a normal thing to say there??

2. Find common hobbies
3. Find a healthy way to resolve conflict 
4. Accept ur partners flaws and help them
5. Accept your own flaws and ask for help

I've tried so many times but my post keeps getting taken down, I have no idea why. I'll try again anyways.

There's this rlly cute guy who lives in the block across and I have an idea of what his name might be but he seems like he doesn't exist on social media or anywhere online, maybe it's because I misspell his name or something? I know he plays football regularly, hence I saw his name on his tee (twice), but the first was a nickname and the other had his surname but I couldn't really make out the middle letters because it was at night. He plays his music really loud in his car so I know when he arrives, esp because we have the same music taste. I'd love to know more about him before approaching him in case he has a girlfriend and our interaction may seem awkward.

Any ideas on what to do?",Approach him without knowing anything about him. You don't need to know whether he has a girlfriend before you approach him.

Yesterday we met again, we where very close all the time, then just before saying goodbye, she started talking, like that it won't work out and she hzs no time to waste. I agreed with her mostly, and said I will think about it. Then she kisses me intensly and we make out for like 5 minutes.

I really came to like her, and I think she has everything I would want in a women, its really not only physical, she has many personality traits tgat I like. Still my head tells me to call it off. My heart still has hope, though

First Question

Why did she tell me in this way

Does she just want me to end things, insread of her (doesnt make sense, why would she spend so many of her rare free hours with me yesterday, like she was all over me the whole evening

Is this her way of telling me, that I should do something about this (I would, but I really don't see a way to change anything, I made some propositions for spending more time together inciting her to a short trip, but she hadn't time for this)

Did she just want to vent?

I dont get it, from her talking I was immediately like, oh she'll end things with me now, but the she writes me at 3 a. m., i am thinking about what we talked...

Second question

I feel like just writing her a longer text (which I normally don't do, I would just call, but i need a clear head), where I write her how things happened from my perspective, how I feel about the whole situation, what I can and cannot do about it ( i already told her that I don't want to make false promises)
I completely understand her situation, i really cannot blame her.

And that while I can't find the strength right now to tell her we should just end things, my head is telling me that its probably for the best for both of us.

Is this good idea, or m I reading the situation completely wrong...",

She is pretty and more my type plus doesn‚Äôt seem extremely popular or anything like me so it seems pretty perfect for me. 

My issue is I am pretty awkward. Never dated anyone, kissed anyone or even just held hands‚Ä¶yeah I know. I don‚Äôt have any friends that a girls as well so this is a little odd. This one though has been talking to me for about a week and she seems somewhat interested. 

I‚Äôve been just getting to know her by asking questions and casually talking, but eventually I want to try for something more.

How would any of you go about this? I need advice more on how I can keep her interested because I live out of state and she lives in the colleges current state so I wouldn‚Äôt see her till the fall if things work out. If anyone has anything I would really appreciate it!","Since you guys are far, you need to start calling her, trying to talk on the phone is key in this for the next month or two. The next step would have been to take her out on a date but since you are far it‚Äôs gonna be a little difficult to navigate. You don‚Äôt think you can meet her halfway anywhere? I would still be trying to work that out because it‚Äôs the best and somewhat only way you keep her interested is an interaction face to face. But in terms of your inexperience you got to put yourself out and get out your comfort zone, it‚Äôs the only way you‚Äôll learn how to not be awkward. Got to be comfortable with the uncomfortable. Hope this helps"

He had a habit of needing to talk to other women. No self awareness, just said he was ‚Äúcurious‚Äù and just likes to talk to people. That‚Äôs his actual reasoning. 

Such bullshit in my opinion but he insists that‚Äôs all he is. He likes people, he‚Äôs outgoing and curious. He can‚Äôt just admit he needs female attention/narcissistic supply at all times.

dating,147pnw4,2023-06-12 15:23:40,Is it a red flag when you are talking to a guy but he follows and likes way too many girls on ig?,"Is it a red flag when you are talking to a guy but he follows and likes way too many girls on ig? (Both regular girls and models). Like he seems like a good match but I‚Äôm very indecisive about him because of that. Basically his 90% of followings on ig are all girls. I think that there are so many red flags that reflects on guys when they start following and liking every girls pictures on ig. Some of them could be: they tend to sexualize everything (which he hasn‚Äôt yet but doesn‚Äôt mean that he couldn‚Äôt eventually), is embarrassing seeing your man popping up on every girls ig, I think it would be easier for them to cheat, lots of lust, they are probably on every girls dms/ ig reactions and the list goes on. 

Like so far we truly connect deeply but that is holding me back‚Ä¶ and idk what to do because on my previous relationship it cost me later on on not acting based on the red flags that I saw early in the relationship. I need advice!!","Personally, I don't think following a lot of women on social is a red flag in itself. I know guys who follow accounts like that for a surprisingly wide range of reasons beyond the obvious (mostly guys in media or entertainment who actually know the content creators so it's part networking, they work with the photographers, MUAs, or stylists the content creators work with, or they do the type of shoots the content creators typically post). 

Anyway, the red flag would be if I'm not comfortable with how he responds if I tell him that it makes ME uncomfortable. If he lies (says he's not following the accounts he's following, says he'll stop but doesn't) or gets disrespectful (like if he says I'm being dumb or unreasonable by being uncomfortable or says my feelings don't matter or aren't valid) THAT is the red flag for me. 

If he still wants to follow those types of accounts knowing it makes me uncomfortable, that's all I need to know to make the boundaries I need to make for myself. I can't control what he does, but I can control who has access to me and my energy and effort. 

If a guy cares about you, he'll at least consider your feelings and at least make an effort not to hurt you. Hope this helps."
dating,147pnph,2023-06-12 15:23:19,Feeling dating anxiety! What does he mean? I need advice on how to relax.,"Please give me some advice and encouragement. Thanks.

I have been on dating apps for 1 year now. I'm dating to meet my partner and future husband. I'm not looking for flings or hook ups. I have talked to so many dudes and been on so many dates. But quantity does not equal quality as the majority of the guys just want sex or they say they are not sure what they are looking for. So I usually just get only first dates. I have managed to get to 4th dates with only 2 guys because they said they were looking for relationships but I cut them off because they lied and were rushing to sex.

Well,  recently I met another guy and we made it to the second date.  We have been talking alot everyday, we seem to have some chemistry and he says he is looking for his future wife and he says he wants to court me. We have talked about our wants and needs in a relationship too. This is a first for me, out of the 25+ guys I've met this past year he is the only one who seems to be on the same page as me.

Now I'm feeling anxiety 2 days after our second date because we didn't set up another date yet. I also didn't talk to him much yesterday. He did text ""good morning"" to me first everyday,  and very early in the morning. But after the second date, I ended up texting him ""good morning"" first. He did respond at least and said good morning back but that was all of the communication we had yesterday.

This morning, same thing happened and now I'm thinking I scared him off. 

We both like games and previously I was talking to him about a game that I have that I think he might enjoy. Well, towards the end of our second date (dinner at a nice restaurant), he said he had nothing else planned and then asked me what I had planned. I told him I was just gonna go home and chill but then I suggested he come over to play the game. He then says with a big smile "" wow, you like me like that?""  And I jokingly and playfully said ""no"".  

In all honesty, I don't know what he meant when he said ""like that"". I'm thinking now ""like what?"" I wish I had asked him then. I'm most likely overthinking it but I'm thinking ""like that"" might mean he thinks I like him enough to invite him over and fuck him on the second date. And by inviting him over it might of made him uninterested in me since he says he isn't looking for flings and hookups too.",
dating,147pihx,2023-06-12 14:42:29,I‚Äôm a single young guy trying to meet people and it‚Äôs absolutely brutal out here lol,"So I have had a lot of bad luck lately such as asking this really pretty girl at work for her number, seemingly getting a positive reaction from her thinking it could go somewhere but 3 times I‚Äôve made plans with her and she‚Äôs flaked and ghosted me the day of, inexplicably.. 3 times. I actually feel I played my cards right in our brief conversations too. Must be another man right? Whatever moving on

The other night I struck up a conversation with really pretty girl outside of some bar area. Again, I seemingly got a positive reaction and her phone number only to walk away and turn back to see her approached by another guy in less than a minute and also exchanged numbers. I was so put off I just deleted the number, I just knew it was never going anywhere.

THIS incident tho. JUST happened right now and actually surprised me a bit, but not really. I‚Äôm hard at work during my night shift when I got a tinder match. I don‚Äôt even use tinder much I only have it since Im obviously trying to meet someone now. It‚Äôs a really pretty girl, a couple years younger than me, barely legal tbh. I strike up a conversation with her. It goes really well & flowing and we are actually talking about real things. We exchange numbers and we actually text for several hours all while I‚Äôm busy working my shift. She lives by me, says she‚Äôs willing to meet on my days off, this seems really good. Get this tho guys, she tells me that she is celibate. I‚Äôm not thrilled to hear it and tbh didn‚Äôt even fully believe it, but there were moments where she had me convinced. I told her it was cool with me all while thinking that I could probably still make a move when we met. Long story short, I did some minor investigation and it wasn‚Äôt long before finding her only fans. I wouldn‚Äôt pay for her subscription but I saw she had a ‚Äúfree only fans‚Äù so  followed‚Ä¶ and Lo & behold the first thing I see. She‚Äôs riding some guy and multiple other videos all during the hours that we were texting. Admittedly, there were probably some red flags I should have spotted but I must be too innocent to understand how devious these women are.

I‚Äôm not even upset anymore it‚Äôs just really crazy out here like why try to play me like this just why lol","The first one is flaky and/or is trying to give a hint without rejecting you and making it awkward since you work together. Yes, move on.

Should i ask her out?","Tbh it kinda sounds like you might be in a friendzone situation and sometimes when a girl puts you in it, there may not be a way out.

dating,147p6px,2023-06-12 14:14:41,Tired of dating and thinking about getting back together with EX but they‚Äôre now long distance.,"Sort of a mix if rant and advice needed.

Is it a bad idea to try again with an ex even if it means possibly dropping everything and moving for them a second time?

We were in a relationship for almost 4 years that ended 7 years ago. We started talking again last year. we‚Äôve stayed friends and chat and game frequently. He wants to get back together and id be l willing to give it a shot if we lived closer but we live 500 miles apart. 
we both have full time jobs and he now makes enough to support both of us. I own a house and I doubt ill ever be able to actually afford one on my own ever again based on how high prices got after covid.

We met while I was in college in 2012 and we ended up being long distance for a year before I dropped my job and moved back to live with his parents and him. We broke up after 9 months due to poor communication and his parents being unable to understand me as i have autism and they convinced him I wasn‚Äôt good enough.

Its been 7 years and I haven‚Äôt been successful with any other relationship. He was engaged at some point but he broke it off once she became volatile.

Ive just never been able to click with anyone else the past 7 years the way that we still do. I keep getting ghosted or stood up on dates. The men that end up liking me have serious control issues so I end up breaking it off with them.

Im worried about dating him due to our long distance and I‚Äôm the one that would have to once again drop everything and move. His job is on site and he makes more than double what I do so it doesn‚Äôt make sense for him to move. I like the area I live in currently than where he lives.

Obviously we will move slowly and relearn each other. He‚Äôs gotten better at communicating about his thoughts and emotions. I have generalized anxiety disorder so i only think about what could go wrong rather than what good could happen.

I just feel uncomfortable having to possibly drop everything and move again. It doesn‚Äôt feel fair to me. Im also sick of dating but not dating and trying to just make friends got me nowhere. I didn‚Äôt magically meet anyone ‚Äúwhen i least expected it‚Äù, just got creepy neighbors the came and went.

TLDR: been struggling to date for 7 years and want to date an ex but we‚Äôre long distance and I don‚Äôt feel comfortable with moving.","That sounds like way more work than continuing the dating game. Also don‚Äôt settle despite how tired you are. No one ever ends up truly happy when they settle.

I will say that moving isn‚Äôt a bad general idea. Moving to a new place and trying new things and meeting different kinds of people would probably be a good change of pace"
dating,147p3f2,2023-06-12 14:10:30,Insecurity? Or what?,"I'm fairly active on Social Media. I am no influencer, but I enjoy just being a positive person and spread that light to others. I just got into a relationship recently and he is having a hard time understanding the dynamics of having a social media open for others, not just private. 
I am very loyal and never inappropriately talk to other men. I post photos with class and they are very modest, if I post a photo of myself. He claims I post ""thirst traps"" because I want attention from single men. That couldn't be further from the truth or my intentions. I feel like I can't do anything right or even post a photo of myself doing anything because if a man on the internet calls me ""pretty"", my boyfriend gets mad at me and accuses me of wanting to garner this attention in a negative way. I've been told and deeply feel this is insecurity on his part and I'm having trouble handling it because aside from this, we are great together. 
I've had women tell me that their husbands would support them and tell them they took a great pic, because they are loving and secure with themselves. I don't know. I am lost. I want to make him comfortable and have him mentioned all over my social media so it isn't like he is some secret. I don't want to lose myself trying to please him and I end up unhappy. 

Advice?","What's the nature of your posts?  Are you posting like Bikini pics etc?   Some men aren't down with that sort of thing from their s.o. Now, does that mean you should stop?  Not at all. Your life, your choice. But, this guy may not be the guy for you if this is one of his boundaries. Don't even think about the reasons why he had the boundary. That's his choice.

I trust my girlfriend. She is a sweet girl. And my gut feeling knows its not her . Even before me. She doesn't really get into relationships with other men. She had an ex back in high school but it only last a few months and when he flirted. She always shut him down back then because she was uncomfortable back then 

She is more open to me but she isnt the type to send nudes. 

She allows me access to her social media accounts and always tells me what shes doing, where shes going and who she is hanging out with .

I had a feeling something went wrong but no idea what. Turns out I kissed (just pecked) a guy twice at the bar. I had overwhelming guilt and told my boyfriend. We worked through it fine and it was never brought up again. 

Fast forward 6 months. Day drinking again and I black out. Apparently did the same thing at the bar as I did in October. I had absolutely zero recollection. I also apparently was so drunk I asked my friends where my one friend was when I was sitting right next to her . The last thing I remember at the bar was singing front row in front of the band with my friends. I didn't tell my boyfriend this time. But I still feel guilt to this day. Some days / months are harder than others. Since the second time I gave up drinking vodka and haven't drank vodka since April 2022 and haven't blacked out since. 

Most days I forget about it but some days it eats me alive. I want to spend the rest of my life with my boyfriend and have kids but some times I don't know how that's possible with this guilt. We bought a house together in December and now have a dog. 

I just want some advice/opinions on the situation.",
dating,147olpj,2023-06-12 13:48:32,Help..,"I am comfortable, I like her. I usually like spending time with her. It‚Äôs been almost a year, haven‚Äôt said ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù to her, I feel like she‚Äôs looking for it always saying ‚Äújust love on me‚Äù. Before this I got out of a 10-year relationship (engaged) and it was for the reason that they weren‚Äôt sure if I was deeply in love with them or if they were the easy choice. Currently things are not bad, sometimes I resent our pre-work talks and calls on my way. She has two girls who I do love in a way that I want them to succeed and I would do pretty much anything to secure that for them. I just don‚Äôt know sometimes, I may not be capable of romantic love, maybe I settle down to early? Regardless I have always been the man with the answers and I find myself lost; Reddit help me. 

Going in I told her I was in my fuck boy phase and not looking for anything, but she was super supportive of me always and looked to be there for me. She is a good woman and a great mother, I just don‚Äôt want to be stringing her along if it isn‚Äôt forever, but I‚Äôve looked eternity in the eyes and been apathetic previously. Something is broken in me and I don‚Äôt know what I need, or want, or deserve. 

I am very analytical, is there a metric that I can use to make this resonate for me in my autism brain?","Tbh if you‚Äôre actually autistic I think it‚Äôs worth speaking to a professional about what love looks/feels like for someone with autism. And if you‚Äôre not autistic I think you should still talk to a therapist anyway bc the fact that you aren‚Äôt able to figure out if you‚Äôre in love with a partner after 10 years and find yourself in a similar situation again suggests that there‚Äôs some baggage to unpack there.

There‚Äôs no metric for love, it‚Äôs just something you feel/know in your heart and want to tell your partner."

dating,147obla,2023-06-12 13:35:37,Just got hit with the ‚Äútoo busy for a romantic relationship‚Äù excuse,"I (38F) met this guy (35M) on Bumble and we clicked right away. He was funny, a great communicator, and I was super attracted to him. He was really attentive and did all the sweet things right away - pulled me on an empty patio to dance to Michael Bubl√© after date 2, deleted his Bumble date 3, turned my Claddagh ring around to show my heart was ‚Äútaken‚Äù, took our ‚Äúfirst picture‚Äù at a baseball game (implying there‚Äôd be more), always gave me little kisses and held my hand. I know I know. Usually I‚Äôd be on high alert because men have done too much too fast in the past and it was bad news. But for some reason I let my guard down with him. He never pushed for sex; I initiated the one time we did have sex.

About a month in to dating, I could feel he was pulling away. I messaged him the other day to see his plans for the weekend and it took him 10 hours to respond. He hit me with the ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be busy in the foreseeable future and don‚Äôt think I have time for a romantic relationship. If you‚Äôre open to it, I‚Äôd like to be friends.‚Äù I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs just an excuse to let me down easy, but if all true, why be on the apps?? And how does life getting a little busy mean you can‚Äôt date at all? So frustrated to get rejected again after believing all his crap.

TLDR - Let my guard down with someone, believed them, and got rejected because he‚Äôs ‚Äútoo busy‚Äù.","That style of dating makes sense for some people - they love the rush of something new and exciting so they dive right in, swim in the deep end and decide while they‚Äôre already in the water how long they want to stay. It seems silly to people who do the toe in the water to test the temp first method, but everyone has their own way."

I ended up asking her out and she said yes, gave me her number and showed me a screencap of her whole work schedule for the week so we picked a day that works for both of us.  


We're still texting a lot/sending voice messages, she's sending me selfies out of nowhere sometimes and all that, but I have noticed if I ever make a flirty comment, she will kinda just crack a random joke?

dating,147o46d,2023-06-12 13:26:14,Reluctant about Oral Sex.,"
I(23M) recently entered into a relationship with an amazing girl(23), and we have a great connection. We get along really well, and our chemistry is off the charts. However, I encountered a situation that left me feeling unsure and a bit awkward.

During our last night together, she expressed a desire for oral sex, but I found myself feeling reluctant and uncomfortable about it. I can't quite put my finger on why I feel this way, but the thought of engaging in oral sex is challenging for me to accept.

I really care about her and want to make her happy, but I also want to respect my own boundaries and comfort levels. I'm at a crossroads here and could use some advice.

Have any of you faced a similar situation? How did you navigate it? Or how I can initiate oral with her?",I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs an issue as long as you don‚Äôt expect getting oral yourself. It may be she doesn‚Äôt get much pleasure from penetrative sex so you might want to identify other ways you can please her without oral.
dating,147nwci,2023-06-12 13:15:44,Is she playing hard to get?,"Im (29M).
This girl i like (28F) I've known for 2 weeks is a collegue at work and used to be a forner classmate a decade ago. This tuesday we'll be going out for pizza between the two of us.

Right off the bat, she's flirty and touchy-feely with me the first week of knowing each other at work. Between feeling my shoulders, grabbing me by the arm and saying things to me like 'its a shame i'm not from her area' and an idea of hers was also 'to get pizza some place'.

She's also kinda shy. Doesn't do much all day appart from going out for grocerys and play videogames at home and doesn't like to go out cause she's afraid of crowds. And to be fair, i still have to get to know more of her.

Fastforward, i muster some courage and asked her what she was doing this tuesday and if she wanted pizza at a place i know, offering also to pick her up and taking her back home. She seemed happy but was also thinking about it.
After awhile she says Yes! But tells me 'no bullshit, only as friends' which is fine and wouldn't be an issue, she can have it her way.

Im a bit left confused since it was her idea but me inviting her out seems off?
Maybe she says this to make herself seem guarded. Maybe testing me also?
Only thing i can think of is to play cool and casual.

What gives?","Mmmh I know a girl like this who is a bit of the shy or naive side kinda? She gets touchy alot more than other girls I know but generally with everyone.

Might be she really only sees you as a friend and wants to catch up/is exicted seeing you again. Furthermore many dont want to date at their workplace.

Do it like you said, be casual and be happy that you maybe win a potential friend."

dating,147mkc8,2023-06-12 12:10:50,"Seeking Advice: Finding a Meaningful Relationship in India - Interests in Fitness, Gaming, Martial Arts, Entrepreneurship, Anime.","Hey everyone,

I'm reaching out to this community for some guidance on finding a meaningful relationship in India. I'm a guy with a range of interests and a strong sense of confidence. If you have a moment, I'd greatly appreciate your input!

Let me give you a glimpse into who I am: I'm into fitness, gaming, martial arts, entrepreneurship, and anime. But here's the fascinating part - I'm the kind of guy who's so confident that he knows he can achieve anything he sets his mind to. When I decide to pursue something, I give it my all and make it happen. 

[ I've consciously avoided pursuing romantic relationships until now. As I was extremely goal focused (pursuing entrepreneurship and building my own empire),which I'm still. However, I've reached a point where I feel the need for companionship and the joy that comes from sharing life's adventures with someone special. ]

While physical attraction matters, it's equally important for me to connect with someone on an emotional and intellectual level. I value deep conversations, shared interests, and a sense of adventure. Anime, with its vibrant storytelling and captivating characters, is one of my passions that adds a unique flavor to my life.

I'm curious to hear your suggestions on how and where I can meet like-minded individuals in India. Whether it's through online platforms, social events, or other avenues, I'm open to ideas. If any of you have successfully navigated the dating scene in India and have tips to share on building genuine connections, I'd love to hear from you.

Lastly, if you're a girl who appreciates confidence and wants to explore the wonders of anime together, or if you know someone who might, feel free to check out my Instagram profile. I share snippets of my journey in fitness, gaming, martial arts, entrepreneurship, and anime, offering glimpses into the intriguing aspects of my life.

[But here's the intriguing part - the more you start to know about me, the more you realize you know nothing about me. I enjoy keeping an air of mystery around me, making life exciting and full of surprises.]

I appreciate any advice, suggestions, or personal experiences you can share.

dating,147mezq,2023-06-12 12:02:53,Newly Single (what do I do?),"Hi, new to Reddit but have read some of the posts in this category and would love some advice! 

Will start with some context. My partner ended things between us recently, I am a very driven person and have always known what I want in life. Go to Uni, get a job, save and buy a house, get a better job, save for more houses and repeat etc. I have been with my girlfriend since we were 18, I am now 24. We were in the process of looking for a house when all of this went down. She has always had difficulties with her independence and because of the way I was brought up I know what needs to be done in everyday life, whether this is laundry, cooking, cleaning, bills. I was forced to take on a parent like role for my partner, whilst I‚Äôve always liked the feeling of somebody being dependent on me, the lack of contribution from my partner was horrendous. Because of my job and being taught to save I would pay all bills for my partner, all she had to pay was her half of the rent but I would cover all bills, groceries, take aways, dates, furniture, council tax etc, I even bought us a car I didn‚Äôt want so she could learn to drive. This isn‚Äôt me complaining because I was always happy to do this and offered, as we‚Äôd been together so long and were looking to buy a house and get married etc I was of the opinion that everything was shared. All of this would‚Äôve been fine if we had stayed together because I saw it as making her less stressed about money and having a life we both enjoyed. 

Now comes the difficult part. What in the hell do I do? I have been with the same partner for nearly 6 years and have no idea how to date and start again, I don‚Äôt want to look for a partner, date, introduce her to family and friends, wait 3 years and buy a house together etc. I‚Äôve been dating the wrong person for all my formative years and it‚Äôs upsetting and stressful that I could‚Äôve done other things, dated different people. I know it wasn‚Äôt a waste because I learned lots about myself and this abrupt end has been useful to find out what I want. 

I‚Äôm worried that people won‚Äôt find me attractive and won‚Äôt want a below average dong. I bring a lot to the table in my defence, I make great money for my age (¬£50k + at 24), I have enough saved to buy a house on my own, I‚Äôm 6‚Äô4, great friends and family. I just don‚Äôt want to fall into the trap again of me just providing everything and repeat the same process. I know I‚Äôm young but I feel as though this is the end of my dating life  (which I know is dumb). How the hell do you even meet people in 2023? 

No hate for my ex, life‚Äôs too short to do something you‚Äôre unhappy with and I told her I respected her decision and I genuinely wish her all the happiness in the world.","Enjoy doing the things you may have given up during this relationship. Take up a hobby that you‚Äôve always wanted too but weren‚Äôt able to. Be single. Don‚Äôt date.

Another said that if they have long toenails it‚Äôs a red flag since it means they don‚Äôt care for themselves

dating,147mbub,2023-06-12 11:58:44,Still messaging after the first date but hasn‚Äôt scheduled one yet,"Had a really great first date on Friday, yes we had sex. We‚Äôve been texting since after (I messaged him first) the effort in messages has stayed similar even though they have become a bit more sporadic (like seemingly every chance he got to 3-5 a day). I do know that he doesn‚Äôt/cannot text during work and am not expecting that. 

When he left on Saturday morning, he said he had a good time and asked if I wanted to do something soon. In our messages he‚Äôs mentioned a next time or has otherwise alluded to such a time. However we haven‚Äôt scheduled anything. Yesterday evening I sent him a message, in response to one of the allusions, asking when he thought a next time may be. 

It‚Äôs the next morning and he has yet to respond. He does start work pretty early (70/80 hr work weeks) and is switching from night shifts to day shifts rn so I get that the response times etc will change. 

For scheduling context, he asked me out the first day we were talking and picked an activity but didn‚Äôt finalize the date until the night before. That being said we went out 3 days after we started talking and we started talking on a day he had off.

I just can‚Äôt tell if he is actually interested and has things going on or is just bored and chatting. Any advice appreciated!",80 hours a week is tough. Thats like 16 hours a day when he gets home hes slumped. But if you want to make it work how about you schedule the next date? Take turns. Ask when his next day off is and say ‚Äúlets do this!‚Äù. Keep in mind his sleep schedule will be all over the place. Good luck thoo

We ended up going out twice last week and having a couple of 2 hr long phone calls.  We ended up agreeing that yes, we are in a relationship and have achieved the elusive boyfriend/girlfriend status.  We've had some preliminary discussions about managing money and what we envision the next 20 yrs to look like and just talked about ""hypothetically if I ever get married, etc........."" type stuff.

dating,147lxo7,2023-06-12 11:37:20,New girl,"So I just met this new girl 33 a week ago threw a mutual friend. I‚Äôve never hit it off this well this soon with someone before, it was so refreshing hours seemed like minutes. We hooked up the first night right away ( that was all her I didn‚Äôt push for sex I usually don‚Äôt on a first meet up ) we hung out 5 days in a row but the last day we hung out was kinda weird towards the end. She‚Äôs a bartender so I was hanging out with her at work until she got off around 11 then we went to Buffalo Wild Wings to watch the fights. As we were leaving she kissed me and said she would ride over after she dropped her friend off and took a shower. She never showed up, called or texted and I haven‚Äôt reached out. She‚Äôs been active on social media and she was the one doing most of the pursuing. What do you guys think? Maybe it‚Äôs a test and should I reach out? I won‚Äôt be back in town for a few days maybe wait until then. I really like her so I‚Äôm trying not to mess this up lol.

dating,147lvnj,2023-06-12 11:34:15,Moving far away from someone I want to be with,"So I (20F) met a guy (21M) in my first year of university, towards my second year we got very close and became best friends. One night, we went out together and eventually became more than friends. We spent every day of the last 3 months together, often sleeping at each-others houses and going out together. Even though we never declared exactly what we were. We agreed in this time that it was almost exclusive so neither of us were seeing other people. He is in the year above me so it was always inevitable that we would be split at some point but at the time the distance didn‚Äôt seem too much of an issue because his home town and where I went to university was only a 1.5 hour train ride away. However, I recently got offered a job which is a further 2 hours away meaning it‚Äôs even harder for me to see him.

I‚Äôve been finding it really hard to deal with because I think this is my person but I don‚Äôt know how to voice this to him. He is very realistic and has no intention of ever moving away from his home town. I‚Äôm afraid of us drifting apart and me losing what we once had and I can‚Äôt move on (at least not yet) because I compare everyone to him. I will be moving back to university next year so we will be less far apart, but I fear that he will find someone else in that time and that we will be reduced to just friends again.

TLDR; I met someone at university who I think is my person, but now we are moving 3.5 hours away from each other and I don‚Äôt know what to do.

I need advice on whether it‚Äôs best to just let go or hold on hope and keep trying with him to see if we eventually come together.",He is not even your boyfriend... What are you talking about?

dating,147like,2023-06-12 11:13:44,SEX ADVICE NEEDED,"I (24F) have had limited sexual experiences, with only one previous partner. In that relationship, whenever I was on top during penetration, my ex would reach orgasm relatively quickly, usually within 3-5 minutes. He would even ask me to switch positions to missionary if he felt he was getting too close to climax, so that he could last longer. This made me believe that I was doing something right while being on top.

However, with my current partner, I've noticed a puzzling pattern. Every time we switch to the woman-on-top position, he tends to lose his erection. I've tried various techniques like bouncing, grinding, circular motions, and different rhythms, but it consistently leads to him losing firmness.

I can count on my fingers the number of times he has orgasmed through penetration alone (note that I've given him oral sex before penetration). Most of the time, he asks me to give him oral sex or a handjob after some time of penetration, and that's when he reaches climax.  


I've been wanting to talk about this to him but I always find myself stepping back because I'm afraid things might get awkward after. What's the best way to open up a conversation about this? 

**This situation has raised several questions in my mind:** Am I not performing well enough while being on top? Is there something I'm doing wrong or not doing enough? Why does it appear difficult for him to climax during intercourse, while it's comparatively easier for him through oral sex or manual stimulation? What can I do to make him orgasm from intercourse?

And for the guys, what are some things that your girlfriends do during WOT that you enjoy the most?

I would greatly appreciate any insights, advice, or personal experiences you can share. Thank you!","Ok here's the thing... every guy is different. What turns one guy on and makes him go off in minutes isn't guaranteed to work for every dude... funny how that works isn't it because it's the same for women and the thing with successful sex is... and I'm gonna yell this so the cheap seats at the back hear... the big ol' secret is COMMUNICATION !!!! Tell him what you like. Ask him what he likes. And do it !!! The formula for successful sex is pretty simple. I'll give you a for instance. Most guys I know love themselves a blowjob. Personally I hate them. Complete waste of everybody's time and energy for me. Everyone has likes and dislikes and the only way to find out is to fumble around for ages and waste everyone's time OR cut to the chase, have the fun conversation and have the awesome horizontal naked yum yum time... your choice...."

dating,147l2pu,2023-06-12 10:49:33,Is he over his ex and old relationship,"

I have been with my partner for 1.5 years now but we were friends for a long time before getting together. he has not opened up to me yet and we lack intimacy within the bedroom and emotionally. I feel like there's a big barrier between us and he's scared of being attached to me for some reason. 

Whenever we have arguments or discussions about our feelings toward each other he has nothing to say and is usually just quite. He avoids conflict and confrontation a lot by just not talking about it but it's not helping our relationship at all. I've stayed with him for a long time despite this because I know he's a good person but I feel like I'm hurting myself in the process and that this relationship has no future like I thought it did. 

I voiced my concerns many times but it doesn't seem to get through to him that I need a little more from him and he says he will try but we haven't gotten anywhere with this. His previous relationship was rocky but it ended several years ago and I don't know if that's what is stopping him. I also had a very traumatic long term relationship prior to this and took a longtime to open myself up to anyone but I feel like it's all one sided with him where I'm constantly trying to grow our relationship and he's not. I'm a bit lost and don't understand what I should be doing because I've been trying to salvage this relationship for a long time. 

I feel like he's sabotaging this relationship because of his past issues but maybe I'm looking at it differently and he just doesn't want the same things I do. When I mention taking breaks or just going our separate ways he doesn't want that but also isn't giving our relationship anything to stand or grow on. What does this even mean and is there any hope for this or am I just being delusional?","Questions. What are your ages? How committed to the long haul in a relationship are you if he did open up?

We went on dates and go every week since we started and we were exclusive from the start.But there is never mention of sex or doing something more intimate than kissing when dropping her off at home,or hugging and holding hands.This puts me off as why would someone you love ,not want to sleep with you from the start and keeps you waiting for months.Shes my girlfriend and perfect in every way and love her very much but it makes me doubt myself sometimes and feel kinda of embarrassed that we have been intimate.

We text,and go out every week due to both of us working weird patterns,we only see eachother for a few hours in the afternoon.I know some people love language is different but we don't cuddle,facetime,haven't been to her house or meet her parents,barely takes photos or hasn't posted me on socials,we havent slept together. She shows love through others small gestures and I appreciate them.She also says I'm her first boyfriend and she's hasn't slept with anyone,she said she likes to take things slow.But sometimes I don't feel that she's my girlfriend, like she's not clingy, touchy or romantic, doesn't intiate  things and I find it so hard as a man.cause I would expect it from a woman to be more romantic. I just don't know why I'm her boyfriend if she doesn't want to sleep etc...

I‚Äôm not otherworldly gorgeous but I‚Äôm self-aware and observant enough to know that I‚Äôm not unattractive. But my experience on dating apps (like Bumble) is terribly discouraging and affecting my self-esteem. I put effort into my profile and it‚Äôs unique, but not off-putting. Either convo‚Äôs reach a dead-end too soon from their end, or they make it sexual immediately, they just don‚Äôt respond, or they unmatch. Man, nothing hurts like thinking you‚Äôre having a good conversation with someone, only to get unmatched abruptly. 

Am I too old? Is it cause I‚Äôm of Middle Eastern descent? Should I be more stoic? In some of my pics I wear genuinely trendy and tight black dresses that depict the figure I work hard for.

She basically deemed her chances with me over by the fact that she was late for the date (which killed the vibe for me since it made her seem insecure).

What do you think? Do you normally know the type of relation you will have/want with the other person right away?

&#x200B;

EDIT:Based on the responses i got so far i think i worded my question wrongly.

What I am trying to ask is if the first impression (pontuality,how they look/act the first moments you guys meet) will decide the fate of that relation in your mind (be it a casual,serious or no relationship at all) before actually having a conversation/knowing them better?","Hmm, that‚Äôs interesting‚Ä¶ I do believe it depends on different people, but if sb decide what they want right away without getting to know their date better, it may reflect their personality as insecure or arrogant or selfish, which may lead to toxic relationships or broken hearts in various relationships. Dating should be mutual, right? I think it happens to my coworker that he-a 35 single man with the same trait as OP‚Äôs date- still remains single because he was completely closed off and quick to define his dates based on his pov. Imagine he looks at you and he knew exactly you can do nothing for the relationship with him, and he do not let you have any chance to express yourself. Maybe a conversation is enough for him, but it is destructive for his relationships in the future as YOU CANT FIND ANY WOMAN WHO FITS YOUR TASTE AT THE FIRST GLANCE BUT WE HAVE TO WORK ON THE RELATIONSHIP TO MAKE IT WORK! My opinion, hope it‚Äôs help!"
dating,147kelu,2023-06-12 10:09:42,Ever broken things off because of lack of hygiene?,"I've (25) been seeing this guy (28) or just over 2 months, we have a great emotional + physical bond. However, over the last few weeks, I've started to acknowledge some less than hygienic habits he has.

- He eats food in his room, leaves it on his bedside table/desk overnight (even if it's meat) while he's sleeping + then will sometimes finish it for breakfast the next day. I've had to remove the food to the kitchen myself if I'm sleeping over.
- He doesn't ever seem to have hand soap or a separate hand towel in his bathroom (he also never offers me a clean towel to shower with when I stay over, he just offers his own so I've started bringing my own). The lack of hand soap thing makes me feel a bit weird about sex. 
- He also talks a lot about talking about with his parents for financial advice / help, which in itself is not that odd but paired with the above makes me feel like he hasn't fully grown into himself, rather than using his parents as a useful source of advice. I've also noticed he's let me pick up the bill in the majority of cases lately, citing that he's ""broke"" etc (he earns double what I do), even though we were splitting things pretty evenly early on, which I prefer to do early on in dating unless there's a specific financial sitch that warrants temporary asymmetry. 

He was a true gent for the first few weeks we were seeing each other, but feels like he's slipped very quickly into ""comfortable partner"" territory before we've even made things official.

Have you ever stopped seeing someone due to an incompatibility in hygiene/domestic habits? I'm not sure how to communicate this, and whether I should keep things more vague when I break things off for him, but he'll almost definitely press for more info.

dating,147kca0,2023-06-12 10:05:32,"Boyfriend had nudes, watches porn, lies and blames everything on me","So after not dating since 2017/2018 at all, as per a post I made here months ago, I decided to take it slowly, we started off as friends introduced by a guy who was hitting on me at the time. 

We clicked on most of the things and had very similar views, so we naturally hanging out everyday started getting close to each other, plus he also helped me get a job which was in his company in the same shifts, we also lived in the same building, so naturally things happened. 

The beginning was ok, but after 1 month as he was showing me some picture on his phone, started showing a lot of reels and pictures of a certain lady, which he told me was a  childhood friend that they tried to give a go but didn't work, later on he mentions a lady cheated on him and he was sad about it and this lady was fucking another 4 to 6 guys every week at the same time as him, I asked if he used to wear condom with her, he said yes straight away. as time goes by, he does a really nice gesture and takes me on a 1 week holiday and he paid for everything, its due to my financial circumstances which were very bad at the time, due to work issue from previous job.

We are having amazing time, this is where issue start, I add his fingerprint to my phone and he does the same, one of the days I was without internet and dead phone but because he was sleeping on me, instead of going around snooping on his phone, I just wanted to see pictures as it would pass the time until he would wake up, I also see looking at pictures as not an invasion of privacy but also not considered snooping to me, I go to top of the album then I see the lady again, as I scrow slowly I see pictures he took of her breast, of her VAGINA AND ASSHOLE, 4 years AFTER they broke up, I saw everything, but there were so many naked pictures of her but also with clothes  on, he apologises and deletes it, immeadiately I wanted to break up with him but he wont let me, so we get back to the country we live in, there was a picture hanging all over his wall of a girl I dont regognise, of him squeezing her ass, huging her, I ask who is this, mind you, this is nearly 1 week after we got back, he says the same girl that had nude pictures, I lose it, he tries to hide the picture somewhere and takes it down, at this point I ask him to check his phone because I dont want to start a relationship with  someone who is not over an ex, he deletes all messages and whatsapp between them, I see a screenshot of some sex related stuff they sent to each other year before, I then also see that he paid for 4 to 5 different trips for her on his own plus hotel and everything, which he then denied saying he never paid it for her, when I get evidence he says hes sorry, I by accident catch on his phone history him watching porn everyday at work with ladies with big boobs, I had always medium boobs but I lost more than 25kg due to stressful prior work, so I am not feeling the best, when I see the porm he says I am not supposed to find out or see it, which adds on to issues we had, after that everyday I dont have sex with him but I also start arguing, because in my mind no man who doesnt like or love a woman, will not keep taking that many pictures or pay for multiple trips on his own, but he denies, he then started blaming on me everything, saying the fights are my fault not his, that I am the one who starts this issues and that I need to move on and stop, he then uses reddit to say my gilfriend founds pictures of ex on the phone, where the answer says its normal but he didnt type nude pictures of ex after 4 years, he had an ex after which there were not even 10 pictures of, he keeps telling me I need to forget about when I told him I  wanted to breakup multiple times, I dont love him as much anymore and I feel disgusted to be with him or even kiss him.

We usually stair at each other, but the problem is we go to the same school, but different classes. So I can‚Äôt find a way to start talking to her. Yesterday i sent her a follow request, and fortunately she accepted it. Now i have no idea what to do to get close to her and start talking to her.
HELP","It's simple! You seem young and I've been in your shoes, this girl might not even like you so keep that in mind, but don't fear rejection. She could also very well feel the same way.

What I usually do is:

1. Like a few of her posts, not all of them, and wait to see if she likes any of yours. If she likes some of your posts then move to step 2 lol, if not, move to step 2 anyway after a week or so
2. Just DM her! Don't try and ""rizz"" her up, don't be anything but yourself. Let's say you wanted to make a friend, how would you open that up? Best way to get close to a girl, is to innocently open as friends. 
3. So talk to her for however long you feel comfortable, opening message would be something simple as ""Hey we go to (SCHOOL) together, I've always thought you seemed cool and wanted to know you"". Don't overthink, the biggest barriers young men need to break is thinking women/girls are wayyyy different to how they are. (THEY ARE NOT) 
4. So just see how she responds, if she even does. If she's being ""dry"" or seems uninterested, you're not doing anything wrong, she just sorta knows what you want and isn't interested in YOU, which is fine, don't feel bad. But she will probably be friendly and talk to you, keep conversation interesting, ask about her interests, maybe give the convo some space and invite her out eventually. (things like conversation come with time, you'll gain conversation overtime, don't put lots of weight on this girl)
5. Finally, would be meeting in person. Talk, have fun, feel out if she likes you, and if you actually like HER as a person. Just enjoy the time and decide if you wanna make a move. Then you can simply ask her out if you feel its right. You should know if she's into you or not.

So in general, my advice, and this has worked for ME, is to approach women in this friendly way. Worst case is they gently let me down, best case she escalates the conversation with me to a romantic stage. And your safety net is always being friends, which is also nice, who doesn't want a new friend lol. 

You may fear the friendzone, but don't lol, it's bullshit invented by obsessive men. If this girl doesn't want anything just simply move on, nothing would have changed that. This made messaging and meeting girls a lot less scary for me, and I imagine its refreshing to be talked to like a person for a lot of women.

SIDENOTE

Escalating from that friendliness to something romantic, is done through simple flirting. This doesn't mean being overtly sexual or weird, just appropriately escalating and seeing if she gives you that energy back. Examples include shared eye contact with each other, compliments around her appearance or personality (something like, you guys just finished laughing about something ""you have a cute laugh haha"" idk), in message form something like  ""would like to spend more time with you"" or the classic ""call it a date"". These things you can EASILY pull back on, you're not fully committing, they're natural signals to her that you're romantically interested, that she can easily decline or engage in. As time goes on obviously you can go further."
dating,147jxn9,2023-06-12 09:41:33,asking a guy out for a date for what is the third time. how many times is okay before you come off as desperate/too easy?,"additional context: i(21f) have been talking to this one guy(20) i met online. 

he rides motorcycles, and i absolutely love riding  them, and he kindly offered to take me on a motorcycle ride at some point. i was ecstatic and proposed a day, but he said be already had things lined up and couldn't, and that he was sorry.

all good, i was taking this as another polite rejection (funky, i know) BUT he texts me 15-ish days later asking me if i want to go on the motorcycle ride sometime? i agreed, and that was easilt one of the loveliest dates i've ever had. 

i asked him out on the second date, and that went decently as well, i like to believe. something worth mentioning is that he had said that he was somewhat socially-awkward m, when i had made a comment about how he could just make himself comfortable without waiting for me to join him on the couch.

i would love to ask him out (again), but im wondering if this is going to cause me to come off too strong, or worse, scare him away. not too sure, should i wait for him to ask me out, or shall i do it?

Since then I've dated a handful women but nothing too serious I've been improving myself by going to the gym, eating clean (Lost almost 30kg) and getting my career underway.  
  
We both haven't talked since then apart from a text message or two just after the breakup. But over the last few weeks, I've been thinking about her not everyday but often.

Is this way of thinking flawed?","I don't see the point of staying friends with ex's. I didn't want them as just a friend in my life, even though friendship was also part of the overall relationship.

So after 5 days she texted me back that she is sorry, it was not personal, she did not want to be rude, and that sometimes she just needs time to disappear (while disappearing she was posting on instastorys).

dating,147hw4p,2023-06-12 07:31:33,Me (24M) and my girlfriend (21F) hit our first major roadblock right before I go long distance for work,"So on the whole, we are in a loving relationship of almost a year. However, last month we seemingly resolved our first conflict. Above all, it was a communication and emotional one. I am extroverted and emotional, she is used to a far more reserved crowd and affection and kindness come less naturally than sass and humor. When she would get frustrated I would push to know why, and when I got upset I felt I needed her to have a conversation in a way unnatural to her. Meanwhile, her terse responses would only trigger me further, putting us in a bit of a cycle.

Fast forward and I am mostly done with a work trip as she is recently back from the cruise. Honestly, my trip went to shit and was incredibly stressful. We recently clashed over this when I reached out poorly for support. She‚Äôs simultaneously saddened she can‚Äôt help and frustrated that I ask for something artificial to her as someone who expresses affection. even if we both agree this is a normal request of support in a relationship. We both agree her affection and kindness is non-verbal and not the traditional support I am used to from my circle of friends and family.

How does she support me without it feeling artificial and in what way could she manifest a usually subtle love? Should I even lean on her like this or is that unfair to her? How do we navigate a likely repeat issue and I wind up for a long work-heavy summer of entire weeks apart at a time.",">We recently clashed over this when I reached out poorly for support. 

What are the details here? You ""reached out poorly""? What does that mean? 

Relationships are about balance. Compromise needs to happen, or things wont work out. 

Also, she's 21. When I was 21, I didnt know what the fuck I was doing or what I wanted. I didnt know what a great relationship was or how to cultivate one. I was just young and living life as I knew how to live it. She will change over time, but right now maybe she's a bit immature for what you are trying to do? I dunno if thats true for her, but its worth considering.

>Should I even lean on her like this or is that unfair to her?

Should you be able to lean on your own SO for support? Answer that question, and you have your answer."

It almost doesnt matter. If the person finds you interesting/attractive, it wont really matter how you connect. 

>Been avoiding Dating apps bec of their awfull reputation I read here and in other forums espacially as a man. Is it worth a shot to spent time in? Should I get Premium stuff?

The scam of dating apps is that they make you think paying for ""premium"" suddenly gets you more girls. Maybe for some people it does, but for most people who are insecure/low self esteem, it will just create more frustration. 

Only get into dating apps if you absolutely give no fucks about rejection. If you care at all about being rejected on apps, then stay off of them."

We decided we would just continue dating as we have without any intense expectations. He is falling back into the ‚Äúnot reaching out stage‚Äù again and i don‚Äôt know what to do.

dating,147h9ny,2023-06-12 06:52:36,Should I move out of my parents house?,"I (19f) live with my parents, I haven‚Äôt moved out as I am in nursing school and work at a gas station so I cannot afford to pay for anything other than my own living necessities. I graduated high school in 2022 with the plan to go to college to be a teacher and athletic trainer (AT) but my dad, who was a cop for 20yrs, said working public service would not be the smartest decision and I would never make enough money to fully support myself and my family. He said if I did that they would not help me and I‚Äôd have to find a husband with a good job to support me. He and my mother pushed me to go to nursing school as a back ally way to getting the career I wanted and after much push back I agreed. I start CNA school in August of this year. 

I got a boyfriend, we‚Äôll call him K, (22m) roughly 3 months ago, this is not my fist boyfriend but my first serious ‚Äúwow I think I‚Äôm gonna marry this guy‚Äù. We both feel we‚Äôve known each other for years. With him every thing is so easy we have little arguments from time to time and bickering matches but once both of us have had some space and time to cool off and think it‚Äôs very easily resolved and we both apologize. I spend most of my time either with him or at work, I don‚Äôt spend a lot of time at home except Saturday nights when I don‚Äôt have to work b/c we usually do a family cookout where we drink and have lots of fun. My dad now drives trucks for FedEx at night so our schedules are very different from each other. We basically see each other in the hallways. Like any other teenager my chore (cleaning the bathroom) isn‚Äôt always done and my room is usually a mess. Fountain drinks on the nightstand clothes on the floor and snacks on the other side of the bed. I know I should do a better job of keeping my room clean and doing my chores more often but my dad seems to rly have a problem with me wanting to be with K in most of my spare time. My dad has threatened me with kicking me out and just outright forcing me to stay home. He says that I am not K‚Äôs wife and I need to be focused on my family and taking care of them instead of up K‚Äôs ass all the time. I am the oldest daughter of three (all girls) so I understand it‚Äôs a learning curve for me and my parents as I will be the first bird leaving the nest.

I am not a little kid anymore tho and I need to learn how to be an adult for myself. It seems my parents expect me to already know how to be an adult when I‚Äôve never been on my own and always had them to fall back on. I have no experience besides paying my own bills such as credit card, maintenance on my pickup, insurance for said vehicle, and my phone bill. They treat me like I am 16 tho and often tell me I‚Äôm immature and childish when I get upset about my dad wanting to nitpick all the things he doesn‚Äôt like about K or the things we do. Like sitting in the back porch alone together cuddling on the couch or even just kissing. 

He often threatens to take away my truck as well as it is still in his name b/c my parents used it as collateral for a loan they pulled out. They extended the loan to help me pay for replacing broken parts on the truck when I couldn‚Äôt afford to do it b/c I maxed out my credit card to help pay for my college. We even argued about that, he waves that ‚Äúfavor‚Äù he did for me over my head and teases me with the title making me feel it‚Äôs unattainable. 

I wouldn‚Äôt have had to use my credit card for college if my parents didn‚Äôt use money I had been saving for college, just over 2,000 USD, since the 6th grade to pay for bills when my dad lost his job. This happened again my junior year, my dad lost his job and they borrowed money from me to help with bills. Again the summer after I graduated when my grandmother died and we had to be out of state for hospital stays and funeral planning. I once again freely gave them money. I was happy to give them the money and didn‚Äôt even expect them to pay me back, the way I saw it was I was taking care of my family and helping them. I don‚Äôt hold it over my parents heads except one time I was arguing with my dad about how I, by his own proclamation, had earned the title to my truck. He said I didn‚Äôt earn anything and I said all the money I‚Äôve given him is more than enough to buy it from him and that he had said so himself. The truck is an old 2007 Dodge Ram 1500 and is only worth about 5 grand. They never paid me back money wise instead bought my my first car, 2006 Ford Mustang, which was later totaled when a semi truck ran over me. 

I feel stuck as the truck is my only means of transportation and without it I can‚Äôt do anything let alone move out. I love my boyfriend but I also love my family and I want to keep everyone happy. K has been very understanding through all of this and he doesn‚Äôt push me to move out or to stay as he doesn‚Äôt want me to regret the decision and blame him. I know he loves me very much but I can feel the pressure from my dad putting a strain on mine and K‚Äôs relationship. 

My dad and I used to be very close but now I feel like I walk on eggshells with him. I‚Äôm sorry for the long post I just don‚Äôt know what to do anymore or how to feel. I need outside opinions. Am I in the wrong?",
dating,147h9co,2023-06-12 06:52:01,This guy(28M) I‚Äôm dating has lots of red flags but I am scared to cut him off(24F)‚Ä¶should I still do it?,"I (24F) have seen this guy from tinder, K(28M), about 5 times since January. There seems to be a million red flags and I feel like I should cut him off again but I know it would hurt a lot.

- He‚Äôs a dad of 1, he didn‚Äôt tell me until the first date (in January). I cut him off because I did not want to date a parent. 
- He wanted another chance recently, so I did. I became more open to the idea of dating a dad as I became more attracted to him. Although it‚Äôs too early, we agreed to something more serious if things worked out.
- I cut him off again recently because he said his BM has a bf (while convincing to give him a chance) but in person he said he never said that and he has no idea who she‚Äôs dating currently. He also hid his IG stories from me and said he had no idea how it happened, I got triggered as I felt like I was being lied to. I instantly regret it and missed him so bad, so we ended up rekindling yet again. 
- We had sex for the first time recently; it seems like the first dates started off as romantic and are now getting lazier. Typically I come over to his place to smoke (sometimes have sex) and then we will eat somewhere and sometimes go shopping.
- He isn‚Äôt an active listener, on the phone I‚Äôll tell him a quick story and he will reply with something completely different like what he just saw on his phone. I‚Äôve asked him a couple times, ‚ÄúDid you even hear what I just said?‚Äù He occasionally asks but he mostly doesn‚Äôt ask many questions about myself, I definitely ask more about him and his life. 
- Other concerns: he doesn‚Äôt have a car currently (his broke down, plans to get a new one soon), so I have been driving to his house (about 20 min away) and we use my car to go out. He works two jobs as a server under the table and mentioned he needs to get his credit up. He also does not have a current driver‚Äôs license, he said he let it expire and needs to retake the test. He drove my car and his car before telling me about having no license.
- He seems to be a bit demanding, we‚Äôve been working around his schedule and not mine (he is more available in the day as he works late nights) so sometimes he will want me to come over super early in the morning and will still ask me to ‚Äúwear something sexy for him‚Äù.
- Yesterday was our longest day together (over 12 hours), when we said bye he said to hit him up. He ignored my texts about getting home, he replied to my IG story saying ‚Äútfti‚Äù last night but when I said he didn‚Äôt text me back, he left me on read. Basically didn‚Äôt talk at all today which is not typical. 

My gut is telling me obviously that he would not make a good partner, but I know cutting him off would hurt so bad. If I were to cut him off, this would definitely be the last time as of course he would not let me back into his life yet again. He crosses the list of superficial things I like(he‚Äôs my type physically, he‚Äôs slightly older, has his own place, lives in the area I dream to move to) etc. I am feeling very bummed out as I am rarely attracted to the men I‚Äôve gone out with, he is one of the very few I‚Äôve had feelings for. Should I just suck it up and cut him off for good or should I still keep him around and see if he will reach out? I have made the mistake of staying with my ex who also had lots of red flags which led to a super painful breakup and I do not want to go through that again.

TLDR; The man I‚Äôm seeing has red flags; should I cut him off completely or keep him around and see if things can improve?","You're incompatible, and should absolutely cut him off. If you were keeping things at a hook up level, that might have been okay, but you're trying to force a relationship that clearly doesn't have a future."
dating,147h2k1,2023-06-12 06:40:04,"Some men are weird, hopefully not all...","Picture this: a little while ago, there's this guy I was considering dating, right? And all of a sudden, he hits me with this crazy line, saying, 'You know, I'm in a real bind here. I can't decide if I should jump into bed with you or take you out on a proper date.'Can you imagine? I went completely MIA after that. Seriously, who asks someone that? Obviously, he's got no options left now.",I think he may have been trying to use some kind of 'pickup-artist' type of line on you.
dating,147h12l,2023-06-12 06:37:19,New to dating and already over it because of my own flaws,"I (28m) split with a long term partner a little while ago, I've not had to date in my adult life.

Met a girl on Hinge, went on a date, and it was absolutely amazing. I felt we clicked instantly, she ticked all the boxes I had and some I didn't even know I had. Amazingly smart, funny, really interesting woman. On the way home I distinctly remember thinking I wouldn't need another first date. 

Over the next few weeks I basically fumbled it by becoming attached too fast, and assuming we were a sure thing. Been told it's Anxious Attachment Style. And I'm now here wondering if I ruined what should've been a forever thing. 

I've tried to move on and met some other women but none have had that instant spark that she had.   
And obviously I don't want to message her and apologise as it won't work, I've already played my hand. 

I don't even know why I'm writing this. Friends are tired of hearing about it, that's for sure.","Happens to the best of us man. It's okay, it happens. Best thing to do is look to a better tomorrow instead of harping on past mistakes. You sound like you've kearney the lesson, just move forward and apply those lessons next time."
dating,147gzxj,2023-06-12 06:35:19,I (25M) hate the girl( 22F) i‚Äôm seeing but sex is too good,"We‚Äôve been hanging out every weekend for a month and I‚Äôve been trying to cut it off since after she let me hit on the first date. 

The problem is she‚Äôs an absolute smoke, and gives the most insane head. On top of that she lets me do whatever during sex. Even let me do anal on our second date. 

She‚Äôs definitely super into me and she usually initiates plans. And of course I don‚Äôt decline because horny and I don‚Äôt know when I‚Äôll find another girl like her sex-wise and looks-wise. 

So I slept over last night after we went for drinks and she made a comment about how she deleted her dating apps. I didn‚Äôt ask questions I just said oh that‚Äôs cool and then I dipped which she seemed upset about. And I think it‚Äôs at the point where it‚Äôs been a month and she wants to be exclusive meanwhile i‚Äôve been trying to get out since after the first time I was in (literally lol). 

If her personality didn‚Äôt make me wanna cut my ears off everytime she talked I would wife her. But she‚Äôs just annoying and honestly too ditzy to bare. Looks like barbie and acts like it unfortunately. 

What do I do? Should I end guaranteed low-effort, high quality sex?","You're an asshole. People like you who use people are the reason people lose trust in others. 

Imagine someone saying this about you. Someone you have been spending time with every weekend for a month. I would feel so extremely disrespected. But mostly if I was you, I would feel ashamed of the type of person I am. 

You're a big guy. Use your words. Be a fucking better person."
dating,147gz2r,2023-06-12 06:33:49,Can anyone suggest a subreddit that is specifically made for men who want to find a taller woman or to where the women can find a shorter man than themselves?,"I‚Äôm 5‚Äô11‚Äù 3/4 to 6‚Äô0‚Äù (182-183cms), so it‚Äôs a bit difficult for me to find a woman that‚Äôs taller than me, let alone a woman that would be okay with that sort of dynamic.


Also, I have no idea if this is an appropriate question for this sub, please tell me if it isn‚Äôt so.","I'm sorry what? Are you delusional?

Do you think there's a huge group of women out there who so desperately want to date men shorter than them that they made a subreddit for it?

dating,147gw4v,2023-06-12 06:28:47,Still Not Over Ex because We Stayed Friends,"It's been since December since I moved out and I am still not over my ex despite trying to move on. We go to the same dance studio and I see him almost every day. That paired with the fact that we are now neighbors and drop in on each other to chat frequently makes it hard to move on. He was over me long before our relationship ended (he admitted) but I tried to make it work till the end. I still find myself seeing this sliver of hope in us from time to time and still feel all these things come up from the past, good and bad, when we're together. I've tried the whole ""ignore him when I'm at the studio"" but it hasn't been successful.

dating,147gq52,2023-06-12 06:18:39,There is this girl I met online and I have no idea if she likes me.,"So as the title says I(24M) met a girl(21F) on an app called boo after a month we basically went out and I can say I was not really interested when I talked to her through chat but when I met her I really liked being with her.  
  
Her personality is tomboyish and she has a mouth like a sailor but I enjoy being with her a lot allthough we have actually gone out 4 times by now.  
  
I have no idea if she has any romantic feelings with me but She asked to meet my friends and we went to cinema together. She told me from the guys she has met I am one of the 2 guys that respect her and haven't tried anything like touching her inappropriately(she said someone grabbed her thighs when she went to watcha movie with him).  
  
She also basically went to the beach with me and I kinda met her step father and her mother and her sister and brother but long story short her father is trying to take the kids away but his is a drug addict and at one point she said ""Never become a man like that"" and I kinda took it as a sign but I have no idea.  
  
She said to me to tell her every time I want to go watch a movie because she is interested in going with me. Also she told me once that I am a friend and I took that as she wasn't interested in dating.  
  
There was a red flag when she didn't have money and I offered to pay for food for her and her brother and sister but she said she would give me the money back and she actually did so I am fine with that.  
  
No, idea how I should approach this but I can definitely say I like her and at the very least if she doesn't like me I can make a friend I enjoy being with.",
dating,147gk19,2023-06-12 06:08:29,Deciding whether to enter an LDR or not (F22 & M23),"For context, I‚Äôm currently an international student and we first met when I was on a holiday back in my home country and it was an instant attraction. He was working there for 6 months and was looking to explore the country so I offered to show him around while I was there. While it was only a 5 week trip, we met up every other day and there would always be so much laughter and passion between the both of us. We have a lot of things in common and we both said if we were both living in the same country, there would not be a doubt about being in a relationship.

Few weeks later after I left, we agreed to be friends because we couldn‚Äôt see a way to be together in the long run. It was difficult to remain as friends so we cut off contact for about 2 months and we recently got back into contact with each other when I felt comfortable with remaining as friends. The feelings that I thought would‚Äôve mellowed out however are still there and we both still want to be with each other. We both finish school around the end of next year and he doesn‚Äôt know where he would be in a year‚Äôs time. He is open to the idea of working in other countries including my home country but he has also mentioned he doesn‚Äôt want to pick his first job based on these circumstances which I completely understand. I have plans to work in the country where I am currently studying for at least 2 years or so and he unfortunately doesn‚Äôt see himself working here. I currently see three options for us 

a. an LDR and wait to see where he would work
b. keep in contact as friends
c. cut contact

I‚Äôm having a hard time thinking about what would be the best option for us, this man makes me feel so happy and I‚Äôm ready to give my all to make this work but I‚Äôm also scared that if we don‚Äôt work out I‚Äôd be extremely heartbroken, even with options b and c. Should I do an LDR or should I just give up? We would be having a call to talk about this but I would love some advice/opinion to think about before that. It‚Äôs a long post and if you read this much, thank you.

TLDR: met a guy, fell in love with each other but not sure if we should do an LDR.","I've been in a cross-country LDR as my ex went back to her home country after living in mine for 3 years and honestly it was extremely hard, we broke up after an year with a lot of hurt and heartache. So I would recommend you to cut contact and IMO LDRs aren't worth it."

I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs sort of my turn to ask him out? Or maybe I‚Äôve missed a cue? lol

I (25M) am in a long distance relationship with my Gf (22F) for almost 3.5 years not counting the time I knew before . I am from South East Asia and she is also from the same ethnicity but born and brought up in Europe. We met through this app called slowly where you can send  anonymous letters to people around the world . She found me in the app and thus began our journey . What started as a stranger to stranger penpaling went on seriously to us talking to each other for 100 solid letters . We never felt the need to share our numbers so to reduce the time taken by each letter to receive (the app takes time to send/receive letters based on the distance) we started e-mailing. That went on for quite some time . One fine day she fell sick , this was the time of COVID first wave , I shared my number in one of our mails saying if it was too hard to write a mail and wanna talk to somebody, ping me up . There was a radio silence for almost a week , I thought I took advantage and felt bad and a week after I got a message from a private message saying did you miss me ? When the whole world had to stay indoors and be alone , we found company of each other. Months went by where conversations never had an end . One fine day , 4 in the morning for me and middle of the night for her , we fell in love , thus started our journey of love. Our next plan of action on relationship , after COVID settles down,I move to her country for masters and lived happily hereafter. But things happened in my life where I was not able to pursue my dream of masters and had to stay back and start a business with my childhood friend. Yet , we thought we would figure something out for our future. We never really faced any problems in our LDR , we gave spaces to each other , kept in mind the time differences and even had Virtual dates . Fast forward to 8 months back , in a serious conversation we both acknowledged either one of us can't leave their family and move . It was the saddest moment in our relationship, yet we came up with a plan , to be with each other until either of our life become serious, as in till either of us was gonna get married . What started as a first step to a mature breakup went on to become ruthless and toxic fights this relationship ever saw , the day after we came to this decision, I started to notice changes from her , at first we started to spend less time , she said she is focusing more on her studies and then she went on partying and started to ignore me , she went on shaming me that I'm not happy for her or that I'm jealous that she is spending time with boys , yet after fights she comes back to console me , things have started to worsen up bad . Here I am middle of the night writing this trying hard to remember the last time I spoke to her . Not knowing what to do . Do I fight till the  end of time ? Or fast forward and end the relationship? 
Was I foolish enough to think to have a happy ending in the relationship?","Okay first off I have nothing against you being optimistic about thinking this girl is special. I get it, but what makes you think you can't move on from it?

There's a difference between being in a mutually invested relationship where the both of you actively work together to make things work, and where you confuse time invested with the prior option.

Fact 1) fights are becoming frequent/out of control
Fact 2) you are stuck long distance and can't have a proper relationship (ldr's suck for a reason)
Fact 3) she is ignoring you often
Fact 4) she's spending time with other men and she knows you aren't okay with it

She's she doesnt respect you and is either trying to push you to break up so she isn't the bad guy, or you are to unwilling to move on to women that may potentially make you much more fulfilled.

You got good relationship experience and for your age that's really good. Don't settle for something that isn't meeting you needs or requirements of what you want in a good relationship. You'd be surprised what you can live with, the longer you wait the worse it is."

dating,147fsuc,2023-06-12 05:23:48,What is my best course of action?,"There is someone (who will be nameless) who regularly asks me (and a friend of mine as well; as I have heard stories and been in the same room when it happens) to be in a relationship with this particular person.

For backstory, I met this person when I was about 1/2 way through high school (as I had recently changed schools, and regularly sat alone at lunch; right next to my locker [as it was at the end of the set]), as the stars seemed to align; and we hit it off as friends.
(As a note, the two of us; despite being in two different grades, we had roughly the same amount of time at high school [which is a story elsewhere for another time])
Eventually, this person asked me to be in a relationship; which (I will say was probably  the biggest red flag that I missed) stupid me jokingly said yes. As I see it now; it was more of as if a friend, best friend, and a friend with benefits came together as one than anything.
As time went on, I eventually went something like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe this‚Ä¶ us‚Ä¶ will work. Maybe as friends though.‚Äù 
It was about this point when it clicked that I made the right move (but not fully realized what possibilities may land ahead), because of what happened next.

Here is some of the things done (order maybe subject to some error from memory, modifications, or from other people) after we ‚Äúseparated‚Äù;

- a teachers aid getting into the conversation (which I felt was absolutely unnecessary, based on the situation)

-kissing other students of 2+ years younger than myself)

-getting other students involved in trying to get us back together (which I call the KC effect, but it is another story for another time)

-the occasional message that we should be in a relationship (roughly 1-2 times a month, +/- depending on the month)

That relatively catches up with the last 3-4 years.
I have said things to the messages like I‚Äôm not interested, I found someone else (even though I didn‚Äôt, and I do see that I was a douchebag on saying it), we should meet up and talk about it face to face (although that doesn‚Äôt go anywhere),‚Ä¶

I have blocked the number in the past, but unblocked it a few months ago to clear up the list, and it had started again.

To be fair, blocking doesn‚Äôt do any good (as I seen), and words seem to have no effect.
Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I am looking for that special person, but I don‚Äôt believe this person is that person; especially in my vision of the short and long term future.

Is there a path that I am not seeing? 

For privacy purposes, I am not naming people, and a few select things, because of privacy and I don‚Äôt know all the details and facts.

TL;DR I know someone who has the hots for me, and has for years; but not the other way around.

dating,147frs6,2023-06-12 05:21:55,Is it a bad sign to have been single all my life?,"26M. Since it matters, I'm mostly lean (BMI of 22). 5'7, and I have a beard. But I'm autistic and that, along with spending most of my life in a tiny rural town, has made understanding and practicing the dating process hard. I'm in college, but I have to work 30 hrs/wk which makes even hanging out with people difficult. I see people hold hands and hear people talk about sex all the time here and that makes me feel completely empty inside. And online dating is terrible. Tinder is the most used dating app, but that's only 7 million users in the US. There are over 330 million Americans. Even if you look good and have a good profile as a guy, chances are that you won't get a match that actually leads to something because most people don't use dating apps, and most who do don't take them seriously. Unless you live somewhere like NYC. I've been told I'm cute and handsome on dating apps, though I never got to on dates with those girls. I take my health very seriously- I lost 80 lbs from running and went 5 years without dessert or any drink beside water or milk. I've run up to 14 miles. If someone could give me an objective set of instructions leading to having a relationship I would follow it to the tee, but dating isn't like that, it's comoletely random and partly based on luck, which sucks.

I'm so tired of feeling lonely and hopeless that I'm undertaking a water fast for 4-5 months to get completely lean, so I can have better dating chances. It could be dangerous, but I'd rather do everything I can to be attractive to women than never find love. I'd rather have a relationship till 30 and die than just work like a dog and never have a relationship. Almost everyone I went to school with and go to college with has been/is in a relationship. In people's 30s, dating is basically a wasteland because everyone's married, so I feel like I'm fucked. Am I?",Just jerk off

dating,147fkct,2023-06-12 05:09:43,How to tell if this girl is interested,"After some small talk at the park I got this girls number. I text her & got no response in return. A week later by coincidence I see her at a stoplight and we talk for a bit then she messages me back for the first time. I offered her a date and she agreed but she is very spaced out with texting me back throughout the day while I try to get to know her and I mostly initiate conversation. Is this ‚Äúplaying hard to get‚Äù or something else? I‚Äôm new to dating, been in a relationship for 7 years so idk how things work now lol. 24 btw.","There could be a number of reasons why your experiencing her this way. Based off of what you said she could either be a really bad texter or she could only be casually interested. I‚Äôm surprised you met her in person, most people meet on dating apps.

Did you already schedule a date with her? If you have, you‚Äôll have to just wait and see if she follows through. If you haven‚Äôt scheduled anything yet then I‚Äôd suggest proposing two options for a date. You can try suggesting something on a weekday afternoon like grabbing a coffee and suggesting an alternative like getting a drink on the weekend. You giving her two different options with different activities is more than you want to extend yourself to someone for a first date. Depending on how she responds, that‚Äôll be your answer."

When he was sick I did the whole snacks, honey, tea, soup, and other stuff he liked/needed. Now I just want to surprise him with something. I‚Äôve done flowers once and he loved it. Did pizza and beer and it was the best. Is there something small that you guys would like to get as a little surprise? Or girls have you given something to your boyfriends randomly that they loved?

dating,147faxu,2023-06-12 04:54:52,How to date in this age,"I'm recently divorced. I'm a straight male by the way. I've been with my wife since I was 18, now 24. I've never been single as an adult. I definitely didn't make the first move when we got together either, and the reason is I'm very shy.

I'm not muscular, which is almost definitely part of the reason she left. She was overweight when we got together, but now goes to the gym religiously, has multiple muscular guy friends, is now in shape and can get whoever she wants, and is divorcing me. Obviously we've had problems and other factors that went into it, but I can't stop looking at that side of it. I'm pissed and sad, but also happy and excited in a sense.

Anyways... I dont know how to date. Like at all. Especially today when you can say one wrong thing and the other person is triggered and offended. The world is becoming a scary place, besides the fact that I've never really casually dated.

I'm also worried that a lot of women simply go for looks. Don't get me wrong, there are men that do that too. I think looks are important as well, but that is much lower on the list of important qualities in a person. I am on the other hand turning this divorce into motivation to go to the gym, but I still think dating someone for looks alone is shallow.

I'm scared guys. Give me some good pickup lines or something.",It's been six years. You're still a young adult. This is an unreasonable amount of panic. Sounds like you need therapy more than dating.
dating,147fat5,2023-06-12 04:54:39,Asked a coworker out,"Hello, 

TLDR;Gave a coworker my number and she sent no text.. what do I do now?

I male 23
Working at a summer school where I am the head of the middle schoolers 

Every summer we get an influx of new workers 
And this summer brought this one very shy but very cute girl and I was really invested (F22)

She seemed to have been staring at me but that‚Äôs easy to put into imagination 

My friend talked to her during a meeting group project and she seemed to be definitively glancing at me 

On one of our last meetings we were playing a game and she made some remarks to me towards the game and it was cute and chill 

Afterwards we start the summer and a week goes by of us talking 
Bc I check in on every class plus I give snack to every class 
And I tend to spend a little extra time with her even tho I technically wasn‚Äôt in her department (she works with 2nd grade)

On the following week we were talking and finished the list of anime we liked 

Then I asked to give her my number and she said 
‚ÄúYes. But I have a boyfriend. Wait I‚Äôm talking to someone‚Äù 

And gave me her phone to put my number in 

I did 

And she followed that by not texting me for an entire week 

We kinda glanced at each other and I just kinda did my job 

No more stopping for one more question work related or not. 

Do I still try? Do I just act cordially as I‚Äôve been doing? 

I kinda hope I have her the wrong number",She said she has a boyfriend. What's there to analyze?

A buddy of mine (not a close friend) was trying to flirt with her a lot of the evening but she said in front of a few of us she wasn‚Äôt trying to date right now. 


Then when we went out to a different bar she was kinda touchy feely and said she‚Äôd like to do dinner with me soon. The place she wants is kinda a romantic Italian dinner spot, pretty fairly priced. We danced a while at the bar and at the end of the night she said ‚ÄúOh we‚Äôre going to be great friends‚Äù but when she said it in what was a kinda flirty tone and she brushed her hand along my shoulder 


Never had this sort of interaction with her before 

She also said I have a wonderful smile and when she said it she kinda pinched my jaw


I messaged her saying I‚Äôd like to get together for dinner like she said and she said ‚ÄúAww you‚Äôre so sweet! Thanks _______ and that sounds great! Let me know when sounds good to you üôÇ‚Äù

I‚Äôve offered a time and date. I didn‚Äôt say it was a date as she hasn‚Äôt responded yet and she did also tell my buddy she wasn‚Äôt looking to date right now

dating,147f8le,2023-06-12 04:50:54,How can I (f25) tell if he (36m) wants something serious with me? New to dating,"
Context: I‚Äôve been seeing this guy once/twice a week for a month and I believe it‚Äôs going well. We‚Äôre getting to know each other. There‚Äôs little to no texting between dates.

I‚Äôve not dated before and don‚Äôt have many friends, so I‚Äôve never really constantly texted anyone in this kind of scenario so it never really bothered me. He‚Äôs got his kids for a few days every week and we meet when he‚Äôs free. I just assumed he‚Äôs busy, or that he‚Äôs not a big fan of texting like I am and prefers a face to face interaction.

However some of my friends believe his lack of communication or the lack of texting means he doesn‚Äôt want anything serious and that this is just sex to him or a distraction.

We have great chemistry, we have lots of interests in common, the conversation flows naturally, there‚Äôs no awkwardness, we enjoy each others company and he‚Äôs demonstrated he‚Äôs a mature, caring person and that wants to get to know me. We both have reached out to set a date. We both mentioned we‚Äôre after something serious before we met.

Even though we‚Äôve had sex, he‚Äôs not constantly asking for it nor is overly physical with me or trying to make a move in that sense. (So surely it can‚Äôt be all about sex if that‚Äôs not the main reason we meet?)

I‚Äôm confused as it never crossed my mind until someone else mentioned it and I‚Äôm unsure wether I‚Äôm being paranoid. Or whether I should clarify with him? Or should I just let things happen and flow naturally?

Hope someone can shed some light or help me out with some advice because I‚Äôm well clueless haha. 

Thanks!","Your answer is the second sentence. U want a husband who never texts u. He does the absolute bare minimum to keep boning u, while he‚Äôs busy messaging other women"

What are your thoughts?","So there's this guy in my Master's program, who I sit next to he seemed nice and approachable. I approached him asking for help 'cause he was smart and kind of cute but recently I found some stuff that made me uncomfortable through texts. I am not sure if these texts are not red flags? I feel like they are and I am always on edge when I receive a text. Because I'm an obvious overthinker, I anticipate things and most of the time, they turn out to be right. I have screenshots of these red flags (?) however, it seems that I am unable to upload them here on this thread but if anyone is down to lending me a helping hand in identifying these so-called red flags, that would be great. I keep talking myself out of it, that they might not be red flags due to HIS poor English skills.

The most recent text happened last night (a message about my gender verification, which is pretty obvious that I am a woman). I keep playing it cool by placing certain emojis/stickers. But, this certain text really did bug me, because why do I need to verify anyone who I am. It's none of his business. But, I didn't want to say anything, because we will be seeing each other a lot.

He seems to have a temper problem as well. We've been partners for presentations so I can tell he gets agitated easily. I want us to just stay friends but I feel like he wants something more. He's on 2 of my social media platforms and he's very active on them, constantly messaging me. It's quite annoying. He did ask me out on a date a few weeks back, but I said no, in a very vague way, because I work after classes and because I want us to stay friends instead.

Someone please help guide me on this issue I think is very complicated? Thank you! :)

dating,147evte,2023-06-12 04:30:24,It‚Äôs happened before,"This is more of a kind of vent for me but my chest really hurts when I think about it and I know the pain from a past experience. I‚Äôm currently in the military and I‚Äôm processing out of active duty and going home soon. 99% of my ‚Äúrelationships‚Äù or experiences have been while I was in the military, mostly these were just hookups because it was convenient and it carried no attachment. I only tried dating once and it ended with him cheating almost immediately after we got together. Fast forward to right now and I‚Äôm currently at a base processing out of active duty. I didn‚Äôt expect to really be doing anything here besides paperwork.

3 days ago I was invited to go hang out at a guys room just me and him. I thought why not? If it‚Äôs sex it‚Äôll just be a one off thing, and if there‚Äôs no sex I guess I‚Äôve made a new friend.

The amount of feelings I‚Äôve caught for this person is astounding. When we‚Äôve gotten together we spend pretty much the whole day with each other. We talk about life, we cuddle, we f***. And every time I leave his room I just feel sad because I know we have a limited amount of time with me leaving soon. We agreed to stay in touch when I go back home but I‚Äôm so scared that this‚Äôll all end up like most long distance situations. He is my 1 in a million person and I know it would take a lifetime to find someone like him that I connect with like I do with him. 

I sound kind of ridiculous to myself when I talk about someone I‚Äôve only know for a very short period of time. When I talk to him though, and when I look into his eyes, and when I kiss him; I feel like I could never want anyone else as much as I want him.

dating,147etb3,2023-06-12 04:26:26,What‚Äôs the right amount of effort in early stages?,"I‚Äôve had some great conversations with some people I‚Äôve met off apps, and I‚Äôm very straightforward and will speak my mind. 

Typically, I respond to messages as soon as I see them, so if I‚Äôm at work my replies will vary, if I‚Äôm off I might respond quickly, but if I‚Äôm training I‚Äôll be busy. 

I feel like it‚Äôs a constant balancing act of trying to not act too interested or people will just ghost me. I have so little expectation from anyone until we actually meet and they show even that level of commitment. 

In 6months of online dating, I‚Äôve met 2 women irl. 1 talked about herself nonstop and seemed genuinely psycho on the first date, so I quit talking to her. The 2nd wanted to come to my place and clearly just hook up even though I asked to take her to eat. She was a statue in bed and I genuinely lost interest in even having sex. 

I‚Äôm an above average looking guy irl and I genuinely don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing wrong. I would say I also have above average social skills because of my work. 

Should I just focus on only showing people the amount of effort they are showing me?","This is a tricky part of the early stages of dating...

Replying too quickly can make some women see you as needy, while others see you as thoughtful.

Replying too slowly can make some women see you as cool and independent, while others see you as an uninterested waste of time.

My advice here is to reflect what you're being served. If she takes a while to respond, you take a while... If she's responding quickly, and the conversation is building momentum, try to respond quickly. This approach may feel like you're 'playing games'... but I prefer to see it more as accepting human nature. Women are more likely to be attracted to you if you text them at a frequency in which they're comfortable.. and the best indicator of a 'comfortable frequency' is seen in how quickly / slowly they respond to you."
dating,147enp2,2023-06-12 04:17:44,why is she shocked?,"I got together with a girl for the 2nd time. We chilled the whole evening and night. I tried to escalate after around 3 hours of foreplay and petting to sex but she declined. 

I said it's ok but I need to go. She asked why I needed to leave and I told her that I wanted sex. If she doesn't, that's absolutely ok and I will not pursue further. 

But there are other women waiting for me already and I told her that I wanted to have sex. If not with her, then with another one of my friends. 

She began to cry and said ok let's do it, but I didn't want to anymore. She didn't really want it... 

Why did she cry when I made sure that I don't use her and leave when I didn' get what I wanted from her?","All I'm gonna say is you didn't handle any of this the right way. Don't say shit like that to a woman ever again, man. This one cried. The next one might punch you in the balls"
dating,147em5i,2023-06-12 04:15:21,Was I (M25) too harsh with this girl (F22) when I confronted her about our situation?,"Was I too harsh with this girl? Around 8 months ago, I matched with a girl on Hinge who lives in a different state. We spent time together, and even traveled to Europe where I have family. We share a similar sarcastic energy and get along well. However, I've been the one paying for everything, and some of her actions have been hurtful.

For example, when she visited my state, I booked a nice hotel for her. I had a feeling she didn't want me to stay overnight, so I asked her directly, and she responded with 'well is that rude?' I decided to let her stay at the hotel while I commuted back and forth between my hometown and the city, which was a 2-hour drive. Later, I discovered that she was still active on Hinge and even uploaded a selfie from the hotel room I paid for. When I confronted her, she apologized but was evasive, explaining that she wanted someone to talk to while being alone in a big city.

During our trip to Europe, where I covered all the expenses, my brother and his friends witnessed her ignoring me at a New Year's Eve party my brother organized. They saw her licking a guy's ear right in front of them. When I confronted her about it, she initially denied it and later claimed she didn't remember it happening. After we returned to the States, she started asking me for financial support for various things. Despite my warning about my own financial difficulties as a STEM PhD student, she continued spending money on clubbing and even used my funds for her best friend's outings. When I confronted her, she eventually admitted to everything and apologized.

While she may be sweet and sensitive, her constant reliance on my support and taking it for granted left me feeling used and hurt. Although we had an agreement not to see other people, we never officially became boyfriend and girlfriend because she claimed she wasn't ready and was evasive whenever I brought it up. Yesterday, I respectfully expressed that I couldn't handle the situation anymore and suggested we just be friends for the time being without exclusivity. In her response, she seemed genuinely sad, disappointed, and apologetic, which made me feel sad as well. Do you think I was too harsh in ending things abruptly? Should I have given her more space to talk before making this decision?","Based on what you've mentioned here, I feel you've made a great decision. And provided you handled the conversation respectfully, it certainly wasn't too harsh.

Her denying then misremembering licking a guys ear and being active on hinge from a hotel you paid for means you've got all the financial and emotional commitment of a girlfriend, without the basic expectations: loyalty and trust.

Downgrading to friends will be a great opportunity to see if she matures / how she feels about you... if she's sad because of how much you mean to her, or sad she no longer has your funds and affection at her disposal...) during this period, you can buy her the odd coffee or drink.. but do not give her money, and don't buy her any extravagant gifts."
dating,147ekpt,2023-06-12 04:13:10,Miss having someone,"I was in a relationship with my ex for 3.5 years before he dumped me to marry someone else. Going deep into that is like opening a can of worms so won't. In this rant, I just want to talk about the positives and what I miss.

I miss the feeling of companionship. When there's a strong friendship, it makes the relationship so much stronger and comforting as well. I turned to my ex for career advice, advice with family and friends, and a lot of other things. Having that level of intimacy where you have the freedom to say anything and everything without having the fear of being judged but just being listened to.

Even though the breakup was painful, at times, I have missed turning to him for advice and just venting to him. I have often asked myself in such situations - what would he say about this or what would he do? 

I am introverted and he is an extrovert yet in social situations, we would always agree upon when to leave a gathering. I miss looking across the room to find him and just convey through facial expressions - can we go home now?

When we lived together, I used to love cooking for him. I used to look forward to cooking something new or trying something new. Sometimes I would cook something different only to surprise him. I can now count the number of times I have cooked since we broke up. Doesn't feel the same and in general, I just lack the enthusiasm. I think I miss the look of surprise on his face and just the whole point of sharing a meal with someone you love.

I have tried dating and never really found that spark where someone would be more interested in the real me and not based on how I look. Feels nice to be complimented for looks but that is not everything for me. 

Sometimes having someone in life is such a blessing - we don't realize we are taking them for granted until they are gone.","Try loving yourself, get to know you and what you really love about yourself.

After 5 months I booked a solo holiday to Morocco, and to my surprise I crossed paths with her there. We started talking again, and have been talking for 2 months. It finally got to the point where I couldn't just keep talking anymore, so I asked her out, and she said she would only meet up if it was as friends.

I'm a bit heartbroken over this. Struggling to deal with it. I haven't responded to her text yet as I want to think before I reply. I do love talking to her, but I would always want something more.

The person I most recently talked to i lost interest in after seeing that their appearance didn‚Äôt match my preference.  

They continued to argue my point saying that you can‚Äôt like someone for personality but also have a physical requirement like having the person being shorter than you. In this case i just lost attraction because their hair was longer and they are a guy.

dating,147ecw3,2023-06-12 04:01:36,Fly 3 hours to meet and stay at someone I met at a festival,"I have not really dated in 4 years. I enjoy the single life. I am also not very sexual, so I have a fwb but strictly only for sex, no actual feelings. I go out a lot, meet different type of people, I get some attention and get asked out but I usually end up declining. Basically, I have not fell in love in 4 years.

I met someone at a festival, that is few states away from me. Around 6h drive, or 3h plane ride. We only partied for 2 days at the festival, but this is seriously the first time I felt my heart beat, and really enjoyed the presence of another man. I know yall going to say its the drugs, I mean maybe yes, but I have also done drugs in other parties, and never felt a crush this way.

I really enjoyed his confidence, his fun, but also in a way that was so pleasant to be with, respectful without being too much, not creepy, not seeking validation, and very safe. We only held hands and hugged but that was enough to make me keep looking back at him.

We text, and this is the most effort I have ever put but he only reads his text ONCE A DAY. He is always the one that randomly stops, and replies the next day....

I have been left on read already once in my text messages. Then he did not text me for a week. Then he replied to one of my stories, and we started messaging again until he left me on read since Saturday morning. I can't tell if there is flirting, he did not comment on my appearance, but he does seem pushing for a conversation. Invited me to go see some shows in his city. Also wants to go travel with me. He seems interested in my life, and hanging out again in his city buuuuut I am getting left on read since Friday again.

More than anything, I feel that it's such a desperate move as a girl to go visit a guy in their city and not being told that they are going to treat you out or anything or pay for something.

I mean I 100% get him because he does not even know me that well outside of those 2 nights of partying (we did not really hang out after, or during the day, other than a group lunch afterwards). We never had a proper 1 on 1 talk, only texting, and during partying. And I am taking a risk for flying 3h to go see him for 3 days.

My worst fears are : What if he is actually not my type at all while i am sober and not partying, what if he does not actually want to hang out with me all 3 days, but just wants me to go there to party one night and leave. What if he wants to stay purely friends, no sex at all, nothing. What if he actually has a girlfriend lol, or bunch of fwb and not interested for more, or he has a crush on another girl, or already has a rave bae. He is not 10/10, but I would say 7/10 looks. His personality boosts him to 8/10 and his party personality for me is 9.5/10 because this is the most fun I had a with a guy in a long time, and where I felt some kind of attraction. I am not surprised if he gets hit on by bunch of other girls too all the time because he gives a very trustworthy rave dad vibe but without the creepiness.

I don't even want a relationship because I don't really believe in LDR, I just want to enjoy his presence again, go party, know him more, maybe travel in the future.

I mostly want to go there to see if he is interested, to see if I am ACTUALLY interested in him, and if we are both interested then finally enjoy the thrill/rush/passion of dating which I missed so so so dearly, be official rave baes ? I don't like suspense, or being stuck in a limbo. I know this is stupid, but I enjoy taking risks, and do not want to have any regrets or let this chance of me finally falling in love go. At the same time, I don't know if he is interested in seeing me too, because he keeps on taking his time to text and just leaves me on read for 24h.

Curious on other guys opinions, and girls am I being completely irrational ?","Let me guess.. American woman in her 20s? single and ""living a full life"" in your 20s probably isn't the best choice, but have fun i guess. just don't expect to find a rich man in your 30s"

So, I immediately went on the dating app again. Met this beautiful, super educated woman who wants a ltr. We went on one date. It went great. We have another one next weekend. We're texting everyday for like an hour since the date. 

But I am still talking to the other casual woman. If I start dating the woman that I like more exclusively in the next few weeks, would that be wrong to have sex with the woman I like less looking that's looking for something casual this week?

I always thought it would be. But maybe others don't have those expectations these days? What are your thoughts?","Just keep your options open bro, you‚Äôre always just one text away from being ghosted by either of them"

You‚Äôre only leaving room for him to develop more feelings, and it sounds like you are either leading him on or keeping him as a backup.  The longer you wait in telling him that you are not interested romantically, the more likely that any friendship you have with him will be ruined."
dating,147e5dv,2023-06-12 03:50:22,Double texting,At what point is it too much? I‚Äôve always done it. Especially if it‚Äôs to confirm plans or ask to hangout. I get some people are bad texters or might be just using me for attention. But I literally double text everyone. Is that bad am I giving my self no respect? I have good self esteem. I am just persistent with people.,I honestly like getting double texts because it means the person is more engaged in the conversation.
dating,147e1il,2023-06-12 03:44:34,Why is this girl ignoring me?,"I don‚Äôt understand why in group settings, this girl completely ignores me? We have mutual friends but at this point we‚Äôve been on a week long international trip together with this group, played sports together, gone to dinner together, concerts together, hung out at each others‚Äô apartments, etc. 

I can make easy conversation with everyone else in the group and make eye contact with them. But this girl acts like I don‚Äôt even exist? And one time our mutual friend went to the bathroom and it was just us two and I could sense the awkwardness between us. 

I tried to make conversation and she acted like she didn‚Äôt hear and also replied with very few words. It was fucking painful. I‚Äôm usually pretty charismatic but damn lol. 

Does she maybe think I‚Äôm interested in her or something? We‚Äôre both the only two single ppl in the group. But she knows I‚Äôm on hinge and talking to like 50 women rn?? So idek at this point. 

I haven‚Äôt done anything against her to warrant this kind of reaction. She‚Äôs very outgoing and bubbly with everyone else in the group. And don‚Äôt say she likes me cause she legit never makes eye contact and acts like I don‚Äôt exist and is the only one in the group that doesn‚Äôt laugh at my jokes.

Who else struggles with feelings of inadequacy? I was in a relationship for 12 years and it ended with him cheating on me with a younger woman. I then dove headfirst into a purely-physical relationship before becoming chronically single (8 years and counting). I‚Äôm in my mid-30s now and struggle to see why anyone would like me. I know it has nothing to do with reality, and everything to do with the fear of being ‚Äútraded in‚Äù again. I thought I knew my ex like the back of my hand, and if I didn‚Äôt really know him - how can I ever know or trust anyone again? I‚Äôm very happy single, but it‚Äôd be nice not to be so down on myself in regards to seeing myself as a potential partner to someone.","Just be your self

If you find yourself being excessively annoyed with the small things he does it might be connected to a bigger underlying issue in the relationship. Maybe it's just the ick. You guys are still young, and it's okay to not know how you feel. Make sure you honestly communicate those feelings with your partner in a way you're both comfortable with."

what can I possibly do other than leaving the US?","I am an Asian male and felt the same way.  

I changed everything about myself. Western women like fitter and independent men.  
So I invested a lot in my food, fitness and my clothes. 
The fashion we follow in Asia won‚Äôt fly here, get clothes which the west accepts.  

Then do things where western women hangout. Like gym classes, climbing, yoga etc.

To start, I‚Äôm 20 and I‚Äôm in the army. (This will make the next pill a little easier to swallow) I am also very recently divorced. She is also 20 and in the army. We were high school sweethearts. I have been putting allot of work into myself in the past 3 months (being the time since the divorce) and no matter what I feel like I‚Äôm making a huge mistake not chasing after her. Im sure that‚Äôs normal but I guess that‚Äôs for all of y‚Äôall to tell me. Either way, I‚Äôve barely been in contact with her. Towards the start of the divorce I sent a few drunk texts nothing out of spite or anything crazy. The real chase here is I feel like I‚Äôm standing at a crossroads between trying to restart my marriage, trying to date again, getting into hookup culture, or just doing me for a while. 

To be honest, the latter option seems best but also the most disheartening for me. I love allot, even with my job. Going without somebody is a scary proposition for me. The second worst for me is definitely dating again. I am long out of the game, I have gotten laid since the divorce but mostly because the girl found me extremely attractive (I‚Äôm like a 6 on a good day) and made out with me so aggressively I couldn‚Äôt even talk. I SUCK at talking to women. 

If y‚Äôall have anything to help me out here it would be greatly appreciated, if not I guess I‚Äôll just leave this here as a vent lol.",Why did you divorce?

At times I do get matches and have met up with people in the 4 years I've been single but today i realised when swiping through people that surely I should be getting more matches? Even when it tells me people have viewed my profile they don't match and I just can't get my head around it... And it's not just that I'm liking the wrong type of people as I don't have a type so I like a whole range of different types of profiles. I see myself as a good looking guy so I don't think that's the issue and I must be coming up when people are swiping so what are the chances everyone just thinks ""no"" when they see my profile. I don't ever really get likes at all tbh, it's usually that I just get matches sometimes when I've swiped yes on them. It really does mess with my head as i just keep thinking what could be the issue? am I actually ugly but I'm not seeing that or what lol because to me I feel like I have some nice pics and I do love myself for the person I am.

dating,147dji1,2023-06-12 03:17:18,I fell for a FWB. How do I move forward?,"I'm a man (30) and I'm into men. I'm focused on finding a serious relationship but in the gay realm, not many people my age are looking to date seriously or exclusively, and hook up culture is huge.

I date around to no avail, but still crave the sex and connection so I dabble in hookups occasionally. I connected with a great guy, and after the third night we spent together, I realised I have pretty strong feelings for him after I left his place. To me he's ideal. Smart, sexy, funny, caring, great career and experienced. 

He mentioned being boyfriends may be an option in time (we've only met 4 times in 5 months) and that he wouldn't want to be exclusive if we got there (we're both tops and open to the idea of an open relationship to fulfill our sexual needs). At this point, I find myself thinking about him a lot. Fantasizing and bummed out that we're not dating seriously. Something needs to change for my mental health to be sustainable.

Either I re-learn to see him as a friend, as was intended from the start, or I break it off with him so I can get heartbroken and then start recovering to remove this source of anxiety. I'd be throwing away a really good connection. I'm not sure what route to take, ideally I want him around in my life, but I also want my heart to stop falling for him. Any advice?",

She was surprised(i could not tell if there were any  other emotions). We texted, turns out she is quite an **introvert** and mostly it was me who started the conversations. Initially she said she wanted to settle down first before going into relationships, but then things got interesting, **as I stopped talking to her, she would ask me if I still like her**? This happened twice, and me being inexperienced always replied in the affirmative without actually figuring out what was her real motive. Sometimes I would get a little obsessive over her asking her why she would freely talk to some people and not me who actually confessed his feelings for her.  Gradually in the 4 months till now she opened up little by little to me, told me about her strengths, her obsessions. **She would be super responsive one day and then would not reply or give short replies the other day.** On the last day before vacation I called here but she did not pick up then when I texted her she said she would talk the next day, it has been 3-4 days and she has not texted back anything despite her being online in her socials.

Worst part of dating for me is having to tell my ""story"". I've learned though that the last 5 years are truly relevant and the next 5 are paramount in understanding where you are going.

dating,147d1tc,2023-06-12 02:51:47,Feeling weird about what happened at a party (18M) (18F),"So I was at a party a few days ago. And there was a girl there that I know, we‚Äôve got a lot of mutual friends but we‚Äôre not like super close. We talk sometimes but not a lot if you get what I mean. 

Anyways, at this party she was talking to me a lot. And a lot of what happened was really weird and sudden. For example, she demonstrated to me with her hands ‚Äúproper bj technique‚Äù as a joke which was kind of out of pocket, and also (I don‚Äôt remember exactly what was said so I‚Äôll paraphrase) something like ‚ÄúI‚Äôd need to use 2 hands for you‚Äù (in reference to what she said above). 

Then we went to my friends house after this party. There were a few of us there. We all spent a good amount of time talking about random stuff and she said something to me like ‚ÄúI never knew (my name) was so chill, and something about how friendly I am‚Äù. Again, my mind was fuzzy so I don‚Äôt remember exact words. 

After that, we all slept on my friends bed, I‚Äôm not sure why, it‚Äôs just what happened. It‚Äôs really small. The thing is, she was spooning me for some reason. I was sleeping on my side and she‚Äôd keep backing into me. And this happened repeatedly. At first I thought I was accidental, so I‚Äôd back away, but she‚Äôd just back into me. I wasn‚Äôt able to sleep either, so this happened for the entire 8 hours of me laying there. She‚Äôd get up to ‚Äúreadjust‚Äù or grab a blanket or something and would purposely sit on my lap for a few seconds. 

She also was awake for most if not all of this. At one point she asked me if I wanted to get a snack with her downstairs, and I said yes. And she kept bumping into me and stuff like that the entire time. 

I‚Äôm not stupid, and was almost certain that she wanted me to do something. But,  I felt really weird about a lot of it (especially how quickly it started). Also, I honestly don‚Äôt have a lot of experience with stuff like this so I kind of let it happen. I also was afraid of reading the room wrong or a bunch of other things. Along with that I‚Äôve never had feelings for her, even during all of that. 

Later that day, I hung out with my friends and somehow they already knew about this. They were joking about how I should have shot my shot and that I ‚Äúcould have got some‚Äù. What do I do?

Basically, I have only 2 questions.

1) Does it seem like she was actually into me? 

And that‚Äôs important for my second question, 

2) How do I act next time I see her? Originally, i believed that I should just act normal and be friendly and pretend that nothing happened , however my friends are making me second guess myself. 

I don‚Äôt want to start any kind of drama. 

Also important to note, there were certain substances at this party. 

TLDR: Not sure how to act towards someone after a party. Advice?",

So I (31F) was supposed to hang out with my neighbor (42M) last Saturday. I ended up texting him while drinking the Thursday before and we drank at his house. I definitely drank too much and convinced him to open up his hot tub for us (I got in in a sports bra and yoga pants ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è).

Most guys like it when a woman initiates but if you hit it a bit hard especially early after a big breakup it can come across as a bit desperate. Just back off a bit. Go out a few times. Don't try and get him into your pants. Just have some fun times and feel him out. If he knocked you back for a drunken make out session he might just not be into you that way hard as that may be to hear.

He loves me and never forces me to do anything but he‚Äôs obviously hurt after being rejected so many times. I keep going back and forth in my head trying to figure out what‚Äôs wrong with me. I have two trains if thought, either A) we‚Äôve been in a relationship for so long that it‚Äôs normal for the sex between partners to slow down. Maybe this is just the normal progression for long term relationships. Or B) and I not sexually attracted to him anymore and this problem will never be fixed.

dating,147cnls,2023-06-12 02:31:17,Being a virgin has been the biggest cockblock of the century,"I suppose I‚Äôm looking for guidance on how to navigate this. I have been looking for a boyfriend for quite some time (22f), but for some reason or another I have a hard time with connecting to people in general, especially men. I have been trying to date for a few years and every man I have told my virginity status to has ghosted. I don‚Äôt consider myself religious and I‚Äôm not necessarily waiting until marriage. I have tried a variety of tactics that include telling them or not telling them but when the ball drops they never stick around. I am considered attractive so everyone around me is confused on how I‚Äôm still single and recently my family accused me of being a closeted lesbian.  Please tell me this is normal I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing wrong.

Edit: I‚Äôm shocked at the reception this post has received, I will go through everyone‚Äôs comments when I get back from work. I greatly appreciate the time everyone has taken to help me out.

Edit: okay to answer some questions people have asked. 

1. Yes most of these men are from apps, my workplace is 98% women and although I do go outside most of my hobbies involve staying indoors like taxidermy and botany , dress making, baking etc I do like outdoor activities like kayaking and such but I am in the wilderness, unless I see Bigfoot I would see no men. I‚Äôm generally not approached by men but my friends say I look intimidating. I have recently moved to a smaller town (US) that is mostly white and traditional and I‚Äôm mixed Panamanian.Also I know I‚Äôm not ugly! My previous job was a bottle girl. I was propositioned a lot there but only by sleazy gross guys. 

2. As far as having a strange personality, maybe. I was not diagnosed autistic but I may have markers. I am very good with making female friends, I don‚Äôt have any guy friends at the moment but when I did they all just simply wanted to sleep with me before actually being a ‚Äúfriend‚Äù. I think the only reason they kept me around was the opportunity to sleep with me so it felt very predatory to me. As of now I have no guy friends. 

3. For some reason people think I‚Äôm against masturbating, I‚Äôm not.  I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm frigid or sexually stifled in any way. 

4. I‚Äôm looking for a bf not a hookup but if I like the guy and things don‚Äôt work out it‚Äôs not a bd. My first rule is I actually have to like them. why would I sleep with someone I don‚Äôt like or is a stranger to me? As far as dating out culturally I‚Äôm apprehensive about, due to some misogynistic cultures.

5. For now I‚Äôll take the advice to just wait and stops using dating apps. I‚Äôm not around much men in my day to day life so I‚Äôm not sure how I will actually meet them. Also to not bring the virginity thing up until we‚Äôre absolutely close.","As a 32 year old male, here is some advice for you:

1. You will never please 100% of the people you meet in society. So stop trying.
2. Do not give up your virginity just to seek a man's validation. You will meet plenty of great guys who see it as a good thing.
3. There will be plenty of handsome young men, with a great personality to match, that are out there for you.

dating,147bzoe,2023-06-12 01:58:34,Did I blow my (23M) chance with my cousins (26F) friend ?,"So last night I (23/M) went out to a bar with my cousin (26/F) and her friends. I go out with them occasionally for birthdays or other events but I rarely interact with her friends. 

My cousin has a friend, Megan, who she‚Äôs been friends with for basically her whole life and even my family knows who Megan is. I see her every once in awhile and last time I saw her was a year ago when she was dating some guy. 

At the bar last night we were all in a little circle and dancing and singing to the music. Probably about 6-8 of us. Megan started dancing with me and grabbing my hands while we danced and sang to different songs. I didn‚Äôt think anything of it but then eventually she asked if I wanted to get a drink at the bar and I said yes so she grabbed my hand and lead me to the bar and bought us a shot and beer. And then she did the same thing with my hand after we got our drinks and walked back to where everyone was. And then later we got another drink on me so I grabbed her hand and lead her to the bar and back to our circle. 

I was pretty drunk and I didn‚Äôt go into the night planning to make a move on her but after telling my friends about her grabbing my hand and stuff they said I blew my shot. I feel like an idiot now lol because I totally would have kissed her. I wasn‚Äôt sure if she was just being nice to me since she‚Äôs a good person or just trying to have fun .


TL;DR: my cousins (26/F) friend grabbed my hands to dance and to lead me (23/M) to the bar last night and I‚Äôm not sure if she was interested in me. My friend said I blew my chance. But I am unsure if grabbing my hands and dancing with me meant anything.",Hav u tried the cousin ?

dating,147bj0n,2023-06-12 01:35:46,"23M still single, no glue what to do","Well, yes, i‚Äôm on a certain point of my life when i don‚Äôt find it normal to be single, and not only single, but deeply lonely. Don‚Äôt know what to do, and in need of some concrete advises in how to approach, how to find, how everything with girls. As nothing goes natura in my case (by itself)l, and advises like ‚Äúit will come by itself, yo don‚Äôt have to do anything‚Äù doesn‚Äôt work, i‚Äôm feeling that i‚Äôm in a deep mud with this, and at the same time living is becoming hell.

Well, here is my quick story, to make a little clearer of my problem.

I‚Äôm 23yo male. Born in very poor russian family, spent most of my time studying and working, got literally no social life till finally managed to escape military draft and came to study in spain in 2021. Here i faced a terrible reality that i‚Äôm like 10 years late in social skills with the rest of the pple of my age. I still struggle with it, but at least have some progress. Than came war that changed my life and life of my family in so many ways, that i closed myself very, very deeply, till my medication started to work, than i finally got my permission to work as a refugee, and here i am right now: mentally exhausted from last 7 years of hell, but finally with a job, my university studies and stable documents. But the problem that came with me through out all thia years is mu completely loneliness.

Even if i didn‚Äôt have much of a social life, i always tried to find someone, and always got rejected. I didn‚Äôt count them, but let‚Äôs say 15-20 times. And i‚Äôm not talking about some ‚Äúone night adventures‚Äù that i‚Äôm not interested in, but some potential partner, to be on a one wave, to be really interested in one another. In another words, i‚Äôm much of pansexual, rather than hetero.

And right now i‚Äôm facing a brutal reality, where i‚Äôm 8-10 years late in all that dating/relationship stuff, with no experience about how it works and no glue how to find someone, and at the same time have little free time outside of the job and studies. The feeling of loneliness is eating me from the inside, and it is even worse, realising that i‚Äôm thousands km away from my family with no possible way to see them in months, if not years. I really need a partner to start building relationship, to make deep connection between, and damn, i have literally no idea HOW.

To describe a little bit myself: depending on tastes can be rather 6/10 or 8/10, not stupid, but struggling with social interactions. Overthinking all the time, better say, never stop thinking, and aleays think a lot evwn before some small decisions. In some way pple find me funny (most of my style of talking, accent and mimic‚Äôs), but also very concentrated in work and solving problems, which is often confused with lack of empathy. Also i‚Äôm aleays too direct and honest, that can also intimidate pple or even scary them. 

-dating apps result useless
-friends mostly invite me to other groups of people, where girls are either taken, or not interested in serious relationships
-those girls who reject me just say that they are not interested in me as in a partner
-popular advises ‚Äújust wait and it will come‚Äù and ‚Äúyou will find it when you don‚Äôt search for it‚Äù is a crap of advise. I know several people who are close to their 50‚Äôs and still nothing. The one who has problems is me, not the world, and i‚Äôm willing to change things and not just ‚Äúwait‚Äù
-it would have been a good idea to socialize in some places like dancing clases (and i‚Äôm planning to do it in future), but even if i found someone who is interested, How do i make it? 

If you can give some advises, or have some similar case, i would be glad to hear them. Thanks!",

dating,147bh8p,2023-06-12 01:33:22,7 year slump,"So due to some struggles with my mental health (anxiety+depression) I haven't hooked up with anyone in a verrry long time (7 years). Before my hiatus, I was pretty much always in a relationship or at least could manage ta hook up with someone given I had enough alcohol in me. After getting sober I figured I'd take some time away from pursuing sex and relationships, but what ultimately happened was I ended up isolating and avoiding women in general. 

Now I'm at the point where I've been in therapy for a couple years and have been focusing on increasing my self-esteem/confidence and my instinct to avoid seems to be decreasing. This feels like a pivotal moment in my life and it's something I haven't even discussed with my therapist yet, but I think I really wanna try to step outside my comfort zone and at least put myself out there. 

Keep in mind I'm pretty out of touch considering all my friends are in relationships, so my knowledge of dating is limited to media. I just want to clarify that while I eventually want to date in hopes to have a long term partner and my philosophy is along the lines of finding a best friend that I also happen to be in a relationship, that's not what I'm lookin for right now. I'm just looking for a frictionless fun thing, not in an attempt to fill a void (maybe it still is in a away) but just to pop this massive bubble that I've built up all these years.

That being said I have a tinder and think that's probably the easiest barrier to entry. I just don't know where to start. I know I probably *should* pump the breaks and get to a point where having love for myself is more of a fact than a question, but at the same time I know I'm the kinda person who keeps pushing the goalpost as a sort of avoidant procrastination so I'd rather jump in the deep end. Plus I'm starting to accept that people don't need to be the perfect version of themselves in order to have imperfect sex with other imperfect people.

I mean I really don't even like the idea of hookup culture and practicing what is essentially using eachother for sex, but as far as I've heard that's what the majority of ppl on tinder are there for so maybe it's less of a big deal than I think.

So I guess what I'm asking is how should I move forward with this? Are there any expectations I should/shouldn't have? How much of this should I divulge in whoever I end up pursuing? I have a fear that I'll come across as disparate and creepy if I lead with anything even remotely close to what's essentially ""I haven't had sex in years pls have sex with me"" lol. Are there any red flags that I should be looking out for, so maybe I don't get taken advantage of? I've pretty much accepted that I'm initially going to be a nervous wreck even just socializing, but I'm pretty confident that if we connect I can loosen up and be my genuine self. When it comes to dating apps specifically what's the general timeline look like. Not to assume this to be a standard transactional kinda thing, but on average for people who have had a lot of luck is it like a few days of chatting, then a date, then maybe more if it goes well? Are formal dinner dates expected or is a casual date/meetup acceptable?

Ok I reallllly don't even want to post this, but I need to keep moving forward so I don't slip back into my avoidant behavior. So please lemme know if ya got any advice; even if ya just wanna cherry pick one of those questions I'd appreciate it. Tyia","Just go for it. You don't need to be perfect, no one is. It will get easier with practice

Every person is different, so their expectations will be different. If you're looking for casual, pursue that."
dating,147b95b,2023-06-12 01:22:20,Boyfriend and I have some really big issues,So I 30F been with my boyfriend a year 45M. Everything was awesome till about 3 months ago. Now we barley have a conversation about anything. He started dating another women. She loves a hour away. It's really hurt me. Then last night I caught him hollering and another chick. Then found her number written down. Since we been together and problems have started I've let myself go. Extremely depressed. He makes me happy im  truly in love with him. I don't think he feels the same. I think I should leave him. He tells me hell find me no matter where I go. Im his for life... Idk what to do..,"This dude sounds like a POS.

1. He's started dating someone else.
2. He's speaking to other women on the side.
3. Doesn't reciprocate your love.
4. Says ""he'll find you, no matter where you go. Your his for life."" Which sounds like a threat to me.

Also your mental wellbeing is in jeopardy from everything he's done. It seems to me he's controlling and manipulating you and I really think you should find away to get him out of your life.

You say he makes you happy but he and his actions are the exact reason you are unhappy. Forget him."

Feeling kind of down because I (26M) thought things were going really well between me and a girl (23F) I've been dating for almost 2 months but when I asked if she wanted to keep dating she said she wasn't sure and that she would let me know in the next two weeks. To me, this is a rejection because if she was really feeling the connection she would have said yes without hesitation. All the while I can't help but wonder if it's be self conscious and analyze all of my flaws. Is it my lack of personality, bad conversational skills, my weight, or all of the above? Can't help but feel like she's just waiting for someone better. 

I'm going to be honest, I'm a bit disappointed. She said that dating me is a definite plus in her life and that she has enjoyed our time together and would miss it if things didn't work out. 

Honestly, after this might stop trying to date and work on myself for a few years. I finally get somewhere with a girl and just my luck, she's unsure about me.

We had a previous disagreement in the day that ended in him grabbing his g*n saying something along the lines of he wanted to kill himself and then left and proceeded to go grocery shopping. 

(For more context with what was just said i unfortunately can not tell Reddit what his occupation is, but due to his occupation I have never felt my life being in danger by his hand or in his presence. Very comforting for myself.) 

Background on me (s), I have suici**l tendencies, I attend therapy, I am medicated, and I do have a good support system. I don‚Äôt take things like that as jokes what so ever.

He gets home and acts as if nothing has happened, nothing was said, and everything is fine. Make/eat dinner he goes to take a nap so I sit next to him and an hour or so goes by and he rolls over and holds me, I move as if I‚Äôm getting up. J says ‚Äúare you serious right now, I can‚Äôt even touch you‚Äù and I say ‚Äúwell are you going to apologize to me for the hurtful words you said to me before leaving? What if the rolls were reversed‚Ä¶ what if I said that‚Ä¶ grabbed the g*n‚Ä¶ and just left? Would you appreciate that being done to you?‚Äù And I walked into the kitchen, took a drink of my sprite, walked back into the bedroom and no sooner than I sit down he gets up, grabs the comforter and his pillow and proceeds to lay on the couch as if he would sleep the night away. 

I need a sane individual to tell me how I approach this‚Ä¶? 
Am I in the wrong? 
How do I get J to understand what I feel he did wrong?

dating,147ahd5,2023-06-12 00:45:05,I don‚Äôt feel like a priority,"I‚Äôve been dating my SO for about 4 months. While things are consistently fantastic when we hang out, I feel like recently he‚Äôs been declining my offers to hang out more than usual. I don‚Äôt see this as an obvious red flag, but it does bother me. Like how much we want to see each other doesn‚Äôt match. Sometimes he is busy when I make plans, other times he just wants to stay home and be alone.

Again, not a huge red flag. But it does feel like a mismatch of our expectations of each other, or of our preferences. Am I overreacting? Is he just being mature and prioritizing his personal time alone over a SO? Am I being too needy?

dating,147ah4k,2023-06-12 00:44:48,Men: what was the moment you realized you wanted to be more than friends with a close girl-friend.,"To elaborate: if you had a good friend who was a girl and one day something clicked and you realized you wanted her to be more than a friend, what was the reason? Was it something she did or said? In general, are there things that a girl could do that would make her girlfriend status instead of just a friend?","Well tbh It was just the vibe yk. I met her almost 1 year ago in uni we were at the same project group. At first I thought of her like a good uni friend, the type of friend you talk about projects or talking about the exams but nothing more. In the semester break we once went partying with common friends and start talking about everything except uni and it was so natural and we had so much in common it was scary we both thought lol why didn't we talk more. I kinda crushed on her at that night but after that I crushed even harder, she genuinely reads my mind and idk how. For example I kinda feel sad about a family thing but didn't bother to talk so someone in the middle of the night she called me and said something like: hey I kinda notice u were off today is everything fine? I never had that because I normally can hide my emotion pretty well. After that I felt for her"

dating,1479s23,2023-06-12 00:11:13,"Should I give him another chance, or am I his second choice?","Me and a guy slept together earlier this year. We were never serious, but I got the impression that we were both interested in each other, because we both made a big effort. We didn't know each other very well, and we had a maximum of 1-2 normal conversations, while the rest of our conversations were only flirting and small talk. I also made a mistake, because I gave very mixed signals. E.g. I mostly wanted to flirt and have small talk; I would never speak to him first: I left quite early in the morning; I ignored him once by looking at him and then looking away. And after I ignored him, we didn't speak for 1 month.

Anyway, after 1 month, I finally had the opportunity to talk to him again. And he flirted with me (winked at me, bought me a drink, said we should see each other later while staring deep into my eyes, etc.) so I thought he might still be interested. He didn't come up to me anymore and was distant, but I thought it was just because he wanted me to chase him, and show him that I'm actually interested. This went on for 1 month.

But then I went to a party, and there I found out he was with someone else. I confronted him and he said that ""No, technically they weren't together, but only exclusive."" They had become exclusive not too long ago (that is, not while we were sleeping together). Anyway, I said that I felt he had lead me on, because he hadn't told me he was exclusive, but he said he was just trying to have a ""friendly"" conversation with me and that he was trying to politely reject me. He said it would have been different if I had shown interest earlier this year, but now he was with her.

I wondered how serious they were and he made it very clear that he was going to be exclusive with her now, but he didn't know what would happen in the future because she was an exchange student who was going home soon. This sounded very unserious to me. I said I felt he was keeping me warm until she went home, and that he then intended to be with me after she left. He denied this. He said if it wasn't her it would be me.

Anyway, she's gone home and it's over between them, and he says he wants another chance. He said that since I mixed signals, he went for someone who made her interest obvious. And by the time I showed interest, he was already with her. In addition to this, they lived in the same student residence, so he knew her much better than me. As I said, most of our conversations were short, small talk or flirting; we had very few real conversations, so we didn't know each other very well.

I don't quite know what to do. I know I messed up, but should I give him another chance?

Am I his second choice?",Leave him alone
dating,1479q80,2023-06-12 00:08:46,Is dick size why this keeps happening?,"So I'm a relatively big, slightly muscular black guy. And I'll be dating these girls, and everything will be fine. They'll really, really like me. And then, suddenly, it takes a turn. And they break up or start picking at things that weren't a problem before.

I was seeing this pattern, and I was trying to figure out the common denominator...and I noticed that this always happens within 24-48 hours of when we get to the stage when they feel or see my dick.

I don't have a micropenis, but it's smaller than you might expect given stereotypes of my appearance. I'm a grower, and fully erect it's 5.5 long and 4.25 around. Not erect it's less than half of that, usually.  But it'll happen...we start getting handsy, start making out, things get hot and heavy...then they feel my dick. And they won't say anything in the moment, but after that...everything changes.

It's the same regardless. Say nothing and they'll say nothing, but the dynamics change. Warn them it's not big and they'll say they don't care, and be convincing when they do it...but still, the dynamics change afterwards then, too.

It goes this way about 90% of the time.

And I'm traditional, naturally. Like I'll be getting attached before that point. So it's tough when the dynamics suddenly begin to change within 24-48 hours of that moment, like clockwork.

Should I...prewarn these dates earlier somehow so I don't keep coming out scarred and we get it out the way earlier?

Edit: I guess my main question is -- is this a thing? Will most women disappointed by averagish dick size not say so because that would be politically incorrect, and instead look for another ""reason"" to break it off that's more politically correct?

Edit2: Wow, thanks for all the feedback. Much more than I was expecting. It is doing a lot for my confidence and reassuring me that this is probably something that, in most cases, I can do something about.

Half of the guys think it is a size thing, it looks like. Half of the guys think it's not. Most girls genuinely seem to think, to my surprise, that it has nothing to do with size, although some do. Main advice is that as long as I focus on pleasing her first and don't put up any other red flags, I should be OK. I just need to go out there with confidence. Sure some women will be disappointed, but if they like me for me I'll be fine with most women.

And I should look at other things -- hygiene, apartment condition, what she says is the issue and -- above all -- making her cum without being selfish about it.

There is no way I could have gotten this much honest feedback IRL, especially without facing severe stigma. This community is amazing; thank you.

Edit3: I am not shaming anyone for their preferences. I have my own politically incorrect preferences and stereotypes, so it'd be hypocritical. Just looking for honest answers.",That‚Äôs a totally normal dick size it sounds like they are fetishizing you and expecting to see the monsters they see in porn expecting all black guys to be hung like a horse like that.

If he and the mother live pretty far apart, the logistics of getting the kids to school and back and forth between parents could be really difficult and so the kid of schedule you mentioned might be in the best interests of the kids and have nothing to do with what kind of person the dad is.

Or the mother could have been very difficult to deal with and insistent on having the kids throughout the school year and he ran out of money to fight the legal battle and just gave in.

I've worked with a number of lads on the spectrum, and so I certainly understand the challenges that come with dating as an autistic man... these include: not being able to read social cues naturally, thinking very logically (which is especially hard because oftentimes, dating defies logic), not knowing how to behave in a way that isn't pushy, but also isn't too reserved.... Now, I'm not trying to assume all your challenges, and I know that autism is different for many different people... I'm just generalising.

Here are a few tips:

\- Be yourself... but in a socially considerate way. What I mean by this is: Don't be afraid to be open / vulnerable / discuss your strengths and weaknesses... but also, anytime you're about to reveal personal information, (especially in the beginning stages) ask yourself: ""Is she likely to appreciate my honesty here, or is what I'm about to say more likely to make her feel uncomfortable""... A lot of men (particularly those on the spectrum) over-share in the beginning stages of dating, and it deters women. I'm not saying you should be dishonest with women either, but rather: some information about yourself requires rapport / and a connection to form before it's appropriate to reveal.

\- Meet women in places that align with your interests. A lot of guys think: ""I'll meet girls at nightclubs, cos there's always heaps of women in nightclubs""... but if you HATE nightclubs, the women you meet will see you as bored and unhappy.... Try this exercise: write down 5 hobbies / interests, and for each one, come up with 2 places you could meet women through these interests...

Examples:

Basketball: Through a mixed-sex basketball league, at pro basketball games

Comic books: fan forums and comic book events

Photography: Join a photography club or attend photography workshops and exhibitions.

Cooking: Take cooking classes or attend food festivals and culinary events.

\- Practice active listening. A lot of men think that the secret to great conversations with women is to ask heaps of questions and get her talking about herself... but they don't practice HOW to listen properly... and as a result, women don't see them as genuinely engaged in the conversation... Active listening teaches you to ask interesting questions, make the right verbal prompts to encourage her to continue speaking, and to ask questions that progress the conversation in a natural way.

\- Focus on creating friendships with women. This may seem like I'm saying: ""Go get friend-zoned by a bunch of women"".. but actually, the point of this is that when you go in with the intention of friendship, you're more likely to be confident / natural / relaxed in the company of women... this makes it easier for romance to form. (there's more to this.. if you want some more tips / to clarify anything I said, send me a message.)"

We clicked instantly but are both quite busy with work and both of us starting up school again soon. I‚Äôve never been in a real relationship ship, and I‚Äôm also incredibly awkward with very poor social skills. I‚Äôm not good at starting conversations and sometimes I just don‚Äôt know what to say, so I start get nervous and just say nothing. He, on the other hand, loves to talk. He‚Äôll talk about whatever is on his mind and just keep going on and on, and I honestly don‚Äôt mind it. I like hearing him speak about whatever he wants to, of course I come in with my own thoughts at times but most of the time it‚Äôs him talking and me listening. I like our dynamic, and he‚Äôs told me a few times that he doesn‚Äôt mind it either to reassure me.

However, I feel bad that I don‚Äôt contribute as much as I feel like I should. He tells me (I‚Äôm paraphrasing) ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt get stuck on it and don‚Äôt get held up on the awkward silences. You know I still like you because if I didn‚Äôt, I wouldn‚Äôt continue talking and hanging out with you.‚Äù And other helpful things along those lines. 

I appreciate that he tells me this, but I still want to be able to hold a conversation and contribute more despite the fact that he doesn‚Äôt mind it too much. What kind of conversations should I try to start up? How do I get myself to be less anxious? Any advice would be great.",
dating,1477u95,2023-06-11 22:44:42,GF‚Äôs mum offered to buy a house with her for us to live in. Is it a risk or should I be for it?,"I‚Äôm 30M and my GF is 28F. We‚Äôve been dating for 2.5 years now and have been living together in a rented New Build flat for 1.5 years.

We‚Äôve been having a few issues when discussing the topic of buying a property.

My problem: Before I moved out with her, I‚Äôve been living with my mum previously in a council flat. Once you live there for over 15 years, you‚Äôre automatically entitled to buying it with a 127k discount. We‚Äôve been there for 22 years. My mum is unemployed and doesn‚Äôt work anymore due to her health conditions. I‚Äôve always had a plan to buy it at some point. Once I do, I have to own it for at least 5 years before I‚Äôm able to sell it and benefit from the discount. I can only buy it on my own as I‚Äôm working full time, and my mum isn‚Äôt. She‚Äôs happy to take herself off the tenancy so I can buy.

My GF‚Äôs problem: She‚Äôs always wanted to buy a property. The first 8 months of us being together, we nearly ended up buying a house together before I had to put my foot down and say it‚Äôs way too soon (and not even married yet!) and we should rent first - so we did.
The New Build flat we are living in now, their scheme is we have to either move out by the end of 5 years, or buy a share of 25%-75% of the flat.
The problem here is as I want to buy my mums flat, I can‚Äôt already own a home, so therefore I cannot buy both at once. Plus it would be a struggle as I don‚Äôt know if I can afford both at once.

Her problem is:

1) She keeps telling me she does not like to and does not want to continue wasting money on rent when it could be going on a mortgage

2) She‚Äôs going from full time to part time soon with her job, so wanted to try buy somewhere before her payslips shows her part time salary and she won‚Äôt be able to buy anywhere

3) She‚Äôs worried I won‚Äôt be able to pay for both

I told her to wait and stop rushing to buy now. She‚Äôs only 28. But she just has it in her head that she‚Äôs wasting money on rent and wants to buy somewhere.

Then she talks to her mum (as she always does everyday), but they spoke about this problem, and as her mum always likes to help, she offered to buy a house with my GF in both of their names, whilst I buy my mums flat, then after the 5 years when I sell my mums flat, she says she will take her name off the mortgage and put my name on. She also offered to help pay 500 a month for the mortgage too until my name goes on.

At first, before her mum suggested this, I was given advice that I should NOT buy anywhere with her as we are not even married yet and it‚Äôs too soon as we‚Äôve only been together for 2.5 years. And I was also concerned that it could be a trap, as if we were ever to break up and we had a mortgage together, it would be so complicated. Then her mum suggesting this idea, I don‚Äôt know if I feel happy paying for their mortgage whilst I‚Äôm living there? Her mum seems genuine and wants to help out her own daughter and me as I‚Äôm her partner, but as I‚Äôm an outsider, I see it as a big risk as I‚Äôm pretty much paying for their mortgage without my name on there but I‚Äôm living there?

My GF says it‚Äôll be good for the both of us and our future. My GF loves me and wants to be with me, so do I but I don‚Äôt feel comfortable rushing into buying. Whenever I say she should wait, she gets upset as she thinks I‚Äôm screwing her over again as she wants to buy but I keep stopping her.

She‚Äôs willing to wait to buy somewhere with her mum for 2-3 years if I could guarantee her that by then I‚Äôll take that offer.

I don‚Äôt know what to do?","You should ask a lawyer - not here. Unfortunately you cannot trust them even if they are the best women in the world, a lot can change in a few years. Heck even in a few days.

You should do something like a money loan and be crystal clear who owes whom, how much money, and what happens if you break up. Again, a lawyer can help. But you absolutely cannot be so uncovered as you seem"

As someone who holds conversation in high regard, I find myself struggling with many, but not all, women my age.

dating,1477npc,2023-06-11 22:37:00,Let's Talk Herpes,"Can we talk herpes? HSV-2 genital herpes is minimally life impacting from a physical standpoint, but the psychological trauma and stigma remains unbearable. People are ignorant and cruel. Someone I love has had to deal with this trauma, and watching them struggle is a pain that I wish every day I could take away. The only thing I can think to do is to speak up and try to destigmatize what is such an undramatic, minimally impacting, and actually very common condition. It's 2023, people. 

First, know that if you live in the US, you've been programmed by the media and Big Pharma to react how you react to herpes. A 2016 Vice News expos√© found that, starting in the 1970s, there is evidence that ‚Äúbig pharma‚Äù likely conjured up and perpetuated stigma to increase sales of a new drug. To advertise the drug, herpes had to be pushed as a disease worthy of attention, the answer to which was a sex panic. Much of the hysteria affecting the social status of herpes was then generated by the media. A 1982 TIME magazine cover labeled genital herpes ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs Scarlet Letter.‚Äù This is also why, conversely, there's almost no stigma around herpes in European countries. Most of Europe has long banned pharmaceutical advertising so the media manipulation to market drugs was impossible. 

So what can we all do? Shake off media manipulation and Big Pharma programming. Get educated. Educate others. Speak up to stigma. Let people live. 

Facts from Planned Parenthood, CDC, and NBC News. [Google for yourself. This isn't homework and I'm not doing a Works Cited about it.]

* Most genital herpes infections are asymptomatic or the symptoms are so mild or nonspecific that the person suffering from them doesn‚Äôt even make the mental connection. With genital herpes, between 65% and 90% of people who have it don't know they do. 

* After the initial infection, both types of herpes can stay dormant for years, and later outbreaks, if any, tend to be mild. In a few cases, it has been known to stay dormant for decades. One of the biggest myths about herpes is that patients had to have gotten it from their current partner. Stress and lowered immunity can cause the virus to activate suddenly.

* Only 10 to 15 percent of people with herpes exhibit symptoms, which may be a silver lining for the millions who unknowingly carry the virus, but it also helps it spread more easily.

* HSV-1 is more active when it infects the facial region, where it can cause cold sores; but can affect the genital region as well. There's long been a myth that this can only impact the facial region. It's incorrect. 

* CDC states that, among Americans 14 to 49 years old, 1 out of 5 women and 1 out of 9 men have a genital HSV-2 infection. Because that stat doesn‚Äôt count genital HSV-1 infections, the overall number of people with genital herpes is actually higher.

* Herpes medications, such as acyclovir or valacyclovir, which greatly decrease rates of asymptomatic shedding and outbreaks. 

* Unlike other STIs, the CDC doesn't even recommend a regular test for herpes as it is not life threatening [except to infants] and diagnosing genital herpes has not been shown to change sexual behavior. Alongside the risk of false positives, ‚Äúthe risk of shaming and stigmatizing people outweighs the potential benefits.‚Äù

* mRNA technology has opened up the door for vaccines, and Moderna is currently developing one to treat herpes. In the near future, it‚Äôs possible that people will be prevented from ever getting herpes and that those with it won‚Äôt have to suffer through outbreaks anymore. Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center virologist Dr. Keith Jerome began exploring the idea that lifelong infections with herpes viruses might be cured by using the DNA-cutting tools of gene therapy. He is on record stating that we may be as close as 3-5 years away. 

Hopefully this helped someone today, or educated somebody, or inspired somebody to educate somebody else. ü©µüôè",
dating,1477hde,2023-06-11 22:30:02,About to meet up with him while we're on break. How should I act?,"A week ago he proposed a break because he had been feeling really unhappy. He said he would like to get back together within 2 months and that he has no desire to see anybody else during it. He said he just wants some space because we had been arguing so much for several months and it just made him too stressed.  
  
Last year we met up on the last day of school (We go to different schools) Because attendance isn't mandatory so we skipped. We decided to continue the tradition this year as well.  
  
The thing is I don't know how to act when we meet up. I'm worried that if I'm too fun to hang out with he's going to think ""Wow, I have a much happier time hanging out with her when we're just friends. So maybe we should just be friends and not get back together"" But I also dont want to be boring and make him think ""Wow, she's so boring, I guess we really lost the spark and now I don't want to be with her.""  
  
What should I do?? I just want him to think ""Wow I miss dating her"". Should I flirt? I plan on doing non bold flirts. For example I wont say stuff like ""Wow you look so handsome"" but I might say ""Wow you smell nice""  
  
Should I withhold physical touch so that he knows that a friendship with me won't have those sweet moments of putting an arm around each other, that he can only receive that in a romantic relationship with me? It might be kind of awkward though, like am I supposed to just take his arm off of me if he does that? If I'm too cold he'll just think I'm still a source of unhappiness.  
  
Should I bring up positive happy memories in the relationship? What if that looks too obvious and desperate? If so, what kind of memories? I wouldn't bring up extremely romantic ones but maybe just more sweet ones like ""Do you remember how we went to the arcade nearby and listened to Halloween music?""

  
Also I do plan on dressing nicely but I genuinely don't think looks are going to make a difference. He's not superficial, he's not going to randomly want me back immediately because I dressed up. 

  
WHAT SHOULD I DO?",

His only personality flaw is that he's too shy and quiet.

Now physically he's 100% a nerd. Glasses, tall, skinny, kind of a crappy haircut but oh well... But underneath his style he has a very pretty face and nice proportions. Not my type but could be.

The problem is that he's also younger than me... He's 21 I'm 26 and we don't really have much in common or have the same quick thinking/sense of humor so I'm lost as to what to do. He seems to like me, no one has said anything but you can just tell from the way he behaves.

I'd honestly like to have sex with him. Nerds are so kinky- but I don't want to waste such a good person for such a frivolous activity. I think he's 100% dating material, but just not for me for the previous reasons.",Quote of the day: ‚ÄúNerds are so kinky‚Äù
dating,1476vf4,2023-06-11 22:04:58,My boyfriend 30m told me 26f that his feelings aren't growing,"I met a guy online and we moved into a relationship pretty fast. talked for about a week and made things official by the third date. We talk on the phone every night and see each other once every week due to his job. We've been together for a month and last night he told me that he likes me but his feelings haven't grown and he's worried that it never will. On one of our previous talks he mentioned that he never really loved any of his ex girlfriends either. He's had three serious relationships before me and they lasted 1-3 years. Him telling me that his feelings aren't growing hurt so much. Having only been together for a month, I also haven't developed huge feelings for him which I think is because I'm scared to let someone have my heart, but I never was worried about it because it's only been a month. We have so much time to get to know each other, we haven't even scratched the surface but him being worried about his feelings for me, makes me feel like I need to be worried. When I told him that I think we should break up because I can't wait for the possible chance that he someday will develop love for me, he asked me if that's what I wanted which I responded with no and he told me that he didn't want to either and that he wants to have more time with me. He also mentioned that I'm so different compared to his ex girlfriends and that's another reason why he wants to work it out. He said that I make him feel at peace, I guess he experiences a lot of mental highs and lows and he said that I keep him grounded. We also never fight, we just have a lot of serious talks which is very different from his past relationships where his ex's would just constantly yell at him. But on the flip side, we as people are very different, from interests like music to culture and language. I don't know what to do, whether I should wait it out or not. It hasn't been long, but I don't know if waiting is even worth it.","Hard to say, a month is still quite fresh. Though, it seems a bit strange that he would tell you his feelings aren't growing. I don't know if I would have much tolerance for that so early in a relationship."
dating,1476thu,2023-06-11 22:02:50,High School Crush,"Now that I'm in high school, I've made new friends ans met some new types of people. There is this one girl who didn't catch my attention at first but then I started learning more about her. I found out about common interests such as art and anime and I guess we were pretty good friends.  


Long story short, she's been paired with me on several assignments which seemed as if it was planned although I doubted it. As we spent more time together I started to like her. A couple of days ago our class volunteered as supervisors in an exam. And guess what? She was paired to work with me! I could hear my heartbeat through the silence and I think she did too since she left to the other part of the class. From there I noticed she would keep staring at me and I got even more flustered. However, it was the happiest hour of my life.

Now she's on my mind everyday and I just want to meet her asap. I really want to get close to her and make a move or something but I don't want it to be false hope and just make a fool of myself. What should I do?",

What did you learn about yourself, love, and relationships?","I lost a girl I thought I'd be with forever when I was 23.. and it took me a good 2 years before I realised that it wasn't meant to be. I'm now 34 and have been married to an amazing woman for 2 years.. we also have a daughter together. And I can honestly promise you, I wouldn't swap my wife for my ex in a million years...

Now, what created this change for me? It was:

\- Focusing on compatibility as opposed to 'excitement'... I thought my early twenties relationship was exciting, but actually it was just emotional inconsistency that I mistook for excitement

\- Improving myself... (losing weight, hitting the gym, eating well, sleeping well, drinking less alcohol)

\- Realising that I was often looking at the past through rose tinted glasses.. after I lost that girl in my early twenties, I convinced myself our relationship was perfect.. but the more I thought about it, and the more time that went on, the more I realised how many negative details I'd chosen to look past / forget)

dating,1476ipl,2023-06-11 21:51:08,I met this girl online but I have no idea if she likes me,"So as the title says I met a girl on an app called boo after a month we basically went out and I can say I was not really interested when I talked to her through chat but when I met her I really liked being with her.

Her personality is tomboyish and she has a mouth like a sailor but I enjoy being with her a lot allthough we have actually gone out 4 times by now.

I have no idea if she has any romantic feelings with me but She asked to meet my friends and we went to cinema together. She told me from the guys she has met I am one of the 2 guys that respect her and haven't tried anything like touching her inappropriately(she said someone grabbed her thighs when she went to watcha movie with him).

She also basically went to the beach with me and I kinda met her step father and her mother and her sister and brother but long story short her father is trying to take the kids away but his is a drug addict and at one point she said ""Never become a man like that"" and I kinda took it as a sign but I have no idea.

She said to me to tell her every time I want to go watch a movie because she is interested in going with me. Also she told me once that I am a friend and I took that as she wasn't interested in dating.

There was a red flag when she didn't have money and I offered to pay for food for her and her brother and sister but she said she would give me the money back and she actually did so I am fine with that.

No, idea how I should approach this but I can definitely say I like her and at the very least if she doesn't like me I can make a friend I enjoy being with.","Welcome to /r/dating. Please make sure you read our [rules here](https://new.reddit.com/r/dating/about/rules) and remember to:

dating,1476geq,2023-06-11 21:48:46,my (f22) bf (m24) had a fight that escalated real quick,"we were out having lunch and then I brought up a story about a relative who used to stay in my house and who flirted with me about 3-4 years ago. my boyfriend got so frustrated and told me to block him immediately, but then proceeded to say things about my father like ‚Äúyour father isn‚Äôt a real man because he should be aware of things going on inside of his house‚Äù but I told him my dad has nothing to do with it because I was the one who never told him it happened in the first place. and then I started crying like a baby in the restaurant because I just couldn‚Äôt stand anyone saying such things about my father. 

on our way back home in the car we started fighting and then he changed his words and said that he never said that my father wasnt a man but instead said that IF my father wasn‚Äôt aware of things in his house then yea he isn‚Äôt a man. then while we were fighting, he said that relationships are very stressful and asked me to drop him to his car which I did and then when we reached, he just left without saying anything. 


couple hours later, he texted me apologizing and said
‚Äú i dont think i should‚Äôve brought up ur dad like that‚Äù

I said I appreciate you apologizing and I agree he hasn‚Äôt texted me since I think he‚Äôs just waiting for me to text him but I don‚Äôt think I will do it 

Who is been doing great before this fight? It‚Äôs been such a lovely time recently and I have been so in love but the fight came out of nowhere and I just hate how he would say mean things when he‚Äôs frustrated. 

he‚Äôs most definitely expecting me to text him right now but I don‚Äôt think I would. Should I be the bigger person and text him considering that he has apologized or should I wait for him to text me again?","People are human

We‚Äôve been dating for quite some time. He practically live together and while he was in the shower I was cleaning the top of his dresser but he left a drawer half open and I see something gold. I ended up pulling it out to find out it was a black and gold lingerie. 

He got out of the shower to say; you‚Äôre the main one though. I want you and only you. You‚Äôre still breathing etc. I quite honestly don‚Äôt know how I feel. I don‚Äôt want to cut him off. I chatted with him today. lol goes to show how I cannot leave but don‚Äôt want to forgive him right away. I feel I should distance my self to process my own feelings. 

Any one have advice on taking back a cheater or how to go about a situation like so.","Break up with him. You don't want to waste your time on somebody who doesn't care at all about your feelings and is willing to hurt you.

If you stay with him, you'll just be wasting the best years of your life."
dating,14763e1,2023-06-11 21:34:35,"21M Im done, I want something real - not this fake love.","Howdy folks, I‚Äôm 21M and Im more ‚Äúfortunate‚Äù than most men when it comes to receiving attention from women. I‚Äôve never had trouble finding casual relationships or flings. And in the past I would bounce around from girl to girl until I found someone who I genuinely held romantic interest in.

I just can‚Äôt do this anymore. I don‚Äôt like hookups, ONS, and flings/casual relationships always fall apart because either me or the other person catches feelings and slowly to quickly the relationship falls apart.

I want a real relationship, I want real love and affection. But the only people I seem to attract are promiscuous women - even the ones I try and settle down with whom I think are loyal and good LTR partners I‚Äôve found out have either lied or cheated on me.

This has lead me to not trusting any woman. A man can only have his heart broken and trust shattered so many times before he swears off it entirely.

Mind you I‚Äôm very introspective and I‚Äôve changed a lot over the years to try and attract the kind of person I want. But the double standards in dating nowadays is simply ridiculous. And why even bother trying to find someone when I know that in my experience every time I do they end up cheating on me.

I know I shouldn‚Äôt complain, and I‚Äôm at a point of privilege with the attention I receive from women. But it just hurts to be seen as just another ‚Äúoption‚Äù or sexual object for these people.

I just wanted to find someone I cared for, someone who could care for me the same way. And it hurts knowing I‚Äôll probably never get that.

Oh well, if there‚Äôs any advice I‚Äôd appreciate it. But I doubt there‚Äôs any, for now I‚Äôm just gonna avoid dating entirely.",
dating,1475uv2,2023-06-11 21:25:11,Am I [F23] too young to settle? Should I give up partying?,"Sorry if this is a strange question. But please, hear me out.

Many of relationships/situationships that I've had for the past few years always have the same thing in common - I seem to be more into the guy than he is into me.

There have been times that I've literally cried myself to sleep after hooking up with certain men. And I still don't even know why I cried. Maybe I just wanted more from them? Maybe I just didn't want to feel used? I really don't even know. 

Most of my friends my age say that it's way too young to settle with one man. But I often wonder if I should be spending my time building up a life with one man, or maybe if I should just continue being a ""party girl"" (for lack of a better word). Either way, there is a trade-off.

And I hate to say this, but the ""nice guys"" that I've encountered often times don't seem all that physically appealing to me. But the guys that I really want tend to have lots of options and see me as more of a ""side chick"". So I'm stuck not knowing what to do with myself. Does anyone have any insight?","If you‚Äôre crying yourself to sleep after sleeping with certain guys, it‚Äôs probably best not to keep pursuing those kinds of situations.  

At the same time there‚Äôs a wide gulf between just meaningless hookups and jumping right into a long-term committed relationship, and you don‚Äôt have to choose between either extreme right off the bat.  

Some level of physical attraction is important for any relationship, but it‚Äôs one element amongst many if you‚Äôre looking to actually date someone for a while and enjoy their company outside of the bedroom.  

I wouldn‚Äôt suggest starting with a guy you‚Äôre not attracted to, but if there‚Äôs a guy who‚Äôs maybe a 7/10 for you but who you have a good vibe with in terms of personality and interests and is looking to get to know you more as a person instead of just a sexual object vs a 9/10 guy who just wants in your pants and will go on to the next conquest afterwards, maybe give the first guy a shot."

dating,1475a6l,2023-06-11 21:02:53,Need advice on navigating financial dynamics in a new relationship,"Hey Reddit! I (26F) recently started dating this amazing guy (27M) that I met on Hinge. We hit it off right away, had lengthy phone calls, and texted non-stop. However, there's something that has been bothering me, and I could really use your advice on how to handle it.  
A little background: I work part-time as a substitute teacher to pay my bills while pursuing a full-time Master's degree. On the other hand, he earns a significantly higher income than I do. We live about 2 hours apart, so it took a while for us to finally meet in person due to his vacation plans. We finally met on Thursday, I took the train to his town.  
Now that we have met, we've been going out to eat quite frequently. On the first day, he paid for our takeout dinner, and the next day I covered the bill for lunch. Then, there was a short night out with his friends where he covered the expenses. However, today, while we were out in town, he claimed to have forgotten his wallet, so I ended up paying for the bill.  
This situation has left me unsure of how to handle things. I can't keep up with his financial ability to eat out so often, and I'm not even sure how to bring up this topic for discussion. We've agreed to date exclusively during the four days we spent together, but I'm uncertain about the financial aspect of our relationship.  
I don't want to come across as demanding or unappreciative, but I also want to be fair to myself and my financial situation. How should I approach this conversation? What would be the appropriate way to address my concerns about our differing financial circumstances? I really care about him, and I want to make sure we start this relationship on the right foot.  
Looking forward to hearing your thoughts and advice!",">How should I approach this conversation? What would be the appropriate way to address my concerns about our differing financial circumstances?

""I really enjoy spending time with you. But can we eat out less and do cheaper things more? I'm a teacher and can't afford to keep going out for dinner like this.""

And if you want to be flirty, you can even coyly add ""I'll make it up to you\~"" or something. 

The important part is to convey that this isn't a rejection and you do truly enjoy this relationship, but that the financial aspects don't work for you."

dating,1474zzi,2023-06-11 20:52:04,Feelings for a friend's ex update,"For context see the previous post on my profile.

I have an amazing friend who I pretty deeply connected with after an evening where we found out someone we know had died. It was pretty shocking as we're fairly young and was one of the first people we both knew to die. That evening caused us to talk through lots about experiences in our past that I definitely hadn't spoken to anyone about. We both comforted eachother and it felt really good to get things off our chests.

We met up fairly regularly since that and our friendship grew and I began to catch feelings and I'm almost certain she did too but it was so close to her leaving I didn't think it was right to talk about as I didn't want to put any pressure on her for her time away, I wanted her to do whatever she wanted and enjoy herself without thinking of me too much. We have stayed in contact and have been calling eachother pretty much weekly.

The story gets a bit trickier because she used to be in a long term relationship with one of my mates. He's not a really close friend but we are in the same friendship group and share really close friends. I haven't spoken to him at all about the situation as I dont know what was going to come of it when she returns and I feel like I didn't really get to see her enough to know for sure that it's worth pursuing because of the potential damage it could cause to the friendship with my mate and our friendship group. That's what I'm most worried about but I know she's an amazing person and we seem to get on like a house on fire. 

Now that she's getting close to coming home the reality of telling him and other people are causing me a fair bit of worry and I'm scared on how it will all pan out.

If anyone has and advice or stories of how similar situations ended up I'd be very grateful. Thanks :)

Some points to add:

I didn't intend to catch feelings because of their relationship but I suppose they can't be helped.

It began >4months after they'd broken up and when she's home it will be 9 I think.

I feel really guilty about not telling him but I'm not sure I should have up to this point.

If it does continue with her how should I approach the conversation with him? My current plan is with honesty and respect and to listen to him about his feelings but outline my intentions so he doesn't feel lied to.",
dating,1474zda,2023-06-11 20:51:25,Extremely mixed signals from a hinge match,"I posted about this person before, and I feel like I already know the answer, but again, I need some advice and I don't have many people to talk to.

TLDR is I met this really cute and badass girl on hinge for a date last week Friday. During the date she said she blocks guys she doesn't like after the date. She messaged me like 10 min after dropoff and said I had fun thanks again for dinner. So I take that as a great sign.

On Monday, I asked if she wanted to minigolf sometime next week, she said yeah for sure, maybe wednesday? On wednesday, I asked her if she still wanted to go and she said she was too tired. I decided I'll wait for her to message me. (This made sense because plans werent concrete and she works at 6am).

Friday, out of the blue, she asks ''wyd tonight'', I said Ill be free after 8 and ill lyk if it's not too late still like an hour later. She said actually im tired now, how about tomorrow? I said sure! What time, she said ill lyk because ill be tanning and swimming with my friend. She's snapping me doing what she said the next day, But she never let me know, so I hit her up like 7:30 and she said she would but shes going out to dinner. I just said ''Alright'' and cut my losses. Like 3 hours later, 10:30, she texts me ''Im Drunk lol''. I just said ''Nice, have fun lol'' and she said ''thank u'' and I left her on read. 

My take is I stop texting/snapping her completely? Wait to see if she messages me 1 last time, and actually sets a concrete date?

We ended up only ever having our 1st date and couldnt ever make a 2nd, but only because of her. Why would she ask wyd tonight then an hour later be too tired? Why would she skip hanging with me for dinner with her friend then drunk text me a few hours later?

I get that we litreally dont know eachother and have any type of real connection yet, but she's sending me extremely mixed signals every other day.","Sorry to say but to me it sounds like she may just be bored and is using you as a back up. I could be wrong, but generally when someone is interested in you they make a point to communicate & try and set aside time for you. It's entirely possible she's more a spur of the moment type person, and if that's so you just have to ask yourself if that's something you're okay with.

The drunk text's though? That's always been a red flag to me. Especially if the person hasn't really been communicating much. Whenever a guy does this to me generally they're just looking for a hookup."

Then by the time my friends left it was almost 11PM and i still had to go to the gym to follow my program so i didn't leave til it was pretty much 2am but i was still texting her between sets. When i finally got home she asked to talk on the phone, i really enjoy talking to her but it was way too late and i know if we got on the phone we're gonna be up til morning so i told her that it was late for me and we can talk tomorrow if she has time and she just left me on read which was weird. But anyway i texted her the following day to see if what her work schedule is like, no answer all day. Then she finally said that i could have given her 10 mins cuz she been waiting to talk all day and that i didn't like her enough to give her such a small amount of time out of my day.

When there is a keyboard hiding you, you can be whomever you want to be. Even a zoom call hides who a person is. In a in person meeting you can see their eyes (pupils) and body language and get a solid vibe from them. When law enforcement conducts an interview, it is in person, not over the phone, not through messages typed.

dating,1473ddm,2023-06-11 19:49:01,My girlfriend occasionally brings up her ex,"Okay so me and her have been seeing each other for a little over a month now and its going pretty good. I have met her parents, we have gone a few dates, we enjoy being together and have a good time. When I am at work we will text (occasionally) at work and then talk more when I am out and when I am not at work we hang out in person about twice a week. She has been very open with her feelings and has told me a lot whats going on in her mind. Overall its been pretty good but there is something that is bothering me.

So her and I got together about 3/4 months after she got out of a year-ish relationship which I understand she is still healing but the problem is she will keep bringing up her ex and stuff they did. It isn't constant but for example- we will be talking about cooking and then she will say ""do you wanna hear the funniest cooking story?"" and then proceeds to tell me about a story with her and her ex. Or we will be on a walk and she will tell me how her and her ex went there to see a sunset. Or she will tell me a story how she was in his room and his mouse burned on the desk.

Usually she tries to talk about it in a funny way and I think she may just being thinking about those memories because its on topic to what we're talking about but I can't help but feel jealous? I feel like I am being compared to him and that I will never be able to give her what she wants. 

According to her, he is very buff and she has told me she really likes muscles. Like when I asked if there was anything that she missed from that relationship she told me ""I miss the muscles but nothing else. I  hate him and he hates me."" While I want to believe she hates him I still feel like I am not enough. She has told me she really, really likes me and she ""adores"" me but when she brings him up it does hurt.

I apologize if I wrote this poorly, I am feeling kind of sad right now.","I think it‚Äôs totally normal to feel how you are feeling and important to remember that those insecurities are yours. It‚Äôs better that she feels comfortable enough to talk about her ex than it would be if she felt she had to filter her speech around you. You never wanna feel like you‚Äôre walking on thin ice or have to filter yourself around someone you‚Äôre trying to build a relationship with. There may be ways you can tame your own insecurity without making her feel like she can‚Äôt speak her mind, like for example ask her if she thinks you should get more muscular without mentioning anything about the ex or her previous comments so that way you know how to feel about that anxiety in your mind about being good enough or not. What‚Äôs also bothering you is the uncertainty that you feel when she talks about someone else who once made her heart skip beats and gave her butterflies, and for that I don‚Äôt know what to say but I guess it‚Äôs just part of falling for someone that the thought of another person being their significant other is anxiety-inducing.

I have never talked to her before, and I have no idea if she likes me back, but there are some signals (like quite a lot of eye contact etc) so that's why I want to try to shoot my shot anyways.

You have a much higher success rate if you go in with unshakable confidence and smiling, people tend to mirror, if you bring a little playful energy she‚Äôll be a lot more interested then if you went over there like you‚Äôre reading a statement.

dating,14735pn,2023-06-11 19:40:37,How do you let the one you love most go,"It's been a little less than 2 months now since my ex and I have broken up. Our parting was mutual.

As far as breakups go, it was... mature, I think. It wasn't because we grew to dislike each other, nor was it a compatibility issue, nor was it because there was a violation of trust in any form.

I think it happened because we loved each other too much. I loved her more than my own life, and that was the problem.

My ex and I were together for close to 5 years, having met at the start of college. It was my first long term relationship, and essentially my first real relationship in general. I mean what I say, and this is no exaggeration - I loved every single thing about her. I still do.

But I made my love for her too important, and I think she did the same. We became emotionally codependent, and we recognized it all too late. Even on a subconscious level, I think it had begun to wear us down having to depend on the other for emotional stability all the time. We weren't living as people because all we had was each other. And we both bottled things up, because we cared too deeply for each other.

It had to hit a breaking point at some point, and it did. And when it happened, we recognized that we needed time apart to learn to become our own people, discover who we were outside of a relationship, et cetera. Because the fact was that neither of us were happy being by ourselves. Of course then, we couldn't have been truly happy together.

It's been almost 2 months now. The first month was spent dissociating from the shock of it all. I'm still packing my things. But I've had some time and space to reflect on it all. It feels like I've learned the lesson already, like I can point out and name all the things that led to our breakup and how to prevent those same issues again. Everyone always says it needs time, that her and I need time. And I agree. But I want to try again. And she wants and needs time and space. And I have to respect that.

She is someone I trust to be my partner in the truest sense of the word. Someone I want to bring the best out of, and someone I trust to bring the best out of me. And yet we broke up because we didn't know how to be whole, complete, happy people without each other. But I do know now. I have to let her go completely. And yet, I still want to grow old with her.

This had to happen for both of our sakes. I know that. I do. But I want her in my life. But I can't want that. I want to know that we'll find each other again. But again, I cant.

Sorry for the long read, I just don't know what to do.",

Think skin tone of Devi from never have I ever. I never get hit on or asked out. (To be fair, I am very slow and can't tell when someone flirts with me, and also have an ""eccentric"" personality.) I was wondering whether it had to do with my race? Im an indian woman, and Toronto is considered super progressive. I also have a nose that is a bit broader, think a typical east asian nose. I read a lot of studies on how darker skinned black women were considered less attractive, and how beauty standards are eurocentric. Not sure how much that's relevant now though. Plus smaller interview studies (with like 3-18) people on how south asian women were affected by beauty standards, and some women mentioned how insecure they felt growing up, though to be fair, so did east asian women. I just genuinely do not know how I am percieved and that kind of bothers me","I don't think your race would be an issue for most guys (e.g., there are tons of Canadian guys who watch Never Have I Ever too and find her attractive).

dating,1472qbr,2023-06-11 19:23:41,Any actually *good* dating websites or apps for Germany that don't steal your data?,"So I have actually have had a pretty good times a few years ago when using dating apps in Berlin, but have moved to another city and am now thinking about using a dating app or website service again, because my working situation has stabilized enough to look for something else.

However, I tried to install Okcupid (again) and am really dissatisfied with the ""new"" app layout. I found some really nice girls through the ""common interest"" match category a few years ago and still think it was awesome, because the app could match me up with girls with the same weird niche interests. They removed that function - unfortunately.

...and I feel increasingly uncomfortable with using these dating apps. 

As you probably know, those apps don't cost \*money\*, they make money by selling your data. Okcupid for example asks for your precise location, your private phone number, your political views, whether you smoke or not, your drug usage (...), whether you litter or not, what your ""secret"" sexual desires are etc.

I think it's REALLY creepy that this app asks me all this stuff and I don't want to give that information away. I deinstalled the OkCupid app after just one day or so, because it has become absolutely awful in my opinion.

Is there any reasonably priced alternative or (non-profit?) open software project which doesn't has this downside?

...I feel like it's kind of strange how ""love"" is being used as a profit oriented business sector anyway... Some things shouldn't be controlled by monetary interests or monetized and I feel like this is the case for the dating web service market.

Is there just some service I haven't heard about yet?",

dating,14729x3,2023-06-11 19:06:04,Single mom (26F) asked to reschedule our date on the day of. Is this just a soft way of letting me (27M) down?,"I've (27M) been chatting with a single mom (26F) on Hinge for about a week, and we had plans for brunch today. However, she asked to reschedule after I expressed my excitement about seeing her today due to her having the kid that afternoon. What's concerning is that she ignored my message asking about her day the previous Friday, and she didn't text on Saturday, even though we had been talking every day since we matched. It's worth noting that she felt comfortable enough to give me her actual phone number, which seemed like a positive sign. Throughout our conversations, I've been mindful not to be overbearing or send multiple messages, and the flow of conversation has been natural. On Thursday, we exchanged goodnight messages with heart emojis, which I took as a positive sign based on my own experience.

Although I wasn't particularly eager to reach out the following day, I still felt it important to live up to my word and maintain consistency, even if it meant sending a message I didn't necessarily want to send.

Determining her level of interest based on these interactions is challenging. There's a possibility that something genuinely came up, preventing her from responding promptly. However, it's also possible that her lack of response or rescheduling could indicate a lack of interest. I've given her the opportunity to suggest a time when she's free, but I'm uncertain if she will actually reach out.

Was this just a nice way for her to let me down?",

Started off with a really nice naivety and hopefulness which has been crushed a lot by not having boundaries and a super low self esteem. I‚Äôve had one partner who ended up a criminal (theft) and fled the country, that left a lot of scars as they were 32 and my old manager. They would love to tell me that I didn‚Äôt understand the world etc. My last ex I have had the most toxic and complicated relationship over the last couple years, we even ended up living together and working together but it turned super awful when I had to take on their responsibilities and clean the accomodation and themselves. There was a lot of sleep deprivation I had to go through and I felt scared all the time to do something wrong. 

Anywaysss.. all of that said. Very stupidly I know, I went to go hu with my ex and I experience the very familiar feeling that I dreaded to feel again. The feeling of all the serotonin leaving your body once you‚Äôve left a date or they‚Äôve left you. I‚Äôve read it‚Äôs like the high of a drug, all the excitement and adrenaline and worry and then it‚Äôs all over. Every date I have ever had I have experienced this feeling.

dating,1471gsn,2023-06-11 18:35:06,Advice for Dealing with Anxious Attachment Style When Dating,"I suffer from Anxious Attachment Style.  It very nearly can destroy your relationship if your not careful.

Some things that I have to remember

Your anxious feelings will be at their highest in the first 2 months after meeting someone.  So you need to be extra careful in this time period.  Your going to obsess about whether or not they really like you, will you stop hearing from them one day, etc.  The first 2 months is the danger zone.  Be careful.  After 2 months you'll likely have an idea if things are going well with the person, and you will feel a little more secure, but you got to get through the first 2 months first without sabotaging the relationship.

Don't love bomb.  I'm guilty of this.  In your mind you think you're trying to show them how much you like them.  But in reality you are dumping all your insecurities on them.  Your love bombing them with an over the top amount of affection because that's what you want from them in order to get rid of your anxious insecurities.  Recognize your tendency to do this, and don't do it.  They will feel uncomfortable when you do this.  Instead, be more subtle in your displays of affection to them, especially early on.

Texting as an anxious type...it's going to drive you crazy when they take a long time to message you back, or don't message you as much as you hope they would.  Resist the urge to text bomb them.  If they take 6 hours to respond, just wait.  Wait.  It will be agonizing.  It will hurt.  You will feel like a drug addict that's been ripped away from his steady drip.  But remember this.  If you text them back with a 'where are you' or 'what's going on' or God forbid an angry or hateful type text, you will only make things worse.  You must realize that.  Being anxious only hurts your prospect with this person.  It does not help at all.

If they haven't texted you back for a long time, then they just don't feel like talking to you.  Accept it.  You must be vulnerable.  You must accept that the person you like does not want to talk to you right now.  You have to come to terms with them not being available or wanting to communicate with you 24/7.   But this DOES NOT mean they do not like you, or want to break up with you, or anything like that.  They just don't want to talk to you right now.  That's it.

Now, if they are always taking forever to get back to you, then yes, they probably do not like you.  But if they take a long time to respond to only 1/4 or 1/5 messages you send them and even take the time to explain why they took so long to get back to you, then they're probably someone who likes ou.

Avoid stalking their social media.  Do this, and your just adding fuel to the fire of your anxious attachment style.

Finally, remember that your far more likely to repel someone by being too attached and clingy, then if you were too distant and unavailable.  Anxious attachment minds think the key to winning someone over is going all in - but we think this because it's how we would like to be treated - and we like to be treated like this because we are unwell.  Remember that.  If you think you aren't doing enough, remember that it is better to be on the side of caution and do too little.","22M here , dating my 21F gf since October , became official in February. I‚Äôm glad I figured most of what you said out on my own . While I never told my girlfriend I have an anxious attachment style , I‚Äôve known about it for over a year now. Truth be told I always wanted a pure 1 on 1 relationship with someone I could regard as a romantic best friend . My brothers frequently clown on me for being a lover boy. Oddly , in those times where I was left hanging for more hours than I expected and started to go into a slight panic, I turned it all off like a switch by being stoic , not really being too talkative , or adding a period with zero emojis when I texted. Admittedly I was being passive aggressive. She remarked how I was texting like her professors , straight to the point no beating around the bush and joking about it. I didn‚Äôt find shit funny and was actually upset with her for cancelling on plans or barely seeing each other every 2 or 3 weeks at a time. I knew she liked me a lot , it‚Äôs just that on the weekends (the only time we both have ‚Äútime‚Äù to see each other) ,some shit always popped up, she had overbearing parents , and being too busy with school work (she‚Äôs in college , I‚Äôm not , I did college for a semester when I was 18 and went straight to work afterwards). I felt like she wasn‚Äôt putting enough effort into seeing me , I didn‚Äôt ever think as many hours as I work , that it‚Äôd be ME waiting for a text back. I wasn‚Äôt pushy either , I would‚Äôve settled for a 2hr lunch once every weekend . It got to a point where I asked her if she thinks she has enough time for me in general , because I was pissed about it . We talked about it , she told me about esteem issues she had , seeing a therapist , a recent death in the family , we got over and I‚Äôve gotten over my attachment issue with her.

LOL I am so fucking lonely
Recently my activities have consisted of hyper fixation on old Hollywood actresses and their tragic lives because secretly part of me wants to see myself in them. Every guy I‚Äôve ever had feelings for has chosen some other girl over me.
I can‚Äôt even be mad at the other girl because she‚Äôs just what he wants. But here‚Äôs the thing that fucking kills me inside:
If she‚Äôs the one that he wants, why does he even fucking bother me in the first place?? I make it very clear I am a good person, loving, loyal, and have my own unique personality and interests. I have integrity, yet guys always choose the next fucking girl that looks at them. 
What did I ever do to deserve this endless fucking cycle of being chosen and then left for someone else. It was shitty the first time but over and over again starts to feel like hell. Like I am living in my own personal hell. 
I‚Äôve taken up so many fucking hobbies I could write a book about the things I‚Äôve taught myself to do. I‚Äôve cultivated self love through hardships, taught myself how to sew, embroider, paint, knit, how to use herbs. I am beginning to fucking hate myself, 

I am never the first choice. 

Even by those who are my first choice.

I don‚Äôt have ridiculous standards either

The guys I‚Äôve been with aren‚Äôt the best looking guys by society‚Äôs definition but *I*think they‚Äôre handsome. I never did care about what society thought about who I‚Äôm attracted to, though I know most people *do* care

dating,14708qy,2023-06-11 17:47:07,My date found me crying at the end of our 4th date. Are my dating chances with them over?,"TLDR: got overstimulated, cried, date found me crying, now worried i ruined their perception of me.  


I have been dating this one person for about a month now. they're the second person i ever dated. I'm 20 and I have never dated anyone until i turned 20, so this has been really exciting for me!  
Things have been going really well. We have quite a bit in common, we're both ND (have adhd specifically), we goof around a lot, and we're both very physically affectionate with each other and cant go most dates without touching each other, usually just squishing each others faces, holding hands, playing with each others hair, head pats, snuggling, non-lip kisses, and the like.   
This was how we always were since our first date, which greatly shocked me at first since i have NEVER done like most of these things with anyone before and i hardwired myself as a kid to not touch anyone or get near their spaces, but at the same time, my heart felt overjoyed that someone actually liked me enough to want to touch me on purpose.  
For our 4th/most recent date, we went to a queer dance together. things were going pretty well. however, gradually over time, the dance became overwhelming, and the lights and sounds became overstimulating, even with the noise cancelling headphones i instinctively bought, and me feeling bad because i didnt really know how to dance too well and just really embarrassed myself whenever we'd go on the dance floor, which started to trigger my social anxiety. after like 4 hours of that, it kinda got to me, and once the dance was over, i ended up finding somewhere outside for me to have a moment, which turned into a cry, at.   


my date ended up finding me crying, and ended up comforting me. they even gave me a ride back home and hugged me good night. i appreciate them for that, but im worried that them finding me vulnerable like this this early may have changed their perception of me for the worst, even though they insisted otherwise. i'm slowly starting to realize that i might actually like this person, and i really don't want them seeing me cry ruin any future chances of us having a meaningful relationship. i dont know reddit, what do you have to say?",Did you explain to them the reason you were crying?

Now it's been a month and she is giving me mixed reactions

Like irl we talk really less and I need to start and push the convo

But we text really often and we talk for 3-4 hrs online. And it's also not dry . She is pretty active and does ask me alot of shit and seems interested. ( Every time we have texted I was the first to send the first text)

Idk what to make of it. Is she even interested? Or am I friendzoned? 

Thanks for your advice",[deleted]

Now I have my hobbies and I have a pretty happy life, obviusly some things to improve (my outfit sucks) but in general good. The hobbies I have either I do alone or with friends, the problem is that are a male dominant sports, so not chances to meet girls.

Once a year I travel, 3 -4 weeks, alone as a backpacker and  dont have any problem to hang out with girls, just my English.

Apps not working for me.

How to get over it,"I've been feeling really really disheartened by the turn of events in the last couple of days but am not sure if I am overthinking massively and would really appreciate some advice. I've been seeing this guy - we had been on 3 amazing dates. Never felt so connected deeply with someone before, in every way and also physically very attracted. We have spoken about family, childhood, the future - but in a very natural non-overbearing way. The communication was amazing and he was making the effort to make it obvious he wants to see me also.We haven't been intimate (only kissed . It was going so well, we both felt really comfortable with each other instantly and really got along. I have been on a fair few dates/am usually quite closed off person but with him it was very different. but had to leave town for 3 weeks and he continued to message me, ask questions and carry on conversation whilst I was away and we had planned a date to see each other when I returned to town. But a few days before the date he let me know that he was going out the night before our date for a work event and was going to be really tired for our date. I said no worries, if he's not up for the date we can cancel, but he said no let's still do something. He then lets me know on the day of the date that he has to go out in the evening so we only had 2-3 hours to see each other ?? I still went because I wanted to just see what it would be like , he brought drinks and a blanket as we were going to a nice park in the heatwave. But he was so distant, not really asking that many questions (when he used to ask loads ) I felt like he wasn't present at all and didn't even try to kiss me. Not a lot of eye contact at all also. He hasn't even texted me after the date now . I noticed the energy shifted after I said I'm going away for a lot of the month in the next coming weeks but I was willing to make effort for the days in between. I'm not sure what to make of thir Any thoughts? How do I get over something stopping abruptly? when I was really interested in him and seemed very much reciprocated.","No point guessing tbh, We‚Äôve all been there and it will probably remain a mystery with only one person having the facts. I can think of 3-5 things and it could be something else, big picture is he‚Äôs apparently gone cold and you‚Äôll never know why unless you ask him. 3 dates is still very much the getting to know you phase and you don‚Äôt really know someone at thins early stage and both parties are still consciously and subconsciously collecting information whilst possibly exploring other options. 

How to get over it? Tell yourself it‚Äôs just 3 dates and at this stage it‚Äôs still very much potential and nothing of real significance happened"

Over the last two years, I have had four failed attempts at a relationship. I was the first one to make the move for the first three and really put myself out there when I was getting signals of mutual interest. They all responded that they really liked me, but weren‚Äôt ready for a relationship and didn‚Äôt want to do long distance. Surprise, they all turned around and committed to serious relationships that are long distance. 

In January I decided to take a break and do the emotional work to be happy single and accept being on my own, and that decision alone helped me a lot mentally. But a month into my sworn singleness, a previous acquaintance sent me a Happy Birthday message. ( In college we had mutual friends who thought we‚Äôd hit it off, but covid and life sent us in different directions.) I was skeptical and jaded, but I decided to let things happen and just see where the conversation lead. I didn‚Äôt even tell any of my close friends about him because I was tired of being ¬´¬†that¬†¬ª friend that is always a mess in the relationship dept. 

He took me by surprise. For the first time in so very long, he made me feel secure. I don‚Äôt really trust peoples‚Äô words anymore, but he started to win me over with his actions. He sent flowers, each with a small note. My sister found a candle she thought I‚Äôd like and he bought it, wrapped it up, and sent it to me with a hand written note. We started talking on the phone and the calls would easily last over an hour. That never happens for me because I never feel comfortable enough to be myself. Eventually we made plans to see each other memorial day weekend, and he was able to get off work early and change his flight to fly in earlier than we planned. 

The weekend was‚Ä¶incredible. He was affectionate with me in all the ways I‚Äôve ever wanted from a partner. Without having to ask. I never questioned or was suspicious of his feelings for me. And I admitted to myself that I was falling hard for someone that I hadn‚Äôt been expecting to even meet. Because for the first time in so many years, i loved the person I was with him as much as I liked him. It was so easy to be 100% authentic. 

But then things blew up. On the way to the airport he admitted that he has some stuff he‚Äôs dealing with, to include a recent divorce, that made him question his ability to do a LDR. Something he‚Äôd assured me he was dealing with in therapy when I had addressed it at the beginning of us talking.  It shattered me. Why make all of the effort to fly to see someone, even get an earlier flight, if he didn‚Äôt want to do long distance.

Because he‚Äôs neighbors and best friends with my sister and her long term boyfriend, and because I really felt we had something real worth fighting for, I reached back out and we had a long talk on the phone. In short, we agreed to keep in contact since he saw the possibility of there being an Us. But since then, all the effort has been on my end, and i get nothing but short one to two word answers. 

Reddit, I do not understand how such a 180 is possible. If i can‚Äôt believe words, and if actions can lie too, what is left to have faith in? This has utterly broken me, as I was sure we‚Äôd come out of the weekend a couple, with the strong possibility of marriage a few years down the line. 

TLDR I fell for a guy who reached out because he regretted not getting to know me. His actions both in person and over the phone demonstrated strong affection for me, bur It fell apart after an amazing weekend and neither my friends nor I can make any sense of it. Do I keep trying? Maintain some sort of presence in his life? Its how my sister got with her boyfriend, he just stuck around no matter what she said.",

dating,146xx2f,2023-06-11 16:14:30,Girlfriend called me horrible names to another guy yet claims she loves me,"Hi everyone,

My girlfriend (24f) and I (24m) had a bad series of arguments and we broke up. After we broke up, she went to her guy friend which was someone I‚Äôve been suspicious of since the beginning, and texted him pictures of me and called me weird, a crybaby, and a b*itch. 

Fast forward a week, my girlfriend and I start talking again and one of our boundaries is emotional cheating and how we shouldn‚Äôt go talk to other guys about our relationship problems. I had asked her if she talked to anyone during our break which originally was supposed to be a break up (we‚Äôve broken up in the past but it just turned into a break).

She claimed no and she was reassuring me no for weeks and would even send me screenshots. It wasn‚Äôt until I saw her phone where I saw these texts. I‚Äôm torn but she claims we were broken up. Although that may true, the way she treated and talked about me after our break up says a lot. 

She also lied all week when we were seeing each other and broke trust and hid texts, so I‚Äôm telling her that what she did was emotional cheating. Also, when we got back together, she told me that in her head, we never broke up and she only thought me and would never cross a boundary. I‚Äôm torn because she went to great lengths to hide these texts from me and send so many notes about she did nothing, plus she didn‚Äôt just talk about relationship issues, but completely degraded me. I think I lost all trust. Is the relationship over?

dating,146x90q,2023-06-11 15:47:07,Should I post myself with another girl to make her jealous? (IMPORTANT),"18M-18F - both in college. So I'm in an exclusive fwb with this girl. By that, I mean that we only kiss and sleep with each other, but are not a couple. We got to know each other in late March, we went out a lot since then, had sex almost every time and we vibed very well. In early May, I told her I liked her, she said she liked me too but needs time to think because she was scared of commitment, she also had a 3-month rule where she would not get into a relationship with anyone before knowing them for 3 months. She suggested we become exclusive and postpone the relationship thing till later because I was gonna travel for 6 weeks at that point. I'm currently traveling on vacation and have 2 more weeks until I go back to her.

Before I left, we agreed that we were gonna call a few times per week and do one online activity together per week (Netflix, online games, etc..). When I traveled, she did not look like she was THAT interested in this, so I honestly never pushed to make it happen and she never brought it up either. Throughout the first 2 weeks of long distance, I was putting in most of the effort, but she was always down to go on calls and she would talk ( we usually called once a week ). I think it's also important to note that she is a full-time university student and works 2 jobs (usually 6-12 hours every day in just jobs).

2 weeks ago, we called for 20ish mins and she looked very stressed so I decided to be nice and door dash her favorite cookies to her place. Her reaction was not as good as I expected, but at least she looked happy, and made her day better. After she said thank you bla bla, I liked the message on iMessage and have not texted since to see if she would text first. It's been almost 13 days and I got no text from her. 

Part of me is telling me she's busy, she has no reason to text you when you're overseas and can't meet her in person, and that I should just not text her either until I'm back. The second part of me thinks she's fucking someone else rn. We are exclusive tho so maybe I'm just overthinking. 

I know the obvious answer is: communicate with her. But should I really do that? we are not really in a couple-type relationship and I don't want to seem clingy when I'm overseas and can't meet her for 2 more weeks. 

So I went on a date here with this very attractive girl. I don't really have interest in her and I made it clear with her after the date, but I did take a photo of her with the food at the restaurant that we ate in. Should I post it on my close friends Instagram story to make her jealous and possibly put more effort? or is that just gonna backfire in her doing the same thing? I still got 2 weeks overseas so it's risky. 

Please advise me on what I should do. Thanks a lot! 

TLDR: FWB has not texted me in 2 weeks. Should I post myself with another girl to make her jealous?",My goal right now is to maintain the fwb with her. I don't really care about the relationship that much anymore.

I‚Äôve been picking up that he likes me over the past month, but he‚Äôs never said anything about it, made me uncomfortable or done anything weird so I figured he liked me but understood that I was not interested. 

Last night it was pouring rain and he asked if he could crash I said sure. Before I went to bed he said ‚Äúcan I sleep in your bed‚Äù I said ‚Äúno you can sleep on the couch‚Äù and that was it.

I‚Äôve been chatting to this girl for about a month, she‚Äôs my mates gf‚Äôs friend and things were going well. I met up with her and we were quite drunk but spent the whole time with her arms wrapped around me. Second time was a bit more awkward but we got on, she was leaning against me and we didn‚Äôt stop chatting once we started.

Now a few days ago we met up again and it was just not really the same, and her replies got a bit worse but then she always said how much she liked messaging me. She says flirty things but then also treats me like just a friend, lots of mixed signals. Saying stuff like she‚Äôd happily come over and join me in my bed when I said it was uncomfortable, and just random compliments and shit. But also calls me mate and bud when she doesn‚Äôt know what to say.

Yesterday I was drunk and so was she and I just text her and ended up just saying that I couldn‚Äôt tell what her intentions were and she just avoided the question, went to bed later and now she‚Äôs being really standoffish and weird.

Her mate said she likes me but also isn‚Äôt looking for anything serious which I don‚Äôt really care I just want answers so I don‚Äôt waste my time. She switches up quite a lot so idk if it‚Äôs just that or if I‚Äôve fucked it? 

She told me not to be jealous about her talking to someone I can‚Äôt remember what and I said I would have been a week or two ago and she seemed annoyed about that? And she said that when we met first she didn‚Äôt think I liked her but that‚Äôs all I got out of her 

Anyone got any advice on how to approach this? Or what‚Äôs happening? I think I‚Äôve accidentally friendzoned her a little and she got the wrong idea? Or she‚Äôs just trying to be nice? 

I‚Äôm not one for relationships or anything I usually just focus on improving myself so idk what‚Äôs going on ‚ùì

dating,146w8v3,2023-06-11 15:05:55,I‚Äôd convinced myself I was unattractive and not worth dating; now a cute girl wants to go on a date with me and I‚Äôm terrified,"
I‚Äôve always been an ugly duckling and growing up I had no romantic experience, I really got myself down about it and it really messed up my self esteem but over time I started caring less and less and just numbed myself to it. I still have really bad self esteem but I don‚Äôt torture myself over it all, I just had the attitude of it is what it is. I‚Äôd missed too many milestones, I was too far behind, I wasn‚Äôt attractive and I was too boring, so how could I ever date anyone?

Lately though things have kind of changed. When I go out women flirt with me. I get quite a few matches on dating apps and a few times it‚Äôs almost ended up in a date. But there‚Äôs like some part of me that still fundamentally believes nobody could ever want to date me even though it‚Äôs an irrational thought. I‚Äôd totally convinced myself nobody could possibly be attracted to me, and I end up getting in my own way when it comes to dating. I‚Äôll not respond back with flirting, I‚Äôll ghost people who seem interested on dating apps and find some minor fault that means we won‚Äôt be compatible, etc.

Last night I matched with a girl on tinder who I‚Äôd have said was out of my league. We totally just hit it off. She‚Äôs smart, she‚Äôs funny, she‚Äôs cute, I got her number and we were texting for hours and she said she was really attracted to me and loved talking to me and that she‚Äôs down for going out and grabbing drinks.

And I‚Äôm terrified. Because now this is making me have to confront all my fears and anxieties. Cause there‚Äôs the truth; people can want to date me, people can be attracted to me, and I can‚Äôt run away from it all forever out of fear. I can‚Äôt rationalise my way out of the fact we have chemistry, I can‚Äôt find a single reason not to go on a date apart from my own insecurity, and if I don‚Äôt take her out I‚Äôm basically just admitting that it‚Äôs nobody else that‚Äôs the problem, it‚Äôs me.

I can‚Äôt keep letting my anxiety and fear dictate my life. I‚Äôm just so terrified to go on a date, I‚Äôve never been on a real date in my life, I‚Äôve never had sex, etc., and what happens when she realises how inexperienced I am, or how ridiculously nervous I am, or a million other things that could go wrong happen? My instinct is just to stop replying to her and forget it happened, but I realise how unhealthy it is. I can‚Äôt keep living like that forever, I need to face all my fears at some point, but it just feels so overwhelming.","A lot of people grow up being bullied and then when they are an adult they don‚Äôt realize everything has changed. I was an outcast and pretty unattractive in high school, well as an adult I became healthier and got a great body, but for years I acted as my same insecure self.

I'm not actively looking for a relationship, however whenever I've approached women I genuinely like, they seem really turned off by my missing arms. We always seem to get along until I reveal I'm armless, or if they know beforehand, until going on that first date. 

It's kind of tiring and disappointing. What can I do about it? (Pls don't suggest prosthetics). Also is it an instant deal breaker for you? Be brutally honest. 

Yes, I've sat down and reflected, I'm confident that it was me not having arms that turned these specific women off and not some other factor. Some even straight up told me lol.","I‚Äôm really sorry to hear about your experiences OP but I will answer honestly as some people on Reddit tend not to. I wouldn‚Äôt necessarily call it a dealbreaker per se, if I happened to get to know a guy with no arms and I started liking him, I would pursue it definitely. But, I don‚Äôt think I would actively get to know someone without arms, in a romantic sense. 

Being brutally honest: it‚Äôs not unattractive at all to me, not in the slightest. It just feels inconvenient (sorry if this sounds mean, I couldn‚Äôt find a better word). But, it wouldn‚Äôt stop me from getting with them if I genuinely had feelings for them. Hope this helps and good luck to you in finding love! You sound like a really sweet and genuine guy!

I am 25M. I work 8 to 10 hours a day so that only leaves evenings to get out there.  
  
Mon - Bible study  
  
Tues/Thurs - Climb with friends  
  
Wed - Chores  
  
Fri - either dinner with friends at a pub (I dont drink personally) or a walk in a local nature area/park.  
  
Weekends - Im usually doing something. Skiing, climbing, going to the farmers market, I recently joined a volleyball group which I found through friends.  
  
I have also asked friends if they know of anyone but that always turns up dry so I dont ask that often.  
  
So beyond what I do, what do people mean by ""put yourself out there""? What else can I do? I am social and friendly whenever I meet people. But no one really seems to notice me, or notice that I am single. Even if I try to flirt and ask girls out. On top of that it seems that no one else is single. Like today I went to the local farmers market and everyone near my age was holding a kid or with their partner.  
  
Please dont mention online dating. I have tried that extensively but never got any matches so I have given that up.","Are there any weekend church events you can go to?

dating,146tyfy,2023-06-11 13:28:05,Is she interested or just being friendly?,"I am following a specific class once a week and since a few months there is a new girl in this class. For a while we have been greeting (like a nod or a simple smile) each other when passing by in the hallway without having talked before. 

I really wanted to talk with her, since she seems very nice and looks attractive. The thing is, during this class she is always with two other friends, so it is difficult to start a conversation. Eventually I did manage to speak with her a few times, but the talks we've been having were very brief and really basic smalltalk. 

Now when she sees me when I am in another class or when she is passing by she always has a big smile and sometimes even waves enthousiasticaly at me. However, when she is with her friends she doesn't do this and completely ignores me. This also happens when we are in the same class and her friends are there. She doesn't even acknowledge my existence. 

Is she interested or just being friendly? Should I, when I manage to talk with her alone, aks her out or not? 

Hopefully the story makes a bit of sense. Thanks in advance for your insights.","You should shoot your shot, you won't know unless you aks her. Make sure you ask her when she's alone. She might be embarrassed to agree in front of her friends. Be cordial and polite even if she rejects you."

Usually I only get around 10 or 15 a day from women.

Another huge factor is that the men that swiped on me were really really good looking. I'm talking Calvin Klein model type shit. Half of the guy dudes on there were looking for something serious, the other half something casual. If you're wondering why I looked into their profile if I'm not interested in men, it's because I wanted to know out of curiosity from the men thag are into me, what sort of dudes are interested in me. 

In real life, I've been cold approached by a dude two times in public asking if I'm into men, which I'm assuming is implying they found me attractive. I've never been approached by a girl though.

On reddit, I made a post on a sub with my face in it and got a FOURTEEEEN DMs from men, most of which were pretty direct and flirty which sorta stroked my ego, but it left me wondering with all this what's up since I've never had a girl slide in my dms on reddit. 

Do you all think men have lower standards for men than women have for men? Maybe I just look a certain way that men find especially attractive or maybe there some other factors at play.

I would get a steady stream of matches (although some never even responded to me) and be invited on dates. I'm not saying this is an arrogant way to go - I just know it's not too bad for an average looking woman like me.  
  
So far, I've talked to two men about their dating experiences. One is a friend of mine and the other is a guy I just dated today. Both are pretty good looking guys and very nice. They both told me that they had a hard time even getting a match, let alone a first date. It made me feel bad for them, especially the guy I went on a date with today, because he was really a cute guy. I could tell he was nervous. ...... When he said he had no luck and was surprised that I had matched him, it really got me thinking. Is it common for even cute people to struggle to get dates? It seems like the world of online dating is frustrating enough, but maybe it's so hard for men.

dating,146spwm,2023-06-11 12:28:48,When do you start seeing other people,"*STOP not START 

I had a great first date. Texted him first and told him I had a great time and that ""next's one on me"".

Second date yesterday. Took him to lunch, had a more thorough personal conversation, he offered to pay half but I told him no lol (said maybe next time or we can take turns lol). Went back home, got funky, had a lot of fun and he had to go back home that same night because he's got return ticket home.

At the lunch date, I did tell him I don't like two-timing people and I much prefer to keep talking to on person at a time. He said it depends on the person so it's understandable. But the night was a great and he couldn't perform (but he did drove me over the edge and I got there in the end - even managed to do a porny-thing I never thought I could do!). He looked so happy he managed to do it lol

So now we're getting to the 3rd date.

I was thinking I'd tell him I want to stop talking to other people and see if he thinks we could do that together. I just really like him and he said the same thing, and he texted me today to say he'd love to see me again. But at the same time, I don't want to rush him.

Is the 3rd date okay or should I wait a little longer? And what about the other matches? Do I meet them still? (Tbh I don't feel like it because I really, really like this guy)

\*This is the first time I started (real) dating and while I do have some matches, he's so far the one's that straightforward when setting the date (he literally set up a meeting after we got to know each other on Bumble) and he's consistently been texting me since","It sounds like you're really enjoying getting to know this guy, which is wonderful! When to become exclusive or stop seeing other people really depends on the individuals involved and the pace at which your relationship is progressing. If you feel comfortable and ready to have the exclusivity talk, the third date could be a reasonable time. 

That said, it's crucial to be open about your feelings and not pressure the other person. Explain why you feel ready to stop seeing other people, and ask him how he feels about it. 

As for your other matches, if you don't feel like meeting them because you're really interested in this guy, it's perfectly okay to focus on him. However, it's advisable to keep an open mind until you both agree to exclusivity.

Remember, every relationship is different, so there's no absolute right or wrong answer. It's all about how both of you feel and what makes you comfortable."

dating,146sbvt,2023-06-11 12:08:41,Am I screwed?,"i (M21) am currently in a bit of a strange situation. right now i'm attending university (online atm but transferring in aug) and work as a tech at a local pharmacy.

i've basically never dated. i went to a really small priv school up until junior year, and only made a few close friendships before i graduated. i've never kissed, held hands, etc. i have a complete lack of experience when it comes to the opposite sex. i'm currently using the dating app Hinge, and it's been pretty much a complete waste of time. it's the same in-app purchase/upgrade scheme that i guess all dating apps are based around now. 

i'm worried that my lack of experience at this age will be a turn off to most potential dating partners, especially when most guys have had multiple by this age. actually if i'm being completely honest, it's really affected my confidence and self-esteem. i feel extremely unusual and abnormal at times, like an anomaly or something out of the ordinary. it also makes me think that i'm not capable or masculine enough sometimes. i realize that i'm probably not the only one in this situation, but i guess since i expected it to happen by now it's sort of a repeating cycle of disappointment. but what do you guys think, is it as embarassing as i think for a guy in his early 20's to not have his first kiss?","Don't fret about it too much. My personal experience is that I had my first serious relationship at 22 towards the end of my time in college. Experience in anything can make you more confident at it, but consider that a lot of people's experiences may be negative or unpleasant as well. The key is to prepare yourself as best you can before dating: sort out your mental and emotional health so you're content and happy living single, you don't feel pressured to date someone to prove your self worth, and you are capable of honestly communicating your feelings with people.

After you've taken care of those traits, the rest isn't nearly as bad. The physical intimacy experience is easier to learn on the job if you're going into that with a mindset of respecting consent/boundaries, relaxing, and making sure you're both having a good time. There are books people recommend often that encourage prioritizing the woman's orgasm. I think it's called ""She comes first""."

dating,146rqch,2023-06-11 11:37:12,Dating sucks,"After some time, I am finally able to open up my heart again with someone. We are talking for almost 6 months online and since we haven't met in person (long distance) and I think he's not interested, we decided to just stay friends. But even if we just stayed friends, we talked everyday and obviously I developed feelings and got attached to him (I hate myself for that). However, when I found out he has started seeing other people, it breaks my heart knowing he will soon be in a relationship and I will be left out in the cold. I tried dating too but there's not much of a success since most guys I met only asked me out for fun and the good ones never asked me out or they would cancel. 

I feel so anxious and sad knowing that the ONLY person I finally opened up with, someone who's nice and understanding to me, didn't have feelings for me. I rarely like someone and it sucks that when it finally happened, it's non reciprocal. Dating sucks. I feel like there's really no reason for me to date anymore because I always end up getting broken hearted. I feel envious of other people who had a successful relationship, and it's always my dream to build a family.

dating,146rp8a,2023-06-11 11:35:39,I want to ask out the cashier at my local goodwill but I'm terrified..,"Hi everyone, so I'll try to make this as short as possible. There's this girl that works at goodwill and for the last few months I've been developing somewhat of a crush for her. I kind of think she likes me too because there have been a few signs (but I'm not 100% sure, I could be misreading) for example: she always uses the word ""hun"" to address customers, and in fact this is how she originally addressed me the first time she checked me out. However, as of recent, she's started addressing me as ""love"" ex: ""thanks love, have a nice day"". She's called me that on more than one occasion and I've never heard her call any other customers ""love"". Another thing she did that I think is a sign she likes me is that she gave me 3 stamps on my blue card one day out of nowhere (for those of you who don't know, some Goodwill's have a thing where if you spend $10 you get a stamp on your blue card and once you get 10 stamps you get $10 off anything in the store.) Now obviously, she's not supposed to do that but she did it for me, am I misreading this? 

Anyways, I've been thinking about her a lot and the plan I've come up with is to maybe slip her a note with something along the lines of ""hey, I think you're really cute, you can text me if you'd like, my name is ***** btw"" and then put my number obviously. 

Another idea I had was to maybe wait until one of the days where she's stocking items on the shelves so that there aren't a bunch of other customers/co-workers around and maybe just be like ""hey, it's 'her name', right? I hope this isn't awkward but i think you're really cute and you seem really fun, I was wondering if maybe you'd want my number?"" 

Does this sound like a decent plan? I'm just really scared because I don't want to misread and make it awkward because I shop at this particular goodwill a lot.. also, I've never actually really asked a girl out, I've always just met women on dating apps, so I'm just really nervous but I'm afraid if I don't I'll miss my chance.

*Edit* autocorrect","Go for it.  But not with a note.  Put effort into saying something.  I'd probably say something along the lines of ""hey I think you're cute and would love to talk with you some more and get to know you.""  Leave your number on a paper. But leave it at that.  Don't hit on her on the line unless she openly says she's interested. Leave her some time to think without the pressures of her coworkers, customers, and most importantly you. 

To avoid awkwardness afterwards don't dwell on the results of her response.  Keep conversation casual like it was before. It's only awkward if your too persistent or too emotionally affected by the response

Good luck"

I might get a rejection but at least I know she doesn't find me suitable and I can get on with my life. Otherwise, if we do become friends, it's more awkward because I might be friendzoned because the relationship was never established as anything more than friendship and its harder to move on as I've invested more into making a connection. Opinions?","Depends on the social situation.   


If the woman is part of your daily life, it's probably best to go the friends route and see if anything develops and have that conversation later.  


If the woman is just passing through your life, 100% don't beat around the bush. Shoot your shot and figure out if there is something there between you."
dating,146qed1,2023-06-11 10:23:15,I (M17) am trying to pursue this girl (17F) as I've discovered that we share the same feelings. But there's a problem. [Serious],"So, it's been a month of pursuing her, and it's worked out well (in fact, I could really say that I feel like she's the perfect one for me).

And as I've tried to seek approval from my parents, in order for the relationship not to be strained, and work out well, my mother told me quite a.... revelation.

I don't really know how to react to it, because I didn't really want to admit that it could be true.

Apparently, the girl has had two exes, and she told me that herself. But apparently, she has had history (w/sex) and apparently has been made an issue of (because the guy had done her, and made her the talk of the town, which brought her, and her family to so much shame. Which in the end led her to almost taking her own life, which was fortunately prevented.)

And now, my mother told me that she also has a massive disapproval of the girl, since she dresses skimpily (which isn't that big of a problem for me) and that she has had the history of getting her virginity taken, im which, she's really worried that if I were to end up with her, she's most probably going to leave me for another guy. 

I can say for myself that the girl is quite the innocent soul, and is what one would definitely love. I fell for her even more after knowing of that.

Before I get possibly jumped on or anything, I want to say that, if she's had exes, it's not a big problem for me, so long as the girl herself stays faithful, and really treats one kindly in kind, and is also willing to work on the relationship to make it work out. However, it's kind of a different matter since it concerns her virginity, and I'm not really that well-versed in this kind of matter, and I don't really know what to do with that in mind. I would most certainly hate it if the woman I love would turn for another man's dick if her boyfriend is away, but I don't also want to judge immediately after just hearing from one side only, I want to hear from multiple parties, in order to establish an unbiased opinion, but I don't really know if what others would tell me is actually factual and really true.

Please help me, enlighten me, because I love her, and I don't really know what to do now that this predicament has faced me, it's also my first time actually dating.","Where are you from? I don't think most people in the West really care about virginity in that way, especially not someone's parents. Also, you should probably realise that, at 17, it is more than likely that eventually you guys will grow apart and break up, you're so young and have a lot of growing to do still"
dating,146q301,2023-06-11 10:05:10,A good love story up to the 2nd date,"I met this girl a month ago, as we had to do a small class project (3ppl) for a common subject in my masters and watch a stream/work in the library. She was very well dressed, in heels and long blond hair; I remember feeling intimidated and me focusing on the work to avoid thinking of her, I got so much done in that hour and although it wasn't my intention, that impressed her. We started talking here and there, she made me a gift and the day of the delivery she invited me to her country (we are both international students). I don't usually wear cologne in class but you bet that day I had it on. I was leaving in a month by that time so I said we (and our mutual friend) should meet before.

After meeting a couple times, and many many signs from her (I was scared of misinterpreting them) I invited her to ""hang out"", clarifying, just us. Before the big day, which hasn't even arrived, we went to have some ice cream after a long day of studying. It was romantic, very messy with the ice cream but also funny. I'm kind of shy so when we parted, I was at her door and kissed her on the cheek. In my eyes it was awkward but I think it's still a win because at least my heart didn't break out of my chest and left me unconcious on the street...

Having to study hard these last 2 weeks is just adding fuel to the fire. I manage to concentrate but at night and when I wake up, her is all I think about; my heart aches and I am short of breath. Last night I was hoping it wasn't all a dream.

A day later I message her, to roughly let her know the plan for our date (I read it gives something to look forward, and well even though I believe she trusts me, it's better for her to know where she is going). Not gonna spill what happened in the convo, but we want each other. When I pick her up for the date, I want to embrace her by the hip, look her in the eyes and get really close, whisper how beautiful she is, ""may I kiss you"", kiss her on the lips, and gift her purple flowers. The evening after that would be glorious.

We then would go to the movies and watch The Little Mermaid, drink, dine, walk through a very very romantic place (this is Italy) and I would accompany her home. I have no ""sex"" thoughts on my mind, I don't want that to happen yet. However, I haven't in my life felt this need to have a woman in my arms, to run my hand over her blond hair and fair body, to kiss every inch, to feel her warmth on my skin. If the date goes well, perhaps she tells me to go upstairs, and we cuddle and whisper for hours, falling together asleep. ***Do you think she would like that? If you are a woman, would you like it?***

By then we will have less than 2 weeks left, and it's exam period so even less time. My mind may try to hide the fact, but my body knows it. I do not give a single damn if I have to take on a long distance relationship with her, but still, let's make the most of the little time we have.

***Do you think my love for her is true, have you ever felt this way? I'm a hopeless romantic, am I not***",

I'd like to meet someone organically. However, I work I a male dominated job. My favourite hobby is majority male. I don't drink or go to bars. I'm not exactly a social butterfly.

I have no idea what hobbies women have that I could join in on and meet someone cool. I'm always looking for fun new things, but it's always a sausage festival when I get into something. Every woman I've dated has never had a thing they do all the time that they're passionate about. 

Slight announcement about my delivery - I'm mildly autistic so apologies if this comes off poorly. I'm genuinely looking for someone special...","Don't get into a hobby just to meet women. Try new hobbies to find one you genuinely enjoy. Even if it's just men at a hobby event you're going to, get to know them and make friends.

dating,146phgv,2023-06-11 09:29:33,Opinios on relationship (f19)(m27),"So i've got two friends who are in relationship for 4 years, they broke up for a week a month ago (their second break up). Now they are back together and the ralitionship is a bit better but slowly going back to what it was. I talk a lot with him and with her, over the past month i got really close to her and she is an amazing person, who supports him no matter what. I talked to both a few times about ther relationship as well so i know both of their opinions. A quick summary:

Her: i love him but i know but relationship is not that healthy, right now i dont have a reason to leave

She does all the right things, goes the extra mile for him and so on.

Him: 
-low sexual attraction
-sees a problem in lack of common interests
-said he still doesnt really understand her after 4 years, as a person
-last two years of dating were bad
-bad communication outside of sex, they dont talk about anything really
-no common interests
-finds the realtionship pointless at times
-doesnt see the relationship with her in the future
-finds it hard to be with her at times

Some other things to mention, he often doesnt pick up the phone when she calls, likes to drink a bit too much, mentally not doing too well, before the break up, he'd often tell her he doesnt want to see her for a few days, he would prefer to spend time drinking than with her, no romantic dates, relationship is mostly about what he wants, they had little to no sex before the break up.

Since the break up, they didnt see each other for a week, then went back at it. For a week he was nice to her, a proper boyfriend, now it seems like he's slowly going back to the way he was. They do have sex almost everyday, but besides that...

My question, why do people stay in such relationships, for how long can such a realtinship last, why wont he just leave? Or she? I mean i know her reasons, the sex is good now and if she left she fears he would hurt himself or even commit suicide. How long till they break up again? 

His mom and dad are in loveless relationship and the way things are going my friends might end up in one as well. Im afraid he is just using her when he feels bad and for sex, is that possible?","Even if you know all the details about their relationship, you can't understand no matter how hard you try, because you never know how and what it feels like to be in that relationship since you only view them using a third persons point of view. Trying to fit on somebody's shoes is way too different than actually fitting those shoes. Another thing you can't understand them because you are not them, you have a different outlook on life, principles, morals, character, preferences, and more. In short, you're not her nor him just let them be, they're adults they know how life works. Don't meddle in their relationship it's theirs just be there if they need some help don't go overboard. One day those friends of yours will realize and then decide to end or continue things. Human feelings are complex the more you try to understand, the more you get confused."
dating,146p7jd,2023-06-11 09:12:53,Topics for first dates,What did you talk about on your most memorable/best first dates? What was it about the conversation that you liked the best?,"Travel, films,bucket lists, funny dating stories, music, favourite position etc"
dating,146oq02,2023-06-11 08:43:43,Did I catch feelings?,"So my friend, Cameron and I (both F22) just finished college at Texas A&M and decided to move to Houston for our new jobs/ big girl apartment, etc.   
Bit of a backstory about me, never had a bf, only been on a couple of casual dates, and kissed a few guys at bars (never had a first kiss, so I did the desperate thing of kissing random guys at bars one time when I turned 20). That's the extent of my sex life or lack thereof.   
I had never been in a serious relationship before in my life (my strict Catholic parents and my wanting to focus on school). I didn't get attached to anyone on the dates as the idea of being in a relationship gave me anxiety at the time. The times I made out with the guys weren't a good experience for me and the only thing I tasted was bad breath and weed. We didn't even spend a lot of time talking before too. None of them were very attractive. I just didn't want to be that loser who hadn't kissed anyone by the time they turned 20.   
Shortly after moving into the new place, we spontaneously decide to go out to a club downtown. We were pretty drunk but we see this cute group of guys there. Cameron and I single two of them out (Peter, M23, and Alex, M25). Both were cute and I hit it off with Peter and Cam with Alex. They ditched their friend group and spent the rest of the night hanging out with us. Sometimes after a few more drinks and shots of cheap vodka, Peter made the move to kiss me and I have no clue what it was, but it felt good.   
Someone explain it to me- was it that I found him hot and he gave me attention or was it cause I was drunk asf or both?  
Story continues-  
Cam and I go home for the night and I immediately pass out on my bed. I woke up in my hungover haze to a text from Peter asking me if I was okay and if he wanted to go out with him that night to another club. I agree, happily and oddly confused as to why a guy that I didn't meet from a dating app is taking interest in me. The club was lame so we decided to go back to my place. I don't pick up on signals if guys want to have sex or not, seeming as I am a virgin and the most I've done is kissed a guy.   
But we cuddled, talked, and made out for a bit and I was so oblivious to the hints he was dropping that he wanted to go to my bed. I liked cuddling with him, I didn't know how to describe it but I clearly had never done it with a non-friend before. I was expecting him to get up and leave soon, but he never made an indication to. I mean it was thundering outside and I offered him our guest bedroom, but he insisted on sleeping on my bed with me. Again, never did that before with a guy.   
We just made out a bit and I guess I started getting anxious. I mean things were getting streamy and I  wasn't prepared for anything beyond making out. I did hint that I wanted to sleep at that point and we both did pass out.   
We talked more in the morning. He was clearly shocked at my lack of experience and I was shocked at his abundance of experience. He said he'd never try to pressure me to do anything sexual and would never have sex with someone right away with someone who had a lack of experience.  However, he did say that he wanted to hang out again before he took his Uber home to his place. We both were on the same page about keeping it casual because the idea of the relationship still scared me (and still does haha).   
And we didn't talk all week for some reason. I was actually hoping he would text me first. I clearly had never been in the position where will he text me back, but here I was. I know I could have easily texted him, but I didn't know if he even wanted to hang out again. I felt used in a sense.  
I did reach out eventually that Friday if he wanted to come out with Cam and I that weekend and he said he and Alex were actually having a small party and that we could come. Alex and Cam had been casually talking all week.   
The party was fun and Cam and Alex were all over each other. I thought it was kinda cute. I knew she really liked him. Peter and I did talk and I did get to meet more of their other friends too. However, I couldn't help but notice that Peter's phone had several messages from a girl on Tinder. It looked like an active conversation and I think they were planning on meeting up soon based on the gigantic font on his full-brightness phone.   
It didn't bother me and I guess what happened last week was a one-time thing. Cam ends up crashing with Alex. I hang back and talk with Peter and some other people at the party. Just as I'm about to call my Uber home, Peter convinces me to stay and insists he'll drop me off in the morning. All he says is that his bed is big enough for the both of us and we'd just be sleeping.   
I agree and know that Cam and I can leave home together in the morning. However, instead of sleeping, Peter and I begin making out. This is the first time anyone has ever kissed me on the neck or grabbed my boob and I liked the feeling? I'm new to all of this.  
He asked if we could do oral and I chickened out. He said last week he wouldn't have sex with someone right away if they were inexperienced, but maybe in the heat of the night, would we have ended up having sex? He was really into everything in terms of foreplay.   
Nothing exciting happened after that. We all got up and had breakfast in the morning before the guys dropped us off. Everything kind of fizzled out. Alex ghosted Cam after that night, even though he told her he was interested in dating her. He just stopped replying to her messages. As for Peter and me, we did end up running into each other at another small party the following week from a mutual friend I had met at Peter's party. We hardly talked that night but he was super friendly to me.   
A few weeks later, I texted him if he wanted to come out with me, Cam, and some friends. He said he was going out of state for a work thing that weekend. He never asked me to hang out again, though.   
And after that, nothing happened.... we didn't really speak again. No bad blood, just dried out I guess.   
And the part that fucks me up is this. Why does it bother me? Why do I keep replaying those nights in my head and keep wondering what would have happened had we had sex? I just felt so turned on for the week after and I couldn't do anything about it other than masturbate.   
Is it something I said or did that make things fizzle? Or did he want sex from the start and I just couldn't see that?   
My biggest question- why is this still on the back of my mind? Why can't I get over him or what happened? Why am I hopeful he will reach out again or we can rekindle this casual thing? I clearly deserve better but why can't I see that? Is this because this is the most male attention I have ever received in my life?",
dating,146opt6,2023-06-11 08:43:22,AITAH for still having feelings for my ex?,"It starts with my ex-boyfriend (A). We have been together for almost 4 years, and I love him so bad. We laugh, we kiss, and he shows me that he loves me too. But the problem is, I'm the one who comes into his house, and we stay there. In our whole relationship, we stayed only at his house. He never shows me to his friends or family.  
  
It's just like I'm stuck in his house.  
  
One time I asked him, ""Let's go outside and go to a restaurant like a date,"" and he agreed, but he told me, ""Not now, maybe next week. Which I understand. But the date has come. I've been waiting and waiting for him to invite me to go outside, but nothing has happened. Just because I love him so much, I understand him and move forward, not to mention the date again. but when the time comes, I feel bored for always being at home, and our routine is always the same. So I decided to break up with him even though I love him so much and know that he is not yet ready for commitment. I feel like we are just playing.  
  
As the years passed, I met my boyfriend (B). We are happy and have been together for 3 years, turning 4 this year. That's the opposite of my ex; he shows me his world. I know his friends, I know his family, we go outside every day off, and we bond together, but the problem is that I love him (and I do love him) but not like my ex. Still, my heart keeps staying on my ex, and I want to forget him so bad. for the sake of my boyfriend now.  
  
One time, I accidentally saw my ex in a coffee shop, and this is when my heart started beating fast. We talked again and laughed for a long time after not seeing each other, and I really missed him. He asked me if I had a boyfriend now, and I said yes. I saw his sad face, and he told me that he missed me. We finished our talk and exchanged contacts. Since this happened, I haven't told my boyfriend.

dating,146nnss,2023-06-11 07:38:42,The current dating climate is making me suicidal.,"Let me preface this by saying I (27M) don't have any issue with getting a woman. There's several women that regularly contact me (toxic people always have something up with their phone) to ""perform""... this issue is, that I can only get laid. 

I can't get a relationship for the life of me. I could do everything right, & genuinely keep my expectations low... then I'll just get ghosted. Yet like some sick twisted joke, i could walk up to a random woman in bar. Look her dead in the eye, & say something like, ""I guess I'd let you choke me."" ... then somehow I'll end up back at her place.

Yes,  I've been in plenty of relationships... All of which have ended within 3 months for one of 3 reasons: 

my disorders being too big of a concern (type 1 bi-polar, severe anxiety, ADHD, OCD, & manic depression)

I find out their a genuinely bad person 

 or  I get ghosted for being to easy.

To my first point; I get why my disorders can be too much, but I actively do A-LOT to reign everything in. People are always shocked that I'm mentally ill. I train MMA CONSTANTLY to maintain my endorphins, & then try to process negative emotions. I write everything from poetry, to long form stories... I even refuse to drink alcohol when I'm depressed, & monitor my nicotine consumption when I'm anxious/stressed.

The last two points go sort of hand in hand... I genuinely belive how you love speaks volumes about you as a person, down to your most fundamental morals. This sometimes makes women think I'm a doormat, & one of two things happen: Usually I notice a series of manipulative plays, & break things off. The inverse is that I get dumped for not giving her some kind of conflict.

The kicker in all of this is... I have an IQ of 130. I could easily play ""games"" with dating... the thing is: playing games with someone's emotions is sociopathic. Now these games are officially the standard of dating.

sure there's no motivation to being a ""good man"", but goodness dies with incentives. What's torturing me is that being s decent man just gets you hurt now. While toying with women has many incentives, and even more securities.

To top all this off, I'm a romantic. I love doing those little, or possibly grand gestures to show my love. Everything from a text with a line of poetry I just came up with, to making every woman on the dance floor jealous of my date... yet all of those romantics get me tossed aside. 

Normally with a rant like this, there's some a egregious flaw that the OP is entirely unaware of. For years now I was trying to figure out what my flaw was. 

That's where the real tragedy hits, I'm always getting calls/run ins from exes... They're always crying about how some other man treated them after me. They'll hit me with the entirety of toxicity in all these talks. However; I'm always clear that I'm never going back to someone who hurt me so... not like any of them would leave the new guy anyway.

Do you any of you have any idea what this is like? Trying to just be a good person, & be a good man to someone you love... but women would literally prefer to be getting abused by a guy less attractive, less wealthy, worse in bed, & has no personality nor morality.

One ex ghosted me after I guessed her favorite flowers on valentine's day, now her new bf is a bald douche who manages (but really steals all the income from) her OF... that HE talked HER into. Obviously I hope she gets into a better situation, but that's just out of baseline human decency.

Another ex dumped me after I basically wrote all of her essays her first year in college. The guy she left me for made her drop out, & now viciously beats her... she posts old memories of us together on her snap whenever they argue. I tried getting her in contact with certain services for women in those situations, but ultimately gave up on her when she started defending that scumbag. 

That's why I want to just end all of this... I'm at this twisted impasse. Either I give in, & become a horrible person... or I die alone.",Hey man I think you need to take a break from women for a while.

dating,146m3vr,2023-06-11 06:05:46,How do you guys move on from past relationship?,"Long story short, about 5 months ago, I found out my ex boyfriend has been cheating on me with his ex coworker. After we broke up, he kept saying it was his mistake, he realized that he wanted to be with me. But since he is in military and he was about to move to different country, he wanted to pursue the relationship with me once he comes back to states. And i was super closed to fall for it. One day, i had weird thoughts on my mind, and i decided to show up in our apartment ( i moved out right away when i found out he has been cheating on me). I saw different girl was in our apartment. I don‚Äôt know how i did it, i knocked the door. And it turned out she was one of his trainees (he was military basic training instructor at that time). So I reported them for inappropriate relationship. Past 5 months were hell. I was crying all day, lost quite some weights. Due to this awful break up, i went to see psychiatrist and therapist. I had experience with hallucinations due to side effects from one of the meds. All of these happened in 5 months. People often say if you are brave enough to hurt yourself, you can overcome everything. But i‚Äôm not that brave to hurt myself. But i keep thinking i wish i could have cancer that runs in my family. I‚Äôm trying to focus on myself, to see bright side that i‚Äôm out of toxic person. How did you guys handle hard times like this?",
dating,146m348,2023-06-11 06:04:35,(F19) possibly interested in (M28) and not sure what to think of it.,"I (M28) have a job working out in forests on old buildings and my company frequently partners with corps that have younger groups. I'm not the type of guy who goes out looking for younger women or anything (my last date was over 2 years ago, last real relationship 4 years ago. I'm very out of practice with all this stuff üòÇ). Anyway, we've been working with this crew and one of them (F19) I found out has a lot in common with me and we really hit it off. I didn't think anything of it until tonight when we were having a great conversation around the campfire. She mentioned how we should hang out outside of work, she wants our dogs to have a play date and listen to music (which she has amazing taste in). There was that ""hard to leave the conversation"" feeling that I think we were both having and we ended up staying up way later talking than either of us should be. I'm usually in bed by 8:30-9pm and we both stayed out till 10:30 after everyone else was in bed by 8. I find her attractive, but keep getting hung up on the age gap and the work situation (relations are prohibited, but people break that all the time). So I guess my question is how weird would it be if this went somewhere? Or what are people's experience with this? At this point in my life I'm looking for a serious relationship (not that I would expect one) and don't really care about hook ups and (as someone that used to be that age) I know things are very short term for younger people. Also I just don't want people to think I'm a creep or taking advantage or something. Any advice?","Just don‚Äôt pressure or persuade (money/meals/sex) her for anything at all. If you actually like and she likes you, don‚Äôt make the first move. I would even be upfront about your feelings and say that ‚Äòyou don‚Äôt feel comfortable making any moves she doesn‚Äôt feel comfortable with. And if she would like to progress in a relationship she will have to be upfront‚Äô.  Something like that. If she says yeah I like you and feel comfortable with the age gap, okay."
dating,146lzhr,2023-06-11 05:59:11,What is your definition of a ‚Äúcasual relationship‚Äù?,"I‚Äôd like to hear some responses. Ty for reading in advance, summary at the end. 

A few months ago I (28f) dated a guy (29m) who I wasn‚Äôt initially attracted to (a few inches shorter than his profile stated which is a tough cause I‚Äôm a tall. He‚Äôs not conventionally good looking but still very handsome in his way (he actually looks a little like Pedro pascal)). However, we ended up really getting along, and having a lot in common. I liked being with him and the almost 10 hr date ended with a few nonsex happy endings. He especially impressed me with his skills‚Ä¶. 

The issue is he was relatively recently out a 5year+toxic relationship. He also wasn‚Äôt jumping to pay for my meal but I think I was probably the first to say we can split it, cause I liked him. But after years of being taken advantage of by boys and past BFs I‚Äôm really looking for someone who likes me enough to want to pay for my $10 meal on a first date.

He wasn‚Äôt messaging me afterward, no effort, like I never existed. I reached out with a few texts and he finally answered a funny meme a made about wanting to have sex üôÑ I should have known. My profile was very clear about not wanting hookups and he even brought it up before we met. He answered me saying ~ I really like you but I‚Äôm not ready for anything serious but I‚Äôd really like to see you again but be ‚Äòcasual‚Äô. I responded saying thats no problem, I‚Äôve been single for almost 6 years dating around. Naively, I didn‚Äôt assume that meant casually effing other people, just not committing. 

Anyway, I invited him to my house for dinner, I love to cook and his kitchen was completely empty when I was over so I wanted to treat him to a good meal. I wasn‚Äôt expecting to have sex because I currently wasn‚Äôt on BC and had not had sex (by choice) in over a year üíÄ however he ended up doing his thing, came prepared and I caved. He slept over and we had a great night.

He once again ignored me, and I like to think I have ESP. I just KNEW he was went out with someone that next week. He then reached out to me for the first time just to talk. Sus behavior cause he felt guilty I think. I ended up telling him I‚Äôm not interested in someone who doesn‚Äôt like me enough to text back within a few days and he came back with how sorry he was cause he‚Äôs busy and he wanted to talk it out in person. When he came over he came clean about having sex with someone else and I somehow already knew. I had also still been on the apps and had a date lined up for that weekend. He was visibly jealous and I was disgusted. 

It just sucked like we both obviously liked each other we had some very intimate moments that felt a lot deeper than I‚Äôve ever felt. I joked ina text after he left ‚ÄúI guess we just didn‚Äôt have a spark‚Äù (I had given him a flint fire starter bracelet I bought for him because he camps every weekend, I love gift giving) and he responded, ‚ÄúI think the issue is there are sparks, and that complicates things.‚Äù I responded, ‚ÄúIt didn‚Äôt have to be complicated.‚Äù

We‚Äôve talked a little afterward only cause I reached out cause I‚Äôm totally crazy and finally I find a guy I actually like, and he‚Äôs not ready for a stable relationship. Which I totally get after healing for 6 years. 

Summary: Dated a guy who wasn‚Äôt ready for a relationship and wanted something casual. I had no problem with that, however the week after we commenced the ‚Äòsituationship‚Äô he had sex with someone else. So tell me, when you want a casual relationship, does that mean it‚Äôs open to casual sex with any other girl you date? Sorry for the long story. I have been mauling over this for like 3 months.","I'm a woman, but if someone tells me they want something casual I'm assuming they want to hang out sometimes and have sex and we're not exclusive. Due to this, I'm not going to put in much effort. I'll show up, talk a bit, have sex, and then I'm out. I'll text minimally in between hanging out."

I always kiss on the first date so it came as a wasted case to me. But I decided to give her another chance since I remembered some people wait for 2nd or 3rd date for a kiss. My own mother also rejected my dad twice so it was worth a shot.

I invited her and she accepted.

I fear all forms of intimacy due to the unmentioned past, but I fear being alone forever more. I feel as if I constantly am at odds with all feelings I have.

dating,146l7gw,2023-06-11 05:14:22,I think ive turned into a penguin...,"What i actually mean is this. Apperently penguins only fall in love once. Ive been in love before but never like this before. The first few times were sudden and haphazardl. Spent most of my time fumbling through them before findingthe right answer and by then it was usually too late. 

Well fast forward to now. I have fallen extremely hard for not only my coworker but shes also one of my best friends. She gives me shit when i need it most. Keeps me in line and makes me think in ways ive never even imagined. Before her i had a fianc√© who turned into a monster as soon as i popped the question. I had never been at such a low point before in my life. Come to now. The one came into my life then. Helped me sort through all my bullshit. Saw my ugliness and still looked at me with loving eyes. A caring hand. I too helped her through horrible ugliness of her past ex. Then i turned into a jerk and pushed her away probably due to me being scared of losing her. And in that time. She found another guy who might actually be half decent but i havent met him yet and it honestly makes me physically ill to think about. 

I recently came clean to her and told her i was deeply sorry for how i was acting and how much she really means to me. How i want to spend the rest of my life with her. Her to annoy me and give me the little love punches she would do. I bought a promise ring and showed it to her to prove to her my seriousness of how deeply i love her and want a life with her.

Now shes the type to take a long time to decide on things. She has said to me that she always has something going on. And multiple people have said that to her in the past. I told her that i understand and that i would wait patiently for her answer. 

Me and her have been fwbs in the past to help eachother and to get over our exs. But in the meantime. We also fostered an incredible friendship. She still likes me i because she told me. And that she in the past wanted to pursue a relationship with me. I just so happened to do it about 4 months later when she told me about the new guy. My whole world began to shatter. I could barely eat anything for the following week and been that way since basically. 

I want to do everything in life with her. I want the fights. I want the crying. I want the laughter. I want the love. I want kids with her. I am so willing to give everything to her, all i need is for her to say yes and accept me. The only problem is that its hard as hell to sit and wait for an answer from her. Especiallysince she is still probably talking with the other guy. 

What do i do ? I bet everything on her. She is my soulmate. I can say it with utmost certianty because ive never met another girl like her and not any other girl has come even close to her in any way in my eyes. Ive tried going on dates. Ive tried doing nothing. Ive tried forgetting about her and my mind is never far from thinking about her. Never far from some way of how to be better for her. Never far from thinking on how to make her laugh. Or smile. Or to even brighten her day a little.",
dating,146l4id,2023-06-11 05:09:32,I (21M) am going to break up with my (21F) girlfriend. How do I handle this in the best way?,"For the past 2 years that we've been together, I've always had a feeling of being unsure. I love this person, I love being around this person, I love the times we've had together. But deep down I've always known that they weren't the one. Our incompatibilities have been glaringly obvious and this decision has felt like it's been building up. From our sex life, our world views, our morality, our humor, our goals for our future, our everything has felt like a challenge. We get a lot from each other, but I just can not see myself with this person for the rest of my life. So I think it's best for the both of us to not drag this out. 

Here's my problem: When I met my GF, she was extremely immature and generally inexperienced with life as a whole: She didn't know how to be a independent functioning adult. I've spent the past 2 years teaching her and growing with her and now we have an apartment together for the next 10 months, which neither of us could afford alone. She has major issues with her family and constantly tells me how happy she is to live with me and away from them. She has tremendous abandonment issues and severe trauma. And not to speak poorly of her, but with her ADHD and potential autism (it's obvious, just not diagnosed) she has difficulty with simple tasks of life. Together we relearned what relationships should be and I've provided a safe place emotionally/sexually/physically. To leave all of that is really really difficult. So I need to find the best way to help her stay on her feet and continue on her path without me. 

I love her to death, but I can no longer be with her. Where do I start?",You can start by not starting

dating,146l1ok,2023-06-11 05:05:07,Why the girls I used to date were all about upseting me when I saw them again in public?,"Didn't know where to vent. It's going to be a bit long but I'll keep my best to be short lol It is the weirdest thing that happened to me this year.

3 years ago, I used to date this girl from university(let's call her S). She lovebombed me at first and I fell for it really bad. We used to hangout and kiss and cuddle but then she would play the hot n cold. She checked all the boxes of being a narc. After a couple of months of uncertain dating, she discarded me out of blue and telling me lots of bad stuff. I found out she had returned back with her ex. It took me a lot of time to recover as everything was ruined. My self esteem, feeling blue all the time, and very bad thoughts. But I moved on nonetheless, learned a lesson and ingored her for the rest of the year.

When I got better, I met a girl at a movie event(let's call her G). Everything was going nice and dating every day. She told me she had an abusive past and wanted to take things slow. I said no problem and see where it goes without getting too attached. After a couple of weeks she began to play hot and cold and play mind games. I spoke with her that I didn't liked it and it's better to stop dating if she behaves like that. She got mad. But still tried to contact me. I sent her a final message and told her to leave me alone.

Then last year I went for a hiking 3-day trip with a group of people on the internet. When I arrived at the bus that was going to transport us, I saw S too. Still ignored. I met a nice girl during the trip and shared a few moments. S got in the middle, befriended her and was doing her best to sabotage us. She would come and knock on my hotel room's door and tell me how sorry she was. The more I ignored her the worst it got. The new girl I met just told me that she didn't want any drama and didn't talk to me again. So I said to myself to hell with it and met with S. We spent the last night together in my room and had sex. When we got back, she became too clingy and needy. She was lovebombing me all over again. Acting all nice and telling me to accept her back in my life and yadda yadda. Then she told me she was going away for a month and wait for her and not to fool around. Which was a lie because I already knew from a mutual friend that she was going away start a job with a 1 year contract. I still had some anger from the first encounter and waited for her to leave the town. I didn't want to end it face to face because I knew how crazy she would get and try to revenge. I made sure she reached on the other side of the world and called her and told her to cut every form of contact because I didn't like anything about it. And I just ghosted her, until she stopped texting me for days and gave up.

A few weeks went. I was walking down the street when I saw G right in front of me. She stopped me and hugged me. I was confused. Then she asked me for a coffe. Again, I said to myself to hell with it. We had a long conversation and she told me that she wanted to date again, but this time in a serious way. I agreed but didn't trust her. We had sex and we both enjoyed. The more times we had sex, the more she would become clingy and overracting on everything. But I could see with my eyes closed that it was all an act. I could tell that she was not only unstable but also dating other people. But still I wanted to get physical with her and do my own act. Then she blocked me out of blue. We didn't had any fight and we didn't had any slight disagreement. I laughed it off and went with my day forgetting the whole situation with her.

Forward to this week. I had been in a trip to Africa and went to Egypt to get to my plane and return back home in Europe. Out of every single country in the world, I saw S at the passport check queue at the airport. Once she saw me(we were 2m close in the line). She was with a group of friends and once she saw me she became furious. She was trash talking out loud and making sure I could hear. And making fun of me in a subtle way. She even started to talk with every other guy around and flirt with them. I was holding back my laughter because of how pathetic she looked like. But still made it through.

Today I went with a couple of my friends at a bar. Guess who was there. G! Once she saw me there, she started to talk to every other guy on the bar. She even tried to flirt with my friends but was unsuccessful. Than she tried to catch my attention but I was ignoring her all along. She came right next to me and told me that I was a bad person for not trying to reach to her, and that blocking me was to test me. I laughed and told her I dodged a bullet there and she did me a favor there. Oh boy, her face turned red and was fuming and mumbling. Then she left in a hurry.

So far it is been a really confusing week. Don't know what to expect anymore. But still I don't understand their behavior and why they had so much anger for me when they were the first to try and play me. Maybe they got hurt for not doing whatever fucked up scheme and manipulate me. But still after all this time it feels quite bizarre. My friends told me that I'm the problem for dealing with these kind of girls. And I feel bad right now for going through them again. I just want to erase them from my past like I've never met them.

Tl;dr: Dated two girls on two different periods of time each. Got discarded and ghosted, and did the same. During this week, I was in the same place with them by coincidence. And they acted in public trying to make me upset and whatnot.",

dating,146kv9b,2023-06-11 04:55:12,"Feeling a bit lost, would appreciate some advice.","Hello all, this is my first time posting here, not entirely sure what to expect.

To start, some background about me. I am a male that is currently 18 and going into my second year of college. 

Starting from about a year and half ago, I have been on a major self improvement journey. Complete diet, fitness, emotional, and mental reformation. I feel I have a very good physique, style, and I feel very well read. I am also on an entrepreneurial mission to build a product as well. 

The beginning of some of these changes were to build myself into the man I want to be, but also the man that women would want.

I have been in several relationships before, but recently it's been pretty dry, and I haven't had a solid actual partner in about 9 months.

The problem is that I feel extremely lonely romantically. I have friends that I consider to be brothers, family that I can rely on, but I long for something more.

A main challenge is that my college is a tech school that is 66% male, and most of the women there are unavailable, making things challenging. 

My main question is just where do I find women exactly? I have tried dating apps to no avail, most of the experiences from that feel shallow and the whole process feels disgusting. I also feel that most women rarely use those services anyway. I want something real and at least somewhat long term.

I would also like to find a way to practice building confidence in some form, as I think it needs work.

Any help/advice would be appreciated.",

dating,146kp6f,2023-06-11 04:45:41,[UPDATE] I dislike everyone around me because they're annoying.,"Hi again, I don't really remember how long ago I posted my last part to this but I know it was recent. Please stick with me and don't judge my writing because English is not my first language. I also have to post this in a different category (sorry I don't use reddit often)

So it's been awhile and I guess I really am indecisive. Yeah my friends are hella annoying and I really don't like them, but I don't think I'm aromantic. I think I like C again and I don't know how to tell R. I don't even know IF I SHOULD tell R. Last time I told R about my feelings everything got really awkward. What I didn't include last time is that after I told R I liked C a few days went past before I said I didn't like C, and in that timeframe was the most terribly awkward situations. R is one of those people who really like, I think it's called MLM? But R fetishizes gay people, mainly men. Both me and C are men. I think the main reason I lost interest in C at the first point was because the continuous subtle jokes from R about me and C giving each other sexual pleasure. Example, if I lend C a pencil because he didn't have one R would speak up and be like ""oh just give each other head at this point"" ??? 
I really do think they are annoying but I don't want to leave R or C. (Plus I'm kinda into C again, I'll explain later)
During one of those days R ""subtly"" asked me if I wanted them to push me into C and I'd land on top of him. (This isn't some fantasy, that would hurt.) I obviously told them no, and that ""that was a stupid idea"" but they just giggled it off. I eventually got really tired of it and just decided to force my feelings away. (you'd know if you tried it doesn't work all that well, so they've always been lingering) I tell R something along the lines of ""hey can we tell C that the secret I was keeping was I was Inlove with his mom. (Mom jokes)"". Because prior, ask another joke, R said I had a secret about C TO HIS FACE!! not cool. R obviously agrees after I tell them I think I'm aromantic. (I'm not, I just thought I was) after that R is like, ""oh I don't like C either, I'm going to go after the senior instead.) R is 15, Senior is basically and adult. Weird but okay. Let's call the senior S. S was also into R at the time but didn't act on it. S also made a joke about kts so often, I then R and S would fit because they are both stupid. But R has been with my so long, I don't want to abandon them. So stupid of me I know, but I just can't bring myself to.
Anyways, explaining how I caught feelings for C again. So after me and R broke up we really didn't talk to much to each other online unless it was for advice or important stuff, so I've talked to C way more then any other of my friends. C is cool, he's really pretty and has amazing music taste, he's introverted which I hate but I can be an extrovert for him, it's whatever. I've always been a little nervous to tell him how I feel because he's intimidating. Imagine a 5'4 guy with too many piercings, bleach blond hair, and very ""punk"" like clothing. Me and him are kind of opposites in style. I really wear baggy pants and shirt and then a huge jacket to top it off. I'm pretty basic but I'd like to think I look nice. C is very honest and shares at of interests with me, except a few (like gaming, who doesn't like to game?! He plays the sims 4 only really. {I forced myself to play that game and like it to relate to him}) we always talk well and really never run out of stuff to talk about. He doesn't really like dark humor so I've been stopping using a lot of that, but he lets it slide when I make a racist joke about my own race (I'm Hispanic). Sometimes we jokingly flirt and used flirting emojis like ""üòòüò≥üòèüòçüòô"" but I know he means it as a joke. Back when I was around early 14 me and R were together (we are poly) we would make jokes about us both marrying him, but he'd always deny and say he was with our parents and don't want to break their hearts. (Okay weirdo??) But I recently found out he's reread those conversations over and over a lot of times, so I'm think I either maybe have a chance, or he ignored what I told him about R and fell inlove with them. But then again I don't think I have a chance because I really don't know how to express myself and I say ""I hate you"" or ""kys"" or ""die"" to him a lot. He's really the only other person I talk to other then my mom. guys I don't know what to do, I forced my feelings for R so this is my first time every really liking someone. I'm kind of nervous, and I feel like I don't have a chance at all. I know I'll never know until I try but we've all already made plans for the future and if I ask him out and he rejects me we'd either give those plans up or awkwardly stick together, remembering that time I confessed. This isn't really me asking for advice but it's me trying to get this off my chest. I don't know if I should tell R or what. I feel like I can trust them even though how they reacted the first time. I know they'd make this awkward again but I just want to tell someone, this is eating me alive.",
dating,146kfhd,2023-06-11 04:30:55,"Getting frustrated with being single, would love to read your success stories",Would love to hear your story about how you meet your partner and any details/advice that would help someone who is growing impatient with being single,"Hey! I serial dated throughout my teenage years and into University. It broke me completely, as I felt empty and alone by the end of a series of unhealthy nights- everything was transactional and there was no empathy, honesty, tenderness, or care. 
Then, I snapped out of it; I stopped giving myself away to people that did not know me or deserve me. I figured out my wants and needs, then found someone who could fulfil them: handsome, kind, charming, humorous, lively, reserved when necessary, aligned with politics, a romantic, respectful, charismatic, kitschy, and SOOO much more!! 

1. Stop living for other people, as it will hijack your anticipatory thoughts and emotions. Find your own path in life: you are allowed to be selfish, do not anyone anything emotionally, and entitled to explorative years through singularity. 
2. Find a community and engage with it. EX: political activism, internships, spirituality (yoga, church, etc.), schools, professors, counsellors, physicians, mentors, family dinners, etc.
Note: be cautious about telling friends and family members about certain dreams and ambitions, as they may be jealous, insecure, or downright cruel about it. As an immediate result of, they may attempt to derail your progress- this is a symptom of their insecurity, not yours.
IMPORTANT: you will typically find a partner by doing things you love and value. I met my boyfriend in a German lecture. We sat next to each other every day for an entire semester; we were strictly friends for six months before considering a date.
What do you love? Is it running? Great! Join a run club and train with a group‚Ä¶ you may meet someone your own age. 
3. Love yourself before you give love to someone else. As my mother always said, ‚Äúcheck yourself before you wreck yourself‚Äù; as my father always said, ‚Äúbecome the person you want to date, then the match will follow‚Äù. 
4. Proper exercise, nutrition, and sleep hygiene. Seriously. Do not get sloppy with this. Take care of yourself, please.
5. Replace social media with books and make a goal of reading one book per week. What is your screen time? Exactly. Replace it by reading something you take an interest in. 
6. Stop using people for validation or gratification. If they give you a compliment, then accept it with grace and gratitude.
7. Dress sharp! Are you male? Great, women love jeans and polos- something suave that makes you appear confident (even if you aren‚Äôt). Are you a female? Great, males love women in dresses with dainty jewelry. 
Overall: dress for yourself, but also know that you need to be appeasing a certain gaze to find success. Traditionally, males and females are looking for someone with a classical, elegant, refined look."

He invited me over to watch the NBA final and I thought that maybe I could be close and personal w him. I was turned off pretty quickly. His place was kind of a dump. We decided we were going to watch the NBA final (his team lost btw).

He asked me to make out after the first commercial. I said no. I also said I would give him 1 kiss but I literally chickened out saying his breath smelt like whisky. By the 2nd half he wanted to go into his bedroom. I said no. Then I left. To his credit he was nice and understanding.

It got me thinking‚Ä¶ wow I really am the kind of girl who can‚Äôt put her mouth on a boy who she really doesn‚Äôt like. I could have kissed him but he also didn‚Äôt contribute. I ended up feeling queezy. Someone please tell me I‚Äôll feel better w a man one day!","If it helps. You shouldn't consider that a date. It was an attempted hook-up from his end. Also...

Wow you are brave. I know it sucks to think this way. But so much could have happened going to a man's house that you've never dated yet üò¨.

I'm glad you are safe. That you didn't just do what he said. But you should just remove that night from your mind. Block him. And start fresh. GL out there and stay safe."

Before then I was so involved with school and work and also quite content with the love I received from my friends. When I started dating guys I always thought my heart, personality, interests/hobbies, and pretty decent looks would be enough. But it doesn't appear to be, I find men even those my age have lived so much and have been to so many places and dated so many people and here I am feeling like a child. I never really left home commuted for college and just live humbly, I guess dating made me realize how mundane I am. Don't get me wrong I could talk about anything for hours and I've accomplished a lot in academics and my field (I work in mental health with the elderly) and am very passionate about it. But I just can't help but feel it's not enough, am I missing something?","although everyone moves forward at their own pace, its unfortunate you are unable to find it relatable from those around you. others simply focused on a different path than yours, theres nothing wrong with you and you arent alone. you sound quite successful with all that you have accomplished with your career, you are anything but mundane. you still have the luxury of catching up, just keep moving forward. continuing to compare your journey and experiences with others will hold you back and doubt yourself."

dating,146idn0,2023-06-11 02:40:41,Why do people throw so much negativity at guys that vent about woman in the dating scene?,"Something I‚Äôve come to learn growing up is that if you‚Äôre a man well then the world just does not care about you or you‚Äôre problems. You could‚Äôve have risked your life for someone else and if you see in need you will be brushed aside . 

This is especially true with woman when it come to dating. I know ima get backlash for this but I don‚Äôt care ban me if you want. But let‚Äôs be realistic dating heavily favors woman to begin with I mean a great modern example of this is dating apps.

Dating apps overwhelmingly favor, women that‚Äôs just a fact and that mirrors are real life everyday lives. You‚Äôll certainly have more of a chance With a girl in real life rather than on a dating app but you‚Äôre still fighting at a disadvantage.

I also think modern modern feminism is pushing a very toxic view of men to women, all this to say this is also heavily affecting the dating scene as well.

But my big problem is whenever I see this stuff talked about or called out or see any type of criticism directed towards woman in regards to those subjected . I see either a whole lot of men of all things attacking other men or woman just gaslighting these men into think men are just the problem deflecting any type of criticism and offering nothing to the conversation .

Funny enough guess who is taking The most vocal stand against this type of behavior? Yup other women the girls are standing up for the guys and it does make sense this effects them too.

dating,146i87j,2023-06-11 02:32:45,"I started feeling like I (27F) treated him(30Œú) badly and somehow regret , please help!","I ( 27F ) met this Egyptian man (30M)- Mohamed  while on holidays and we had  a short term relationship, we were talking to meet again and told me when I come again I can stay in his house .

From the day I left we had daily contact and he was calling me , also texts and it felt like mutual interest.  During the period I met him on my holidays I felt a genuine connection and a very strong attraction,  that I dont feel so often like this. During these holidays I met other 2 guys also but I didn't do anything with them , but one of the 2 was leaving romantic comments on my pics even though we didn't do anything . When I left, Mohamed was telling me to not talk to other guys,  not show my body and things like this..One morning and a few days after I left and I was at home , we were talking videocall , in the beginning we were casually talking but later on I started talking sexy to him and asked him what is he wearing right now and requested him to show me and things like this... I proceeded on taking off  my clothes and we made sexy videocall with mutual masturbation and he came in the end..

After,   the rest of the day he didn't text me anything which I found weird,  but I thought maybe its ok since we were talking for an hour in the morning.  I texted him good night,  I love you , we talk tomorrow and he didn't reply to me . I know he works until midnight and after midnight a lot of times because I was there and I saw it in my eyes while I was there..So I thought it was because he works.  But a bit later I saw he uploaded an Instagram story , so I started feeling concerned but again didn't put any pressure. 

I waited the next day , he wasn't connected until 18.00 pm when I texted him something because I was feeling pretty dissapointed with him. I just told him that real men don't dissappear like this and keep their word, also if he doesn't talk to me other men will.  Then I said that I felt he was different but he wasn't and i should have understand it when he had me waiting until 3 am because he was working ( I was there) and had me there waiting , but he could postpone some appointments since it's his own business. And i also said that this world is full of fuckers,  but the one who ultimately stays in your mind and heart is the man with feelings and respect. He then replied that he understood that I only wanted him for sex and not for who he is as a person or his personality which is not true . I said that this isn't true and I felt a genuine connection. I asked him what happened and his behavior suddenly changed and if he met someone else.  He said that he knows where I can find him and if I come he will welcome me . I replied that I will not come because I didn't see him only for sex and I was feeling pretty sad because I also tried to call him and didn't pick up. Also I said that if he was interested he would have offered to pay at least half of the tickets.  He replied he doesn't pay for anyone to visit him. I was feeling very sad and shocked with his cold behavior so in the end I texted him "" I hope you don't have any STD because one of the times we had sex I took you without condom"". And then I also told him that my last day in Cairo I met the most gorgeous man I've ever seen in my life and if I come again  will come for him and told him "" thank you for helping me choosing correctly,  it was a big relief""... Then blocked him . 

I think maybe my treatment was bad but I felt sad and ignored and then the way he replied to me that I only wanted him for sex, wasn't true. And he became cold to me out of the blue . Should I unblock him and talk to him again, maybe apologize or I behaved correctly? Somehow I feel bad inside and really miss him and honestly I wanted to make this trip to meet him again but he broke my heart .

I wait your replies,  thank you !",If a man wants someone he wouldn‚Äôt let her leave if he loves her he will definitely not be cold with her and will reply to her shortly he is making you feel guilty so you could leave and not to bother him by the right way he used your emotions just don‚Äôt look back and try to be with a real man

Would this be considered a double standard?

How would you approach this?","I‚Äôm not sure I understand what exactly you mean by ‚Äúcover up‚Äù? Like, if my boyfriend expects me to wear a bikini and not go around topless - I have no problem with that because I‚Äôm not gonna go topless anyway so his opinion aligns with mine.

If he wanted me to wear a more conservative swimsuit like something not too revealing at the beach then he would have to learn that his opinion doesn‚Äôt matter there (considering we are not in a Muslim country where a tiny bikini would look out of place and would go against the norm).

But to be honest this is a completely unrealistic scenario for me. There is no way I would progress in my relationship with a guy to the point of calling him boyfriend if he was the kind of guy to police what I wear."

When I log back in I see he had messaged me and I apologized and explained and ask him out for coffee. The date goes pretty well and he asks me if I'm dating other people since he doesn't believe in multiple dating. I say I am going out on dates but nothing has stuck yet. Since then he pursues me for 2 weeks, setting up dates every other day, messaging in between etc. By now I kinda really really like this guy and I've stopped going out on other dates altogether. Then we have the talk and everything goes south. He doesn't seem as into this as I expected, and after acting distant for a few days mentions he's been seeing another girl that he likes and he wants to give that a fair chance and he didn't feel right not telling me about it. I'm devastated but I wish him luck and agree to casually hangout. 2 months later he texts me now to mention he wants to give us a chance if I still like him. I have refrained from asking him about the other girl because I just didn't want to know. Should I even engage him in this conversation? Or just say no. I can't help feeling like the 2nd choice here.","Honestly, if you enjoyed dating him, give him another chance. He hasn‚Äôt really done anything wrong. This is all a part of dating.

Long story short, I did confirm with her and she acknowledged that she would be unwilling to meet with guys under 5 ft 10.

dating,146h0e7,2023-06-11 01:30:10,Who's lonely? This guy üòé,"Gonna just keep this short and simple for the same of all of us here. Also, don't expect much structure to this post either. Typing off the top of my head here. 

I feel overwhelmingly lonely anytime I start thinking about relationships. I'm only 20 and I recently finished my first year of college classes.  I've been very close to being in an actual relationship twice in my life but it suddenly stopped both times right when it seemed like we were actually getting somewhere. I never got a good reason as to why things didn't work out in either situation. 

I'd love to try and meet new people but I feel like it could be a waste of time mainly because I don't feel like I'm anywhere near cut out to be in a relationship. Let's learn why üßö‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è:

-I currently live with my father and grandparents in a sad little attempt to save at least some money while taking classes. Financially, I'm grateful for my living situation. Aside from that, I don't really like it here all too much. I never have anyone over because this house isn't exactly up to par with my standards that I had from my previous house. Makes me sound like a prick but it's true and it's something that I struggle with. 
-My hobbies are that of your typical 20 year old guy. I play video games, card games, I workout semi regularly, and I really enjoy my car. That's about it. I work 20-30 hours a week. I don't party or do any other social activities that would promote meeting new people. I hang out with some of my friends from high school when I can but we don't really go out to do things. We typically just pick someone's house and chill there for the evening. I just don't do interesting things. I bored the last girl I was talking to beyond belief. 
-I feel like I'm extremely emotionally unavailable. Physical touch and any sort of intimacy weirds me out for reasons that don't matter all too much for this post (thx mom). In my previous encounters, I was always ridiculously hesitant to ""make a move"" because I legit just don't know what it right and when to do it. In other words, I have zero game when I'm attracted to someone. Don't get me wrong though. I 100% crave even just the most basic forms of human touch. I get a hug from one of my gal friends every couple months but that's it. Nothing more. 

I could complain more about why I think attempting to rope literally anyone into trying to start a relationship with me, but I think you get the point. I'll go over some of my pros real quick I guess? 

-I'm fairly attractive according to all of my friends. I agree mostly agree with them so there's that. Love some confidence right? üíÄ
-I'm not a complete buffoon in terms of intellect. I'm not a genius by any means but I'm fully aware that I do and think about things differently than the general public. I feel like this is one of the big reasons I'm struggling with all of this so much. 
-I genuinely feel like I'm a pretty decent guy all around. I don't feel like I have any craaazy red flags aside from what has already been stated. 

That's it I guess. This was supposed to be short but oh well. Advice would be cool but I know what the general answers will be. Just posting this hoping that someone might say something that I haven't heard before. Just some general support would be cool. If you made it this far, thanks for reading.",

I went to a party yesterday, met with friends and made new friends. Around 4 AM most people were long gone but the 6 remaining of us (4 M, 2 F) then went to someone else's place to hang out. I was tired so I initially thought I'd go for a few minutes but ended up staying for over 5 hours.   
We were initially all a bit tipsy and my group of friends started taking ecstasy. I never tried but drugs are not really my thing so I didn't take any. We didn't consume alcohol during that ""after party"".   
We talked for hours about pretty much anything and everything. We eventually talked about what we thought about each others, the positive and the negative.   
I come from a small and rather isolated island with a population of less than 300k, it's a mainly conservative place, I moved to Canada over 12 years ago. I came to realize I have never had this kind of conversations with anyone before, either with friends in my home country or in my new country of residence.

What these people told me tore me apart, in a good way. I'm crying just writing these words.   
Some of them I've known for years, some for a few months, some I just met that night. The take aways are I'm a great guy, I lighten any place or group of people I come in contact with, I'm smart, interesting, funny, I have deep and meaningful conversations. One of them told me he wishes to become more like me. On the downsides, which I'm already more than aware of, I'm shy, I'm too modest, I need to open up faster (I do open up but it usually takes time for me to know the people and feel safe with them before I do). One of the 2 women present at that time told the other, her best friend, that it's me she should be dating. I find it flattering that the same woman, whom by her own account dislikes most men and can hardly engage in conversations with most of them told me she liked and even wants to take me on a ""date"" (my own word, she wants to have a drink with me someday). Note that she's a lesbian and currently in a relationship so it'll be nothing more than a friendly ""date"".

By their own account, the drugs they took were very light and they barely had a feel-good mood. The ones I've known for a long time did not display an altered behavior so I tend to believe this. For the people I knew from before, some of the things they told me, they already told me while sober so the drugs clearly did not alter their minds too much.

The things they told me affected me tremendously because I've felt like a human piece of crap, unworthy of romantic love for most of my life. I'm a 38 years old virgin (that, only 2 of my closest friends back home know about, and now you do as well) and I've been dealing with below 0 self-esteem and confidence all my life. I gave up any hopes of meeting someone a long time ago and haven't even tried looking for someome since then.   
I'm now working on this with the help of a therapist as well as working on my body and losing weight. -35 lbs in a couple months, I'm quite happy. I'm not calling for comments about weight loss, I know this is hardly sustainable in the long run and I'm taking precautions to protect my health, I'm simply starting from a very high weight and the initial loss is naturally much faster than for someone starting from a lower weight.   
My therapist tries to help me accept my body as it is (while still working on improving it of course) but that's something I simply cannot do. Years of suffering due to obesity have deeply ingrained a feeling of hate and disgust about my own body. I feel it will take more time to accept my body with her hello than losing my extra weight and getting to a body I'll be comfortable in.

I still have a hard time processing and accepting what they told me.   
A recent rejection, or at least I took it as a rejection, from a woman who initially pursued me and for whom I still have a high interest, makes it even harder for me to accept their compliments. How can they see these things in me when I can't and women seemingly don't either, or at least, the ones I have a romantic interest for?   
I still don't know what to do and think about this recent ""rejection"" (I have another comment describing what happened in more details but after pursuing me and initiating a date and physical contact, she slowly broke off contact with me and told me she wasn't ready for a relationship after I told her what I felt for her: an interest in knowing her more, and that I wanted to see her again). I know I should just accept it and let it go but as the first woman ever to show that much interest for me, I have a very hard time doing just that.   
I'm certainly very immature in many ways, especially when it comes to human interactions and dating/romance. I'm working on that. That after party is typically the kind of thing I would have never went to before and I had to force myself to do so, I'm happy and proud I did.

So, I'm still a work in progress, I need to learn to love myself without first putting a condition on my looks and weight.

Thanks for reading and I hope you can gain some insight from my experience.",Amazing post man! It‚Äôs great to hear good things about yourself (while you‚Äôre alive and not at your funeral). Keep up the self care. üíïüôè
dating,146go9o,2023-06-11 01:13:35,Why a lot of men have changed in regards to dating...,"I see a lot of posts in all the dating subs from women, complaining how all men are there just for hookups. Well this is why a lot of men on apps aren't looking for relationships. We literally can't win and most of us are simply tired of looking for a relationship.

&#x200B;

If I offer to pay, toxic masculinity.  
  
Don't offer to pay? Not a gentleman.  
  
Express interest in sex (at all, like even mention that I acknowledge the existence of sex) he's a player, all he wants is sex.  
  
Completely avoid the topic of sex, he's a prude, dead bedroom inbound  
  
Engage in touch at all (I like touching and physical closeness) creep, only wants sex  
  
Don't touch at all, cold, distant, prude  
  
Expressing emotions? You're unstable, you need therapy (because not strong)  
  
Concealing emotions? You're unstable, you need therapy (because emotionally unavailable)  
  
Expressing enthusiasm for hanging out and planning shared activity? Clingy  
  
Staying reserved and following her pace? Disinterested, unavailable  
  
Texts every day? Too available, too needy  
  
Texts every other day? Must not be too serious about this  
  
Responds immediately to messages- do you even have a life?  
  
Doesn't respond within 10 minutes of receiving messages- ""I feel like I don't matter to you""  
  
Dating is a big fucking joke in 2023. Nobody knows what they want, and we're all conditioned to just lie to each other constantly, trying to get the other to think we're perfect so we can get them invested in hopes that they'll just submit to the sunk cost and accept our flaws.","This post is exactly how I feel to a tee. 

Trying to court women nowadays can be a minefield. The slightest misstep and you're done."
dating,146go5s,2023-06-11 01:13:25,A lot of women would be fine with being friends with benefits if you guys were actually our friends,"I find myself in some situations, one in particular that recently, we went on a couple dates. We slept together then he says him he doesn‚Äôt want a gf. Whatever, he realized i wasn‚Äôt the one for him we both understood. We still talked to each other and hung out a few but it was like once a month. I ask him to do some things during the day and he declines. I get not wanting to see the little mermaid lol whatever.. sometimes i do find myself slightly resentful because while i do enjoy the benefits for the most part, we are not what i would consider friends.  And we only chill at night, at someone‚Äôs place.  It does bother me a bit because there‚Äôs benefit but not really friends.

If guys we‚Äôre actually friends with women.. It would be much more likely that women would sleep with you, instead of just doing the absolutely bare minimum and expecting it. Why not actually be friends with your fwb?",thats why i dont consider that fwb. you are each others booty call lmao.
dating,146ghm6,2023-06-11 01:04:39,I [33F] have over 10K likes on Tinder and hundreds of unread messages. How do ya'll handle this?,"There are so many men to talk to, and I don't know what to do. How do yall filter out which men to talk to?

I've looked at some other forums and apparently lots of women don't talk to guys under 6ft tall right? I figure I'll have to start doing that, but even after that I imagine I'll still have a few hundred likes that I need to sort from. Not to mention that I don't even swipe anymore because I am overwhelmed. 

I figure I might as well get rid of average - salary guys too? Maybe that will help lower the amount of men to sift through? 

Ugh, dating is such a pain. If only there was an easier way to sort through these men. 

I decided to plan out 1 date every day for a week, but even then that's only like 30 guys a month ü•∂ü•∂

That doesn't even come close to all the guys I can pick from.

What's a girl supposed to do?!?!","Anybody reading this and thinking it‚Äôs real and wasn‚Äôt crafted to be controversial should take a step away from the internet for a while. Transparent as hell, weirdo"
dating,146g3an,2023-06-11 00:45:29,the guy that i‚Äôm talking to is telling me different things than what his friends are telling me. help,"i‚Äôve had a little crush on since he started at my job. and we started hanging out and it felt great. we get along really well. i even had that conversation with him about intentions so i knew what he was looking for. he said he didn‚Äôt wanna jump into something too fast. which is so valid bc neither do i. so i was happy that he wanted to kinda be slow with things. 
moving forward, everything was going well. exactly how anyone would want it to go. he says the great things and he makes plans and he wants to continue making more. but that‚Äôs all by what he says. if we go by our mutual friends‚Ä¶they have something different to say. they say that i need to step back and be careful. they say that he doesn‚Äôt want anything serious‚Ä¶so a relationship. they say he‚Äôs not as into me as he acts. 
it just doesn‚Äôt sit well with me. it really doesn‚Äôt. i keep thinking of reasons why that might not be true. like, maybe he just hasn‚Äôt opened up to those friends about him having feelings for me. or maybe he‚Äôs simply just afraid to admit that he does have feelings for someone. 
it just doesn‚Äôt seem right. he even said he wanted to take a day trip to the beach with me. that doesn‚Äôt seem like something someone would do if they didn‚Äôt want a relationship? i‚Äôm just lost here. i don‚Äôt want to have to start putting my guard back up. bc when i do that, i go cold. i can‚Äôt be casual about it.",if his friends tell you what he is like - actually believe them.  You are romanticizing offering to go to beach.  Stop listening to the words and watch the actions.  I hope you haven't been intimate with a work mate for your own sake. Protect yourself from your heart being hurt.  Sex doesn't convince a guy to like/ love us or even want a relationship.  Can't trick a man into a caring relationship if he's been clear he's not interested.

dating,146fw4w,2023-06-11 00:36:13,Flaking on me.,"She(21) slept over last night but we didn't smash just made out and cuddled. I've(25M) known her for a week and took her on a date so it was her first time coming over.

She left my place saying she's going to a brunch with friends and really she did because I saw her stories. She sends me a voice note saying she'll call me when she's outside my place. Her friends in the background. That was 8pm. I cooked something up and got snacks... Back of my mind knowing she not likely to come through.

She didn't. I get a text at 12AM with crying emojis and her saying she just got home. 

It's disrespectful to me. 

It also makes me realize that I've been a bit too forward. She complained how I never text her unless it's to make plans to see her. So I'll just get back to doing that. 

I was low-key heated, but I'm calm now. It's really not a big deal. Either she really got caught up with her friends, or it was her toying with me to see how I'd react. Anyway, I replied with ""okay then.""

Edit: she was drinking with her friends. I get that. But there's literally no reason to tell me you're gonna come over when I'm literally content watching the Champions League final on a cool Saturday night.

I'm halfway out the door.","Agree. If you blew her off while hanging out with her friends, she‚Äôd probably be pissed. It‚Äôs about being considerate of someone else‚Äôs time."

dating,146fszz,2023-06-11 00:32:05,What a woman actually means when she says she likes confident men,"When a woman says she likes a confident man, what she really means is she likes an attractive man who *has* confidence. Physically attractive people are treated better by society and so naturally become more confident than unattractive people.

While confidence is attractive, it is generally only attractive to women if YOU are attractive physically. All the confidence in the world isn't going to make a woman tear her clothes off if you look like a frog about to be disected in Biology class.","As a woman, I disagree. A mediocre-looking but confident man who dresses and carries himself well is more attractive than an insecure, conventionally attractive guy.

Confidence is sexy. Insecurity is a huge turn off."

Lately when people ask about our status we have been referring to each other as bf/gf which is fine. But am I being high maintenance for wanting him to ask me to be his gf? I don‚Äôt even need a gift or anything. Am I being too extra or are my expectations too high?

For the past three years, I must have asked out some ten girls for dates. They range from women who I've been good friends for some time to acquaintances. Bar one (an acquaintance, curiously), all of them just left me hanging in there with half answers instead of just saying a clear no. It's not that I feel entitled to an answer, I just find it puzzling. They generally like the idea and say stuff like ""yeah, that would be fun!"", but when it's time to actually plan stuff, they'll either drop down the ""excitement"", cancel the plans on the same day or just straight up not answer.

Do they just don't care about me? Do they like the attention? Are they afraid of my reaction, given all the examples we have of men who lash out when things don't go their way?

My exboyfriend ended things out of the blue without full closure or a built up to the end, which was very confusing and painful. 

So, I I would advise you to sit down with your girlfriend and explain to her what life can be like for your, what you need from her, and that she would need to read up on your condition in order for this to work. If she is not interested in finding understanding and being the pillar during your tough times, she is not the one."

How to conquer this feeling which brings me down everytime I feel optimistic about dating.","You haven't worked on loving yourself fully, flaws and all. You're still depending on others to validate your value, when it should be your own beliefs about yourself that matters.

It's also likely that you have codependency issues, feeling the need to be with someone in order to be happy. That desperation can be sensed by people, which reveals how weak you are, and reflects in your body language.

Keep working on yourself, especially that negative self talk you do.

Know that no one is perfect and to just love you regardless of how much you make or whatever.

If you continue to rely on women to validate your worth, you're going to be severely disappointed.

Stop trying to impress them and impress yourself.

dating,146bjhu,2023-06-10 21:24:01,Levels of Cleanliness,"As many of us have realized, every relationship has a clean partner and a not as clean partner. 

Well, my gf is not a very clean person. Hell, I cannot sugar coat it, her house is absolutely filthy. It is getting so bad; I only bring myself to go over once a week.  I have her come over to my place as much as possible. But since she has pets at home, it is a rare occasion. 

She has 12 pets. 2 dogs, 2 cats and 8 birds. As well as having 2 kids, 13f & 10m, who refuse to help around the house.  I have tried to talk to them about helping their mom around the house and they both came back with ""it is not my job."" Now I do not think it is my place to tell her kids what to do in their house. But every time I go visit her place, I feel that I need clean. It is beyond a courtesy at this point.  

It is an extremely frustrating experience. Whenever I have her and her kids over, I make sure my place is presentable and clean. 

I hate eating there. There is animal hair is all over the place. If she hands me a utensil, dish, or cup, it is usually dirty. Everything use I have to wash. it has gotten to the point that when I get there cleaning her kitchen is usually my first task. Washing dishes, drying them, and putting them away. It always takes me a while because the sink is normally filled. 

Then I clean the floors. I do not take off my shoes, when I walk around her house. My feet turn black. If I wear socks, they get filled with animal hair. When I get home, I just toss my socks because there is no getting all the hair out of them. No matter how many times I wash them. Plus, the hair gets stuck on other clothes.  

I sweep and mop the kitchen, dining room, and living room. That usually helps with the smell of feces for most of the house. But then I have to empty the litter boxes to really get rid of the smell. I buy her scented candles and other air fresheners. But the lingering smell of poo is always there. 

And do not get me started on her laundry habits. It is sad and horrendous what she does to those loads.  I have not smelled a towel at her place that does not smell like it was left in the washer for a day or two before being dried. She is better with clothes. But folding them is another issue all together. 

She is a great person in all other aspects. She is extremely kind and giving and generous to where it is almost financially detrimental. If she were not so amazing, I would have left her long time ago.  

I have my own place. I work hard to maintain it and keep it up. But I know I will never want to live with her, unless things change. Because that will be my life for the foreseeable future.

Should I break it off now or stick it out because and cats and dogs do not live forever?","Man that's rough. Have you tried talking to her about it? She sounds like the type who'd be receptive to feedback.

As for the kids could you maybe suggest to her getting her kids to make their beds each morning? I used to have a somewhat messy room but then started making my bed and it kinda seemed to instill discipline into other areas of my life. It's a good starting point.

Cleanliness is a discipline. Messy house is often a reflection of a messy mind IMO."

Having cheated on people before I also know temptation is a fiery flame and doesn't limit itself to a single being ie. If it wasn't me it'd be someone else.

We went on a first date yesterday. It went REALLY WELL but there wasn't any physical contacts except when we were playing VR. We would occasionally push and hold onto each other to prevent falling. After the date, she texted me right away saying she had a great time and asked what I am doing over the summer, so I assumed she was interested and asked her out to watch a movie since we both love going to the theatres (she said yes). Should I ask her if she wants to hold hands, or just grab her hand during the movie? If I were to just grab her hand during the movie, how should I do it smoothly? If she rejects/pulls back her hand, how can I make it less awkward?

TLDR: Is it appropriate to hold my date‚Äôs hand for a second movie date? Is yes, how should I do it?","Just feel it out and do what feels most natural! But from a female‚Äôs perspective, I would definitely suggest taking it slow and smooth. I always appreciated it when my date would test the waters with a few hand brushes to gauge my consent. If she doesn‚Äôt bite by then, take that as she‚Äôs not ready. If that happens, don‚Äôt bring it up or overthink it! If she likes you, that won‚Äôt deter her from pursuing your attention in other ways. I hope that helps, good luck!"

dating,1469rfv,2023-06-10 20:08:39,"Is this normal for a date? Me F28, guy in question 34, almost 35 yo","Hi,

I (F28) am dating a guy (soon 35yo) and today was our 7th date. 

I told him I'm quite a romantic person and I would like him to come up with something to do for a date. 

We had a fight because in his opinion coffee dates are ok and guys don't have to pay for girls. In my opinion a guy needs to try a little bit. 
I earn enough to take myself out and get nice things / travel but would like a guy to try... At least a littl3 bit. 

On 5th date I organised a dinner for us and paid for both



Today was our 7th date and I travelled to see him in his city. He suggested going to a gallery. Apparently would always pass this gallery on his way to work but never actually went in. It was free and quite small and that's alright. Exhibition was quite poor as it was modern art and neither of us know anything about it lol


Anyhow. After that I said we can go for a walk. I thought we might go to a cafe or grab a bite somewhere. He started walking and asked if I'm hungru to which I replied yes. His response was :""ok, we can go to this shop on the way to my place. We can get something to eat and have some tea"" 

Thing is - we never discussed going to his place. He just assumed. We literally just went there (him leading me). He never asked if I wanted to come. Mind you I would've been cool with that but... Without even asking? Am I being paranoid? 


We watched a tv show. I ate a sandwich and had some tea and at some point he started kissing me. I like it and we made out for a while. He asked if I wanted to go to the bedroom, I nodded no, sort of smiled and pulled back a little. 

I tried cuddling /Hugging him after that but he got up, went to the loo and we didn't kiss/ hug anymore. 


I'm getting bad vibes but I might be over thinking this? 
The biggest problem for me is he only wanted to kiss when it would lead to sex (immediately) and didn't ask if I wanted to come to his place. We literally just wemt there lol


Tl;dr is this normal for the 7 the  date - a guy, M35 and me(F28) met at a gallery and he then took me straight to his place without asking if I wanted to come.
Kissing only seemed to lead to sex.
Is that normal or have I mot been dating for ages?",I think he sounds really cheap and I wouldn't really be happy seeing a guy. Like him. You have to trust your Gut instead if you feel uncomfortable with him and don't like the way hes acting. Then he's not for you. I definitely like a guy to spend a little more money on me and I would never have payed for him like you did
dating,1469r19,2023-06-10 20:08:09,Am I wrong to ask my BF to not discuss our relationship problems with his family?,"My (36M) BF and I (33F) had a discussion about moving forward in our relationship, which has always been rocky. It was going well until I told him that one of the requirements I have moving forward is that any issues we have with each other should be kept between us. I said that it just invites more strife and chaos when you add other people to the mix because everyone has their own opinion and if either of us feels validated by someone else's opinion it just further adds to the problem, especially if we had already come to an agreement and one of us brings it up to someone else and that person disagrees with what we agreed on. It opens up the potential for more arguments and disagreements. EX, we had come to an agreement about chores and how to best go about them. Yet he still complained to his mom about our agreement, and his mom said that what I had said was BS and that I was just being lazy. He then came home and accused me of being lazy and not doing enough (I do all of the chores by myself 99% of the time, except for laundry because i hate folding laundry so it sits in the basket for a few days) and since he worked outside of the home I shouldn't expect him to help out with chores because i'm home all day (Im a SAHM). When I talked to her about some  things that were bothering me before,  she told me that she didn't think he ever loved me, that he was only with me because of the kids, and that he had a shot at something great with his ex wife had he stayed on his meds, further adding onto insecurities I already had.
She'd basically plays both sides, and my boyfriend and I would fight about whoever  his mom agreed with was right and the other person was wrong. 
He couldn't agree to not talking to his family about our issues and said that I was trying to isolate him. 
He said that I had a therapist to talk to, saying that if he couldn't talk to his family about these things, who else was  he supposed to talk to. I told him to get a therapist. He said he didn't want a therapist. He wanted to talk to his family and that he would decide which issues he would and wouldn't talk about. I told him that I couldn't move forward then because it adds to the general distrust that we both have and that I didn't feel safe discussing anything with him because I can't be sure what he'll say to his family.
He said it wasn't fair that I had someone to talk to and that I wanted to isolate him. I told him that I wasn't isolating him, I was asking him to not talk to his family about our relationship issues, and that its different talking to a therapist because a therapist isn't going to talk shit about the other person, and they also won't talk to others about what was discussed.

In the end he said that he wasn't going to agree to my request, so I told him that that meant that there wouldn't be anymore discussions between us then because I didn't feel safe talking to him about anything going on because I don't know what he would and wouldn't tell other people.

Am I in the wrong here?",You‚Äôre not wrong. What goes on between y‚Äôall should stay between y‚Äôall. Not everyone wants their dirty laundry aired.

We met and were close to sleeping with each other, but we paused mid-way. Before I left I could tell he was upset, and I‚Äôm pretty sure it was because we stopped.

Later, I asked him how he felt about our situation and he told me that he didn‚Äôt know how to answer the question‚Ä¶.

I told him I was confused and thought that we shouldn‚Äôt continue if it was going to be like this, but wanted to hear his opinion‚Ä¶.

dating,1468h90,2023-06-10 19:13:54,Can't really date anyone when everyone annoys me,"Title

Not really looking for advice as I know I need to just go out more and socialize, but that in of itself is largely the issue and maybe someone here has good advice. 27 M if that means anything.

I've always been like this for as long as I can remember. Whether it's due to a life long history of being treated by shit by most people throughout school life and past that or something else I'm not super sure, but in general I find trying to socialize with most people to be a chore and I'd rather just not participate. 

I've had a few relationships in the past. Anything during high school never really lasted all that long (a week at most), and everything after high school has been long distance and doomed to fail (cheated on twice but should've seen that one coming). I've had largely minimal instances of women showing interest in me, and the few instances that it has happened I was either too drunk to make an actual call on anything or I'd rather not embarrass myself assuming they were into me when they weren't.

I wouldn't say I have issues approaching women in the dating sense but it's like, for me personally, why bother when it's unlikely we have anything in common and I would just end up losing interest. I really only came to this realization recently where I've noticed that outside of a few friends I have, most people I talk to are genuinely extremely boring or genuinely awful to converse with.

The few relationships I have had I did genuinely try my hardest with as those few women I did date I did have genuine interest in and we did gel with each other quite well but it just never worked out (usually because they were cheating but again guess I should've expected that given the relationships were long distance).

To be honest with this post I sort of expect to get flamed/roasted or whatever but I genuinely can't really vent about this to friends anymore as none of them care or just tell me to go out and socialize more.","It‚Äôs a tough crowd. I can relate. I‚Äôm a nerdy person who likes to read and talk abt philosophy, history, politics, science but also I wanna do outdoorsy things like hiking. 
It‚Äôs hard finding someone one who fits with my interests so I usually end up compromising. Even then it doesn‚Äôt work. So yeah it just feels like a waste of energy.

Why bother but then being in relationship is really nice so idk"
dating,1468cig,2023-06-10 19:08:17,What could make you (M) feel friendzoned?,"Or what could make you not start a move?

So, I (22F) have been told by my friends (M/F) and strangers that I am a beautiful girl, every now and then I get complimented on my style, pics on SM etc. so I really, really, don‚Äôt hope that my appearance is throwing people off.

I am a social butterfly, tend to get along with most people and make friends easily‚Ä¶
But, although I get complimented, I never had anyone of my guy friends flirt with me or anything like that. My guy friends call me ‚ÄúQueen‚Äù, when they see me, one of them told me I always look hot when he was drunk (he was in a relationship at the time but they just broke things of), they say I am the coolest person they know etc pp.
I only have one guy friend with whom I have this low-key flirty-banter relationship with but I thinks that just our friendship dynamic and nothing more. Also, I just moved countries..

I‚Äôve been told that ppl have felt intimidated bc they thought I looked ‚Äòtoo cool‚Äô and or been surprised when I i.e. approached/complimented them (back).

I know, y‚Äôall can‚Äôt see how I act in real life so the answers can only go so far, but I talked to one of my friends about it and she told me maybe I‚Äôm not ‚Äúmysterious‚Äù enough and that I need to disclose myself a little more maybe to make guys ‚Äúchase‚Äù me lol. I don‚Äôt wanna be ignorant cuz maybe there is some good advice but also, my inner ENFP-stubbornness is just saying heeeeeeeeelll, no. Why should I conform to random norms or ‚Äúgames‚Äù ppl have made up in order to attract someone who wouldn‚Äôt be attracted to me otherwise, you get me?

She did say sth else, like I thought maybe I‚Äôm friendzoning my guy friends and that‚Äôs the reason? I don‚Äôt know if it has anything to do with it but I did grow up with 5 brothers and maybe, I don‚Äôt know maybe I act too amicable? But what does this mean? What things could a girl do that would make you feel friendzoned? 

Cuz I don‚Äôt need a man or a relationship, but growing up and never having anyone like me in my life (or at least they didn‚Äôt tell me), to having my friends confess to each other and having guys and even our roommates telling them they like them to all of the girls I live with but me, I don‚Äôt know it makes me sometimes wonder why it never happened to me, you know?",I would guess you‚Äôre not giving signs that you are interested in a relationship. If you‚Äôre hanging out with friends and not indicating you want a relationship with someone they more then likely don‚Äôt want to waste the time or potential rejection

Some people think I have a masculine complex but I don‚Äôt see it. I do love men.,"You first decide if a relationship would even be possible. If there are deal breakers that exist and you know about them from the start, don't even bother dating the person.

If you decide to pursue a relationship, then you take the time to get to know them well before you allow yourself to get too deeply invested. Make sure you are taking time out from being infatuated to consider the situation rationally, and get advice from people who care about you and are wise enough to give good advice. 

Keep in mind that most relationships start off being wonderful. You're infatuated, flush with happy brain chemicals, and everyone is on best behavior. If you start seeing things you don't like after a few months, understand that those are ""the real him"" and most likely things you'll be dealing with for the long term. 

You really can't know in the beginning if someone is right for you, simply because you really don't know them as a partner until they've been a partner for a while. It's more of a hindsight thing. There are sign posts along the way that tell you you're headed in the right direction, and sometimes warning signs that tell you to look for the next available exit. But it will take a while before you can say with certainty that your belief that this person is right for you is correct."

(He being the graduate of my university) the dates went well and we started talking to each other for hours daily. It was about the time when i had to leave my city for the college again. He was very sad to see me go and wanted to see me for the last time that day but I couldn‚Äôt meet him due to family reasons. He ghosted me because he was angry and sad about it. I confronted him and we went back to being normal. Then he said he wants me to meet his parents before he leaves india(he is planning of settling abroad so wanted to introduce me to the family) we were just getting to know each other only. It‚Äôs been 2-3 days and we didn‚Äôt even know anything about each other but he got sure about me being the one for him. Then he mentioned on 3rd day that he wants unprotected intercourse and wasn‚Äôt ready to listen to me i am so against this but we fought over this. Knowing how risky this is. Then he started commenting on my looks and what all he wants to change in my appearance jokingly. Which I didn‚Äôt like as i felt i never wanted to change anything in his looks then why does he want that from me(me being way superior to him in looks). Then days passed by we were getting closer to each other and he mentioned about his previous sexual experiences which I didn‚Äôt like at all as those people were my known. He laughed the situation and said sorry and it went back to normal. I forgave him. Then on the 10th day he got angry on me for deleting my comment on his picture because of personal reasons which were way too valid and he told me to separate
 our paths and how this thing won‚Äôt work between us (mind you he is saying i love you to me since the starting) he said a lot of things like i am so done with you you need to leave even when i was trying to calm him down then i just gave up and said bye. After some time he started calling and texting me like crazy apologising and gaslighting me into not stopping him from going away even when i tried like anything. I never wanted a person who wont be scared to lose me when he is angry and can‚Äôt have a communication. He even removed me from his socials when he was angry. 
Can someone let me know if i did the right thing leaving him and properly communicating to him as to why I didn‚Äôt want a man like that?",It sounds like you did the right thing.

dating,1465wnu,2023-06-10 17:25:47,"Just give me a straight up answer, don‚Äôt sugar coat it.","What‚Äôs up with this dude? 

I (22) met a guy (21) over a month ago at a college bar. He was staring at me all night, but never approached me so finally when he just stayed lingering around me all night, I finally said something to break the ice. He sat with me all night, but didn‚Äôt say much, but also wouldn‚Äôt leave my side. I took it as he wasn‚Äôt interested so I didn‚Äôt bother asking for his number or anything and left that night in the dust. 

The next morning, his friend snapchats my girl friend I was out with and says his buddy, the one I met, really wanted my number. I gave it to him through his friend which was weird, but I figured maybe he‚Äôs shy so I found it kinda cute. He texts me a couple hours later and we text for a week and the conversation was pretty dry and he took a long time to reply. So I stopped texting, figured he wasn‚Äôt interested or was stringing me along. 

A couple days later, after i stoped texting him, he asked if I wanted to go get ice cream and ‚Äúhangout‚Äù at like 10:00 PM. I wasn‚Äôt sure if that meant hooking up, which I‚Äôm not interested in, but I agreed anyway and the date itself was fine. We cuddled a little and watched TV and talked and that was it. Super innocent.

I texted him after the date, saying thanks for paying and yadda yadda, and he continued the conversation. Like before, still pretty dry and we would take hours to respond, but he kept it going.

Fast forward to a couple weeks ago, he texted me saying hes home for summer break and I joked and said ‚Äúok see you never ig‚Äù and he said he‚Äôd see me again when he‚Äôs back. But he sorta left me on read after and he‚Äôs not back till August. We haven‚Äôt texted since and I doubt we‚Äôll text again.

Is this dude playing me, is he immature, shy, or am I reading too much into this? Maybe he‚Äôs just not into texting, but to me, that shows a level of disinterest. How can he swoop back in August when we‚Äôre not gonna text all summer? Or am I delusional for thinking he‚Äôll actually hit me up again? I‚Äôm just confused.

Hope this all makes sense, any advice or insight would be greatly appreciated!üòÖ","He definitely likes you, more than he normally does, I am guessing. He lacks confidence. He doesn‚Äôt know how to proceed. He doesn‚Äôt know how to make this situation into something more.

He was like ‚Äúyou look like you‚Äôre going out‚Äù even though I literally look the same as I do any other day at work. He is always messing around with me and he gives me shoulder massages without me asking. He‚Äôs pretty touchy. The other day we were playing hangman and things got pretty sexual. The word was ‚Äúdirty‚Äù and he was like oh you wanna do dirty things huh, Where when and how?‚Äù I have a pretty hot pic of me as my wallpaper on my phone and he‚Äôll try and open my phone to look at it .

He‚Äôll touch my dress. He‚Äôll bump into me at work at the host stand. It‚Äôs clear there‚Äôs tension with us but we are co workers and I‚Äôve never really dealt with this before.

Anyways last night we were hanging out and he ended up starting the conversation about not being ready for a relationship. I‚Äôll just list out his key points he made: 

-he thinks I‚Äôm wonderful, it‚Äôs not like he is sitting at home being like if OP was XYZ I would want a relationship. He said if he were ready he would want one with me.
-he didn‚Äôt think it was fair to ask me to wait and not see other guys while he figures out his own stuff. I told him I had been going on other dates and he was glad to hear it but then was like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt really want to know about those dates. I‚Äôm just glad your not waiting‚Äù
-he still wants to go on dates and talk on the phone. He really doesn‚Äôt want to lose my friendship he said. 
-if I do end up in a relationship, he still really wants to be my friend and be able to call and talk to me because I‚Äôm one of his best friends
-he finds me insanely attractive

I‚Äôm sorta unsure how to feel, like it definitely seems like it doesn‚Äôt have anything to do with me, but then my little insecure voice is like ‚Äúnope, he just doesn‚Äôt like you. it‚Äôs a you thing‚Äù 

I do really appreciate his maturity in bring it up, but I‚Äôm kinda bummed too because I do really like him. He is a great guy.","I don't think he sounds like a great guy.

dating,1464ncv,2023-06-10 16:33:18,Everyone is innately selfish....,"..so dating is essentially a circus/balancing act of finding someone who can satisfy your selfish desires and vice versa. 

At least that's what it feels like when you're someone who wants to give love and just simply be appreciated for a giving nature and not be taken advantage of. It's a very hard balancing act of not giving too much in the early stages of dating or exposing yourself as a giver to be taken advantage of while also, just being yourself. I'm learning how to navigate better and be smarter about how I move in the dating world BUT man, this is mentally exhausting. üòÆ‚Äçüí®","I wouldn't say ""selfish"" but you're close to what ppl don't seem to grasp. At the end of the day, the person has to also want you as well. Too many folks walk around thinking ppl of the gender they're attracted to should want to date them just because they put in effort.

We have a weird dynamic where I hooked up with him when I was a teenager but in adulthood I friend zoned him and watched him roll around town.

dating,1462smj,2023-06-10 15:15:14,Need help in understand my feelings and the situation,"
I (25F) was in a casual relationship with (29M), from beginning we were very clear about keeping casual things between us as we both weren‚Äôt each other‚Äôs type but we were attracted with each other and seemed nice to each other (more like friends) we also decided to be transparent about our feelings and if we are seeing someone or going on dates with each other. Things were great for 8-9 months until now. We used to meet couple of times in a week and I also went on few dates separately in the mean time but I never liked any of those guys so it ended up just one date with them whereas he didn‚Äôt go on any days with someone as according to him he is busy and doesn‚Äôt have much time on spare.
 But I went on more date where me and my date (let‚Äôs name him James) really hated off and I wanted to see how that goes so I asked him to stop for now as I really wanted to see where it goes with James, but unfortunately James had his own issues so after couple of dates he stopped.
So I again started talking to my casual but few times I felt he is getting jealous when the topic came up about me and James. Two months passed and one day out of nowhere he came and said let‚Äôs not continue and meet for one last time. When I asked him what happened he said things are getting intense (I still have no clue what exactly it means). I met him the next day and none of us really spoke about it and we stopped talking for next 2 weeks. (Not going to lie that time I felt like knife getting stabbed in my guts). 
But after 2 weeks he messaged me and trying to have conversation in the morning and wanted to meet me on the same day, but as I was busy I agreed on meeting him the next day. But later the evening he was very drunk and called me and we spoke for an hour and a half where he said he stopped because he was getting very attached with me and even if we decide to move forward with this we wouldn‚Äôt be able to work out as we are poles different to each other. I met him the next day and the same we didn‚Äôt talk anything about it as he wanted to sleep. I assumed he remembered our conversation and is trying to avoid it.
In the following week we were messaging and he said he is going and I am usually used to making fun of him with his age and he is not married so I asked him where are you going and that if he is getting married to which he replied yes in 3 days(of course he was messing around about the marriage) but at this point I was having mixed feelings, so I decided to confront him that if he remembers anything about what he said to me and he said yes but he also said let‚Äôs not continue. I said ok but I didn‚Äôt wanted to stop seeing him and was having mixed feelings about the entire situation as in my mind it was clear he likes me and I wasn‚Äôt sure what I feel like.
After 2-3 weeks I was in stress with my university and I was missing him as well and due to the stress I couldn‚Äôt hold back my emotions  and he is the best place for me to vent too so I messaged him. We were messaging and that time he told me he lied about the night he was drunk actually he doesn‚Äôt have any memories as he was very drunk. At this point I started feeling my anxiety has reduced a little which was there from last 2 weeks. But he also told me he is seeing someone and if everything works out well things can get serious. I again started having mixed feelings and I felt a little jealous somewhere. After that we just met once and we haven‚Äôt talked since. And I am now convinced that now he is seeing someone he won‚Äôt message me.
I need help to understand what happened that lead to all this to get a closure and what are my feelings towards him as I really feel he is my safe spot to vent and I miss him too but have to hold myself because in theory it‚Äôs over. Or am I just attached to him and it is a matter of time and I will be ok? Or is it just about me feeling him as a space spot to vent?",Maybe it can be that when you were going on dates with James he was very jealous and maybe he was hurt somewhere because people tend to catch feelings or get attached in this casual relationships. Maybe that hurt or jealousy led him to do this? It can also be that since he said things were getting intense and maybe he didn‚Äôt get the same energy from you that‚Äôs why he wants move on and get with someone he can be distracted with. But all that being said it doesn‚Äôt justify how he behaved in the end because you need closure of what happened and all of a sudden he is seeing someone that he can get serious with whereas you had been in this casual relationship for 8/9 months and he didn‚Äôt think to take a chance? Also about the fact that you are pole opposites..this doesn‚Äôt matter if you hit it off with someone. Sometimes polar opposites workout just as fine as people with a lot similarities and vice versa.

But when I told this to my friend, she started groaning and said ""Well now almost no guy will want you.""

That's sounds a little dramatic to me, but I'm curious what the internet thinks. I've run into a little bit of dating trouble since pursuing my masters, and have found some guys to be intimidated, though I dont understand why. I really dont care if I date a guy with more or fewer degrees than me, so long as we have similar levels of intelligence. Some of the smartest people I know only have a high school diploma, so I really dont care about comparing sheets of paper.

Is this really an issue for guys?

I (22F) work in a salon and I am required to wear makeup every day for work.

Because of this, most of the pictures I have of myself are with makeup on. 

I've been talking to a guy (28) who lives about 2 hours away. We've talked every day for about a month, and met up and gone on dates twice now, which of course I wore makeup on.

The first situation was spur of the moment and when I was around 17 years old the 34 year old asked me for money to help pay a bill and after I helped her we had sex almost as a reward I didn't speak to her again after that.I thought that this was how men are supposed to keep girls around so this time I got myself into a situation where I wanted to meet a girl as I took a liking to her so I gave her some money to spend when she came to my city we did meet and have sex but immediately after she blocked me on everything. Its only now that I have been blocked that I recognise the relationships that I am having with these women is the exact same as paying for sex as the women didn't like me for me but what I could provide how do I move away from these types of relationships and when entering relationships in the future how do I tell them about me basically paying for sex in the past?,34f with 17m.

I've tried sending voice messages and pictures to make my conversations more engaging but it doesn't seem like it's working. 

Multiple women have also told me they think I am not that interested in them. It makes me wonder what other guys are doing. Should I be calling more instead of texting? Maybe it would prioritize me in their life more?

I am just trying to figure out how to compete! Thanks!","I have a personal policy of asking twice tops. If I get a ""no"" the second time I stop talking to them. A woman that's interested will usually make things easier for you. If she's coming up with all these excuses for why she can't meet you and she doesn't propose an alternative date, she's probably not interested. Could also be that she's just scared or unsure, but the reason doesn't matter. It's a waste of time and you're better off moving on"

dating,1461d2e,2023-06-10 14:14:26,I got ghosted - should I move on or try and talk to her again?,"She 30F had a crush on me 26M and then ghosted me?


It all starts with a mutual friend of hours who happens to work at the same company as me. Me and him aren‚Äôt super close, but we‚Äôre what you‚Äôd call great work friends. He‚Äôs my favorite coworker, I see him on the way to work as he lives a bit closer so we usually meet up and walk the final leg. A coffee buddy, but not necessarily a go out party buddy or anything like that. He‚Äôs a few years my senior and has kids and a wife putting him in a completely different stage in life. 

Anyway, the story goes that he mentioned someone who lives in my building I think he went to college with, but I get the impression it was more so a friend of his wives who also went to the same school. I had never paid attention to this girl, but seen her a few times around the high rise. You know like when you see a person and you‚Äôd recognize them, but wouldn‚Äôt do anything beyond that. I don‚Äôt recall if I ever even said hello. Again it‚Äôs one of those things, IDK why, but some people I say hello to right when I get on the elevator others I don‚Äôt. 

He mentions her and how she said ‚Äúwho‚Äôs that guy he‚Äôs so handsome‚Äù and said she‚Äôs been crushing on me or a secret admirer I guess you‚Äôd call it. He first told me this at the end of April. 

Well, finally I met her bumping into her I introduced myself we chatted for a couple mins and that was that. Again, a few days later I ran into her in the package room we rode the elevator up and just said hello. Not too much at all. 

I felt like after the first interaction things were good, I think she knew I‚Äôd heard obviously what my friend had said but wasn‚Äôt awkward at all. We just smiled she said her name etc. 

Next thing you know, she‚Äôs popping up everywhere on Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, so a couple days after I see this I shoot her a follow request on Instagram.  I check back the next day, still on requested. Then, the following day I go back and it says follow.  WTF? Did I just get ghosted? 

Also, I shot her a funny message on our housing portal app it‚Äôs like a community app where we submit vendor tickets, pay bills, and it has everyone‚Äôs contact in there where you can DM. 

I sent one on there. A week later I‚Äôm sitting on ghosted 2x. 

Eventually I‚Äôll have to see her again simply by chance, but I‚Äôm absolutely going to take a backseat role here ‚Äî right? My friend absolutely wouldn‚Äôt send me off, but we aren‚Äôt so close that I‚Äôd bother him over this. And based on the girls friendliness etc when we first introduced, she definitely seemed interested. 

FWIW, I know she‚Äôs really close with this other girl I am friendly with who‚Äôs married. Me and this girl and sometimes her husband all keep the same schedule and she‚Äôs super friendly almost like she‚Äôs interested for her friend, if that makes sense. I haven‚Äôt seen her recently to notice any change in her attitude but will definitely be watching for it. I don‚Äôt even know her name, but we chat a lot when we run into each other. 

What do my next steps look like? It seems obvious if she was super into me she would‚Äôve at least replied to my message? Maybe too soon for IG, but IDK the whole thing seems off‚Ä¶ 

Honestly it won‚Äôt be awkward for me, but I feel bad if I did something that turned her away. I‚Äôm fine with just being neighbors at a distance.","Whatever her reasoning was, the question you have to ask yourself is do you really want to be with someone who doesn't know how to communicate and will most likely run away from problems when they arise ?
Because that's exactly what ghosting is along with a lack of consideration and respect for the other party involved."

dating,14619op,2023-06-10 14:10:29,I (35F) was just let down by a guy (35M) who said he had given up on dating. One my best friends (37M) said he gave up too. How common is that?,"Maybe I'm coming in after the war happened, but this is a new one to me.

  
I met said guy through a mutual acquaintance, we shared similar interests so I got his number and messaged him from time to time. We went to a convention together and also ate a few times together. Not official dates, just talking about stuff and life. I thought there was a good connection, and he's the discreet sort, so I went forward and asked him out ""officially"". He was dumfounded, which was fun at first. Then he shook his head. We talked a bit more about it, apparently he had never been asked out and never had a girlfriend before. And at this point, he was done trying. 

  
We still meet up every now and then, sometimes the topic comes up. I thought that if it doesn't click well with me, at least I hope he keeps an open mind for other people. He replied that he does click with me, but he thinks that ship has sailed for him.

  
I discussed that with some friends. Turns out, another dude I know is in a similar situation, no girlfriend, no sex ever. It's even weirder in his case, as he apparently had someone that was head over heels into him not too long ago, and she didn't mind his lack of experience. He himself said she was great and it gave him fuzzy feelings, but all the same he let her down gently. He told me someone was into him, at least once in his life, and that's victory enough for him.

  
It's still novel to me. So I'd like to know, have you had similar experiences in your social circles?","We're tired.  It's a huge rat race that revolves around a lot of competition and I just don't have it in me anymore. 

Found someone I thought I could really fall for, hah, she was still quietly hoping her ex would come back.

dating,1460pzq,2023-06-10 13:47:14,Am I being shallow ?,"I (26F) joined a dating app not too long ago and I started talking to this guy who on paper sounded like a perfect match for me. We met up for a first date this week but when I saw him and although I recognised him, I thought he looked different from his pictures. First of all he was much larger than he appeared on the app but even his face, vibe and style was so different from his pictures. On the app he looked well put together whereas in person he was dressed like he just grabbed whatever was available in his closet at the time.
I quickly brushed that aside and we ended up having a nice time, the discussion flowed fairly easily and we have a lot in common but in spite of it I still could not feel any romantic spark. 
I told him (with as much empathy as possible) that I was not interested in a second date.
Now I'm wondering if I'm just being shallow for refusing to pursue a relationship with someone just because I'm not into them physically ? Should I have pushed past my initial feeling ?","I don't think this qualifies as shallow. If there is something that throws you off just go with it. If you're not into them you're not into them. While it being a purely physical thing isn't necessarily good, if that's what it is be honest with yourself and look for what you want."

Does he like me or he‚Äôs just not interested enough? Is there something I should be doing or not doing? Should I just move on?","He doesn‚Äôt seem interested enough, sorry. And to me, it seems evident from the lack of communication that happens when he is physically away from you."

She constantly sends me a picture that she's eating somewhere and teasing me that it might be some guy just to annoy me. In a dark humour way. In reality, she's with her parents.

It seems I'm unlovable, everyone gets bored with me after several months and nobody has any feelings towards me. There were friends that wanted to date me, but after months in friendzone I couldn't look at them this way.

My biggest dream since I remember was to be a wife and a mom. I don't believe I could be happy without a family. I am on dating apps for 3 years. I met 40 guys, dated 7, but nobody has developed any feelings towards me.

It's very rare to me to be attracted to someone, so when I feel attraction I get attached very fast and I don't want to give up even if someone treats me bad and shows they don't love me. Most guys that I met told me they want a family and treat me seriously, but after some time they lose interest. I tried different methods and nothing works. If someone tells me they want children, I just start imagining our life together. When they step back, I panic and do everything to keep them. I don't learn anything.

Most people tell me to be patient, but I hate being single. I want to cuddle, I want to have sex, I want someone to go out together. Also I want to have children and don't want to wait till 40.

Since my last break up I'm very depressed. I feel better when I meet someone and then when it doesn't work I'm depressed again. I'm addicted to dating apps and texting with someone. I know it's not healthy and probably guys can sense that I'm desperate. I was on therapy, but it didn't help me at all, it made me even more depressed knowing how my childhood and lack of love destroyed me.

Any advice? Did someone overcome it?",Try the route people tell men - work on yourself.

We split up, but then he reached out a few months later and we started talking again but decided to figure out the details during a visit. I went to go see him and was very excited. When I got there, however, I was surprised to see that he was acting pretty aloof with me. He told me how happy he was in his new life, how he couldnt imagine living anywhere else, and didn‚Äôt understand why people didn‚Äôt live in his new town. He also criticized me for calling his new town by an old nickname, pointed out someone he had made out with during our break and said she was needy, and joked about how many people he could hypothetically get with in his new town. 

It all made me feel like an outsider or awkward interloper who didn‚Äôt belong. I told him I was happy for him, but also that his over the top happiness made me wonder whether he was trying to send me a message: either that he was over me, or he wanted to start dating, or something. 

He shut down and got really upset. He said that he was just acting normal, and that if there was any weirdness, then it must be something about me that was causing that. He got upset that I would criticize him for his happiness, and project my own insecurities of our relationship onto him unfairly. I told him that I guessed I misread things. 

We haven‚Äôt talked about it again, except when he told me he talked to his friends and told me they said he was not overly happy and so again I must be the one unfairly projecting my feelings. What do I do? Leave? Talk about it again?

Tldr: ldr crush/situationship invited me to see him then acted distant and happy without me","Personally? I think him randomly pointing out a girl he made out with to you is a big red flag. 

Now I don‚Äôt know his perspective of events, but assuming things happened exactly how you described, it does read as though his behavior is at least strange. And even if he was being ‚Äònormal‚Äô, I feel as though you bringing up your concern shouldn‚Äôt have made him shut down or really upset. 

A friend of mine dated a guy who displayed some of these traits so I might be a little biased here, but I really believe that everyone deserves someone who very obviously wants them around. 

Now since it seems like you‚Äôre actively on this trip, I would say still try to feel things out. See if his attitude changes, if he become more welcoming.

Pam ( we‚Äôll call my gf Pam) was always all over me. Not only was Pam affectionate towards me with the normal ( hugs, kissing, etc) but sex. I remember some days I would be trying to sleep and she would start trying to have sex with me. It was like 5+ times a week. I‚Äôve never has someone that into me. Of course no matter how tired I was I‚Äôd always go with it.

Now 4 to 5 months have passed things got less and less. Which I just was like yep the honeymoon phase is over. 5+ times a week became, 1 to 2 a week. Which I cool with, cause she was wearing me out üòÖ. The the kissing would slow down also which I noticed it, but never took it into consideration. 

6 to 7 months in love making becomes 1 or 2 a month, kissing becomes 1 to 2 a week. Affection becomes less and less.

While all this is happening. I‚Äôm still doing everything for her, making sure all of her needs are met and then some. Buying and building custom/ random gift baskets for her. Her favorite candy, wine, face masks, bath items. Literally $100+ gift baskets. Cause I knew she was going through some hard time with work and other personal stuff going on in her like. Also I should mention she has a 3 year old son. Which was something I didn‚Äôt want to get into when we first started talking, but I genuinely like this girl and told myself this would be worth it. First off  Sam‚Äôs (we‚Äôll call him Sam) dad is a pos! Like major POS! 
I had a terrible childhood growing up. I don‚Äôt have a father or mother. So I know it‚Äôs hard (well I do have them adopted parents, but they treated us so bad. I can talk about that in another post if you want to hear it) So for me I always said if I had a kid I‚Äôd treat him better that anything in this world, for Sam that‚Äôs what I want. I know I‚Äôm not his dad but I want him to feel loved. Even if his real father doesn‚Äôt do anything for him.

But back to it. So now we‚Äôve hit a year in and any sort of affection has drop tremendously. I still show her in other was since sex and kissing happens once in a blue moon. Always asking if she needs anything. Just to make sure she knows im still here for her and my affection hasn‚Äôt gone anywhere.
 But it‚Äôs all one sided. And im torn on what to do. Yes, we‚Äôve talked about it. Normally every two months I get tired of not receiving any sort of affection or attention. We talk about it, she always tells me it‚Äôs her and she has no want for sex or kissing. Then she tells me that I should ask if I want something. I hate having to ask for a kiss let alone sex. I feel like I shouldn‚Äôt have to ask. But I never ask, I just try and do things to turn her on, but get no physical emotion from her. Or she flat out tells me no.

So now at the beginning of this year. I‚Äôve pretty stop trying at all and just leave it to her when she wants any sort of affection that way. And I‚Äôve gotten to the point where sex is irrelevant, but I would rather have a kiss then sex.

Valentines comes around and we get a nice Airbnb in Austin and I go all out with her gifts and just an all around good experience for her. I spent probably close to $1500 on her. To show that she means the world to me. All I was hoping a kiss to be honest. I got nothing. Besides a cookbook‚Ä¶ at this point I‚Äôve lost all hope of any sort of connection/ affection. 

I know a lot of y‚Äôall are going to say I should leave her and move on, but I love her dearly and the connection with Sam is hard for me to want to leave. I will be honest and say it has crossed my minds more time than I‚Äôd like to admit these past few weeks, but I‚Äôm in between jobs. So I couldn‚Äôt leave anyways and I own her money cause job searching in my field of more isn‚Äôt east and I refuse to get paid way less. But I have and interview next week and it real promising.

Not only that but her family loves me and I love them. It‚Äôs nice to actually be apart of a family for once. 

Any advice you have for me or if you‚Äôve been through the same type of situation. What did you do? What helped you in your relationship? Any advice at this point would be greatly appreciated!

If you‚Äôve gotten this far thank you for listening to me. I appreciate it.","Oh you fucked up, you fucked up in the same way i did that lead to my divorce.

1st off you put your value of her way above your value of yourself. You need to show her that if she wants to have a loving partner then she needs to show appreciation for your effort you put in to the relationship. Nobody respects a partner that puts them on a pedastal and worships them. All you are doing is making yourself look cheap and desperate. 

1st thing 1st is to check for the cheater red flags to make sure you are dealing with a falling out of love issue and not a partner stepping out issue. Then after that you need to focus on yourself and putting that effort to making you more valueable in your own life. Not to say neglect your partner but take an unannounced break from all the ""above and beyond"" extra things you do for her. Let this new routine start for a bit then have a serious talk about the needs that must be met for this relationship to work.

You want to spoil her but that only can work if she spoils you equally. Boundries should be set, and respect should be given. And know through all this you can not force someone to love you or stay with you. The effort must come from your partner if they want you to start putting back in the effort you have previously shown. If they refuse to put effort into the relationship then there is no relationship. There needs to be a redress in the status quo or you are gonna be broken up in actions way before its verbally broken off.

For now work on yourself, observe to see if she changes once your focus is on yourself, verify cheater flags, then if she notices the change in your effort have a long talk about what is needed to go back to the way things were."

dating,145vnb3,2023-06-10 09:26:18,Why do men love bomb? [m23] [f23],"
I met an Italian guy in Rome on a tinder date and within the first 2 weeks he was head over heels for me. He‚Äôd say things like, ‚ÄòI think we‚Äôre on the path of love‚Äô, and ‚Äòthere‚Äôs just something about you‚Äô and ‚ÄòI will come visit you when you go back to England the flight is only 2 hours‚Äô *sends screenshots of flight times* within the first few days. We only spent 3 days together in person and kept texting because he said please keep talking to me when you go back because I will visit. At first I was overwhelmed and found it too much, but after a few days of chatting I started to catch feelings for him. We continued to speak and FaceTime for a couple of weeks and   I had never felt so on top of the world in my life. He was my first kiss, and I was 21, But then he started replying slowly, his long texts went to just a few texts a day. I couldn‚Äôt understand bc it wasn‚Äôt like I had changed how I was with him. I could see what was happening and I broke down in tears. He told me it wasn‚Äôt that he didn‚Äôt like me, but the distance is too far. ‚ÄòIf we were closer he would have kept seeing me. yes it is right you should see somebody else, someone you deserve‚Äô. It took me a year to get over him, because I had tasted what it felt like to have somebody and I craved it so bad. My mental health is better now, so I don‚Äôt feel the need for a partner, and I can barely remember his voice. But what do you think went through his head? Because to this day I couldn‚Äôt tell you what went wrong.","What went wrong? 

He manipulated you, and you took the bullet. That's it. Love bombing is never a positive thing, you should be careful. People will use it to manipulate, intentionally or not."
dating,145vcq9,2023-06-10 09:10:04,"Tired of being single for so long, but options seem non-existent","I guess the best way to describe the situation for me at the moment is being tired of the same old nothing day in and day out despite very much wanting to have another person to share my life with, so I figure that by venting here maybe something will change.  


So for background I'm a 37 year old male interested in women, but it's been over a decade since I had any sort of serious relationship. The last one I had was back in college, and since then I've had a few flings, but never anything serious. And that last failed relationship was a mutual break-up as we both had past relationships that we hadn't fully moved on from at the time.  


Anyways, since then I pretty much focused on myself. I gave myself 3 requirements to dating as an adult (remember I was fresh out of college and entering the real world); get my own place, get my own vehicle and have a stable, well paying job. To some degree I always had those things, with maybe one period where I quit my job and didn't work for 2 months, but at the present I own my own home, my own vehicle and make enough money that I can do some remodeling on my home and treat myself to some nicer things (vacations, electronics, etc). But the entire time I always kept an eye out for that special someone and it's yielded nothing. I've read enough posts on here to know one of the knee-jerk reactions is for commenters to say ""you're trying too hard"" and ""the moment you stop looking is when you'll find someone"", but that's just not true. I've had several people tell me I'm not putting myself out there enough, but IMO they basically want me to seek someone desperately.   


I do try put myself out there though, I've joined social clubs and sport leagues, I regularly go to festivals and shows, and I even go to get togethers my friends host who tell me ""there's going to be a lot of single women there"", but it's all pretty fruitless. Oh, and I guess it's worth mentioning I have used 2 online dating sites as well, but for the last year at least I've basically given up on them as the people I was matched with were comically bad pairings. I never really had any dates as a result and maybe a conversation that lasted about 3 messages back and forth. And to be clear it's not that I'm being rejected, I've met plenty of women who are into me, but they are just not what I'm looking for.  


I actually think my main problem is where I live, smack dab in the center of Alberta, Canada. I grew up in rural Alberta and moved around a bit before settling near a major city, but the vast majority of people I meet fall within a few stereotypes, all of which I want nothing to do with. I don't want to go into too much specifics, otherwise I'll be here all day, but just 2 examples would people who describe themselves as country girls who ""aren't like the other girls"" because I like hunting and fishing and riding ATV's and drinking beer, or women who seem to need to form a circle of friends that their life revolves around, that gives me the feeling of a life that is more for show rather than natural. And don't get me wrong, I too like fishing, and there's nothing wrong with women drinking beer, and women having friends is fine too, but it's more that these are the things that these people choose to define themselves. I just want to find someone independent and creative and genuine that I can feel something real with. And those kind of people are out there, but I feel like at this point in time they're already married (most of the people my age are), or they run in crowds that are somewhat exclusive, or at least it seems that way because I have no clue where to meet them. I actually think my best option is trying to find someone from far away, like another country, because it seems easier to find some variation there.   


Generally I'm a happy guy, outside of this one area of my life things are pretty good, sometimes even great, but there is always that part of me that is lonely, and that loneliness gets depressing more and more often the older I get. I miss taking a girl out for a date and really doing something special to surprise them. I want to make a girl smile because she came home and I made her a fancy dinner by candlelight even though there was no occasion for it. Or snuggling on the couch while watching some schmucky rom-com she loves. And while I know this is a dating sub, I want to be a father someday as well and you kind of have to succeed in the dating part before you get to those later steps. And at this point I just have to accept that even if I had a child today I'd be almost 60 by the time they turn 18, which is just so depressing.   


So yea, I guess this is just venting, but at this point I feel like expressing this would be a change and any change would be good.","Here‚Äôs an answer you might not like to hear; you‚Äôre probably physically unattractive to most women, so while ‚Äúdating is a numbers game‚Äù makes perfect sense if you‚Äôre kinda cute, just with a kilt bit of confidence and charm you can get the attention of 1 in 5 girls or something 

It makes a lot less sense when you‚Äôre not that cute, and those ‚Äúmature, good girls who look past your appearance‚Äù appear maybe 1 in 1000 women you meet‚Ä¶."

It's not anymore but still it was dropped because of lack of evidence and camera proof going against what he said but that doesn't change the fact he is black listed STILL lost 3 months worth of wages from his previous job to pay legal fees just for it all to be dropped.)...............Details/background for this incident... ( he is young fit and attractive by most standards)... ( I only know so much about everything because I was training him at the time and I reached out because I caught wind what was going on from the manager in question bragging about it in the office).......  ( The company we work at well I work at is Taco Bell the management in general is just corrupt and awful with ""dreind mafifas"" running everything but this is a new low for local management even for low standers)...

I say this stuff but even being scared I can't help but feel alone it's not like I haven't dated before but the Dateing environment has changed so much and it's not the same as highschool and long distance is just as scary because of doxing.( I'm at a loss I don't know what to do.

dating,145v9ny,2023-06-10 09:05:15,"I hate the whole nice guy thing, it makes me feel hopeless about dating","I (19m) want to be the most caring, kind, and respectful person I can be for everyone, especially in dating because its who I am.

The problem I‚Äôve been having is when I‚Äôm texting or talking to a girl, I try to be me, which is kind, respectful, a good listener, but the conversations fizzle out and go nowhere, even if I‚Äôm being as open and interested as possible. Then I see the whole nice guys finish last stuff on social media and it just makes me sad

I guess I may be just a hopeless romantic but I would really like to be in a romantic relationship and love someone, something I‚Äôve never had before, and everything to do with the nice guy stuff just gives me doubts about myself and my dating life. I don‚Äôt want to change myself, I‚Äôve struggled with this for so long.

Anyone have any advice? Thanks in advance.","It's important not to generalize your experiences based on what you see in social media or hear from others.

It's also worth mentioning that being a ""nice guy"" is not inherently a bad thing. In fact, being kind, respectful, and a good listener are great qualities to have in a relationship. What often **becomes a problem** is when ""niceness"" is not balanced with assertiveness, setting boundaries, and showing genuine interest in the other person as an individual. Here are a few tips:

1. **Be interested:** Ask questions about her interests, opinions, and experiences. Genuine curiosity often leads to more engaging conversations.

2. **Be yourself:** Continue being respectful and kind, but also be true to your interests and passions. Don't feel like you need to hide your nerdy or dorky side. Many people are attracted to those who are passionate and knowledgeable about something, even if it's considered ""nerdy"".

3. **Be assertive:** Assertiveness isn't about being aggressive or demanding, it's about expressing your needs and wants clearly. If you want to take a relationship to the next level, don't be afraid to express that.

4. **Set boundaries:** Know your values and don't compromise them for the sake of being ""nice"". If something makes you uncomfortable, express it.

5. **Don't rush:** It might take some time to find the right person, and that's okay. Enjoy the process of getting to know different people and learning about yourself.

Remember, **it's better to be single than to be in a relationship where you can't be yourself.** Don't let the ""nice guys finish last"" narrative discourage you. There are plenty of people out there who appreciate and seek out kindness in a partner. It might take time, but you'll find someone who loves and appreciates you for who you are."
dating,145v74j,2023-06-10 09:01:32,How to maximize chances with crush of five years,"I've had a massive crush on a girl since I met her at university a few years ago.

She is one of the most gorgeous women I've ever known; tall, dark, has a beautiful natural smile, and she doesn't even wear makeup. She is smart, full of warmth and character, level headed, and elegant. This is quite a rare person I think.

While at university I could have sworn I saw her starting sometimes. I never asked her out in person. We had some friendly exchanges throughout uni.

This year however I did ask her if she was interested in a message, and called her, but she didn't even view the message. I didn't want to seem desparate so left it at that.

In about a month I happen to be (probably) traveling to her hometown on my own for a couple of nights for work. What's the best way forward to maximize my chances?

I know there'll be those who'll say to drop it, but I just want to give it my best go before I put this thing to bed... I don't want to give up incase there is a chance.

Thank you!","Here are some suggestions that might help you:

1. **Communication**: Try to re-establish a connection with her without directly referencing your previous message. If she hasn't seen the message, it could be due to a number of reasons, and it's important not to assume the worst. You could start with something casual, like sharing a memory from your university days, or talking about something you know she's interested in.

2. **Hometown Visit**: You could mention your upcoming trip and ask her if she has any recommendations for places to visit, eat, or things to do in her hometown. This is a non-threatening way to express your interest in her and your shared experiences. 

3. **Respect Her Space**: It's very important not to seem too eager or insistent. Give her some time to respond, and respect her personal space. Remember, no response is also a response, and it's essential to respect her choices.

4. **Suggest a Meet-up**: If she seems open to chatting and responds positively, you could suggest meeting up while you're in her town. But phrase it in a way that puts no pressure on her, something like, ""I'll be in town on these dates. If you're free and comfortable, it'd be great to catch up over a coffee."" 

5. **Be Honest and Direct**: If you feel like she's responsive and comfortable with your conversation, there might be an opportunity to express your feelings. However, be careful not to put any pressure on her. 

6. **Prepare for any outcome**: It's important to be mentally prepared for any outcome, whether she matches your feelings or not. Either way, remember that it's brave of you to express your feelings, and you should be proud of yourself for taking that step.

Remember, the most important thing is to be respectful of her feelings and decisions. Good luck!"
dating,145v19u,2023-06-10 08:52:07,Is this what falling out of Love is like?,"So an year and half before I(24F) lost my dad and was going through a very difficult time when I met this guy (25M). I had met him a couple of times before this but nothing serious. Ever since my father was not around anymore, he used to talk to me through entire days making sure I was doing okay. He texted me throughout the day for over a month while I was in my hometown. When I came back to the city we saw each other and we kissed. In that moment I felt so sure that he is The One for me. 
Fast forward to today, I feel he is just human. I realise my grief was so huge at the time that I would take anything that would make me feel better. He treats me good, but it's hard to have a conversation with him because we are on such different pages about everything. I have been dormant for a long time trying to heal, but now when I feel ready to go out with people, meet friends my partner doesn't think it's okay. His entire family know about me. I have been feeling that the spark has been missing for a long time. I don't know what to do or how to. Any suggestions?","I'm sorry to hear about your situation. It's a complex one, and it's okay to feel confused. It sounds like you may have originally seen this relationship as a safe harbor during an incredibly tough time in your life, which is perfectly normal. However, as you've started to heal and regain your independence, you're noticing differences that didn't seem as significant before. 

Falling out of love can be a process of recognizing that what you need and want from a relationship has changed, or that the person you're with isn't able to meet your needs. This can be gradual or sudden, but usually involves feelings of distance, disconnection, or dissatisfaction.

Communication is key here. Express your feelings honestly with him. Let him know how you've been feeling and what you want to change. You may also want to consider seeking professional advice, like a relationship counselor, who can provide guidance based on your specific circumstances.

Remember, your feelings are valid. It's okay to have loved someone for what they provided at a certain time, and it's okay to realize that they might not be the right person for you forever. It's important to prioritize your own growth and happiness."

I also don't like to generalize but, I have a new boyfriend now and every time I want to talk about something that is annoying me, he feels overwhelmed and stops responding. My ex used to make jokes and not take it seriously sometimes until I was completely not into him anymore, but he did answer the phone. My new boyfriend doesn't make jokes but he starts acting like he's confused and logs off aaand he doesn't answer the phone. He takes a lot of time to process what he wants to say, and although I believe that thinking before speaking is a good thing, what he does really throws me off because my anger doesn't last long. One time he took hours to respond to whatever I said and it took DAYS to have the conversation. And it was an easy fix but he made it feel like HELL. If I'm annoyed or sad about something and I talk to you about it, a few words of affirmation and a hug will calm me down immediately. I just need to be listened to and understood. But he gets all evasive and it makes it so much worse. It makes me feel like he doesn't care. He has dealt with this situation nicely before, but sometimes he just hurts me. It hurts when he is evasive. And just to clarify, this doesn't happen often. I'm not an angry person, but sometimes things bottle up and I need to have a conversation. It's normal. Communication to me is important and this is the first time it feels so difficult. Some girls say ""men"" are usually like that. Is it true? How do I deal with this?","People deal with conflict in their own ways, and it appears your boyfriend tends to avoid it. This doesn't necessarily mean he doesn't care; it might just be his way of dealing with intense situations. 

Good communication is crucial for a healthy relationship. If you feel upset by his responses, it's important to have a sincere talk about it. Approach him calmly, explaining your feelings without blaming him. For instance, you might say, ""I feel ignored when you don't respond to my messages quickly.""

You could propose communication tactics that accommodate both your needs. If he requires time to think things through, he could acknowledge he heard you but needs time to form a thoughtful response. This ensures you're not left feeling ignored.

The objective should be finding a balance that respects both your communication styles and emotional well-being. If you continue facing challenges with communication, consider seeking help from a counselor or therapist. They can provide useful strategies to improve the way you communicate in your relationship."
dating,145u3qo,2023-06-10 07:55:35,"After many relationships, I‚Äôve learned a few things that people need to hear.","This is a little word of advice for getting to know a partner before commitment ensues. I am a 34M and been in and out of the dating world. These are the few things I‚Äôve learned in my experiences:

1) Always be patient and take your time to learn about someone. It doesn‚Äôt happen in 3 months, 6 months or even within a year. Confessing your love for someone 2 months in, love bombing and expressing that you cannot live without them will scare the living hell out of healthy personality types.

2) Expressing your traumas and fears are a part of learning someone. Always be under the understanding that not all people can handle other peoples traumas or personality traits, no matter how ‚Äúright‚Äù or ‚Äúamazing‚Äù the feelings are while being with this person. 

3) In the first 6 months, don‚Äôt push to get to know their family, friends, kids or social network. Focus on them, focus on who they are with you, what they bring to the table and how you both can mesh each others needs in a relationship. Before this is solidified, nobody should be meeting anyone‚Äôs extended social network. 

4) Learn how to communicate. Everyone communicates different and lots of people have different personality traits, which include, anxious, secure and avoidant attachment styles. In order for any relationship to succeed, both parties need to make sure they are comfortable with the way they are able to communicate their feelings, frustrations, issues and ideas to the person they want to be with. 

5) Do not try to change yourself or another person to fit the relationship status quo. They may be gorgeous, intimate, attractive, but changing your likes and personality to suit someone else‚Äôs needs or wants will end up in disaster. Be yourself, let them fall in love with who you are not who they want you to be. 

6) Do not use sex as a distraction from the issues that stem from a relationship. Sex can be amazing, you may feel this person is so attracted to you and can make you feel amazing. But, the second arguments or disagreements are put under the rug and sex is the main priority, it will blow up later on. Trust me. 

7) Most people are aware of what manipulation and toxicity is. Do not be offended if someone removes themselves from your life if you are portraying toxic behaviors or emotionally abusive tactics. 

8) Most breakups hurt the most because people fall into this cloud of ‚Äúlove‚Äù that because you love this person they would do nothing to hurt you even if they have expressed their issues with the relationship. The only way that gets fixed if you deal with the issue at hand. If one partners issues keep going undiscussed or stone walled, expect the other person to pull back due to the lack of respect when bringing up important things. 

9) Nobody is responsible for your happiness but you! If you are recognizing unhealthy behaviors when starting relationships, step back, get some therapy and love yourself before you love someone else. You will thank me. 

10) Do not stay in any relationship no matter how amazing if you feel unsafe or walking on constant eggshells no matter the reason. Life is to short to waste. 

Edit:

11) When one partner deicdes to call it quits, give each other the respect and time to heal. Even if you don't think you should be apart, time = clarity. DO NOT contact their friends, their family, or anyone on your partners side regarding your emotions or to get info on your ex. Its toxic, if you ever have a chance to get back together, this will truly destory it. 

12) Understanding why the relationship broke down is important. It helps you understand who you are, what changes to make moving forward and being grateful that you had the chance to learn from all this. DO NOT beat yourself up, FORGIVE yourself for it, because you are 1 in 8 billion in terms of humans in this world. You‚Äôre leaning, just like everyone else. 8 billion other people are also going through the same roller coaster ride and learning who they are. Be kind to yourself, be patient, there is no perfect way of doing any of this. Relationships are meant to break down, its how we get back up that makes us who we are. Love yourself. 

Hope this helps! Please add in any other points to help people out in this group.","**TL;DR:** Through my dating experiences, I've learned key relationship advice:

- Take time to know someone
- Understand that not everyone can handle your traumas
- Don't rush into meeting their social network
- Communication is key
- Don't change yourself for someone
- Avoid using sex to avoid issues
- Be aware of toxic behaviors
- Deal with issues directly in a relationship
- Remember, you're responsible for your own happiness
- Don't stay in uncomfortable relationships
- Respect post-breakup healing time
- And finally, Understand and learn from your past relationships.

Remember, you're on a journey, just like everyone else. **Love yourself first.**"
dating,145u2jo,2023-06-10 07:53:40,Should I pursue him?,"
Hi, so i (23F) have a situation.
I am currently have been crushing on my co-worker (25M). Its been going on for like 6 months+. But i never wanted to date him just because we work very closely and i think it would be weird if i try to shoot my shot while being in the same company, I just think he‚Äôs a spectacular man, a good friend and just a fun guy to be around.

But recently he told us that he‚Äôs resigning from his position to pursue another job at another company and basically will be moving out of town for this new job (he‚Äôll be resigning next month).

And now he‚Äôs not going to be my co-worker anymore I feel like I should confess or at least try to get closer to him. But if we do get together it would be LDR and idk if thats good enough.

I‚Äôve heard from other co-workers that he‚Äôs also interested in me but hesitated to ask me out because of our social status.

Thank you in advance and please help","It sounds like a complex situation, but it really boils down to whether you're willing to take the risk of confessing your feelings and potentially starting a long-distance relationship (LDR).

From what you've shared, it seems there might be mutual interest, but the work situation and the potential LDR seem to be the main factors holding both of you back. Here are some things to consider:

1. **Your feelings for him**: You've been crushing on this guy for over half a year, so it's not just a fleeting attraction. Is this strong enough that you're willing to potentially enter an LDR?

2. **Mutual interest**: Rumor has it that he's also interested in you. If this is true, then your chances of getting a positive response to your confession are higher.

3. **Long-distance relationship**: LDRs can be challenging due to distance, differences in schedule, and the reduced amount of physical interaction. Are you prepared to handle these challenges?

4. **Timing**: He's about to start a new job in a new city, which can be a stressful transition. Will he be open to starting a relationship during this period?

In the end, only you can decide what's best for you. If your feelings are strong and you're willing to navigate the complexities of an LDR, it might be worth expressing your feelings and seeing where things go. Regardless of his response, at least you'll know you took a chance rather than wondering ""what if?"" later on."

dating,145slwi,2023-06-10 06:30:56,I feel very uneasy about the dating world.,"I have a little dillemma;

I'm fairly young (18) and I have little experience in the dating world. (I said little. I have had 2 girlfriends in my time.) I'm introverted by nature (I always have been) and I'm a little socially awkward but generally I can have a good one on one conversation with someone and I'm pretty good looking. I'd say at least above average. 

I'm not in a particularly good positon to go out and meet people at the moment considering that living in the rural midwest is kinda boring. I don't have many friends or a consistent social circle. (I don't really mind having two friends, but women for some reason like guys who have a prominent social circle.)

So as a result of this I took to the dating apps because that seems like my best option at the moment. But whenever I use the apps I get barely any matches at all. But that's not even what's bothering me the most. (compared to what I'm about to tell you it is a marginal issue because it doesn't surprise me)

My main problem is this endless swiping, and reading bios of women's profiles just to have nearly all of them blend into one another. Almost nobody sticks out, and the ones that do stick out to me are very unlikely to notice me to begin with. 

But the main issue is that most women don't stick out at all. They all like the same crappy rap and pop music I hate listening to. Alot of them think owning a cat or dog makes them special (it doesn't. 66% of the American population owns a household pet.) Not only that but they all dress very similarly and have similar phrases in their bios. (I can't even give an example, that's how forgettable they are.)

These dating apps are designed for the benefit of women rather than men. It's like they an just swipe on any random guy and instantly get them without even having to put effort in. (Hence the boring, recycled profile backgrounds)

I'm not saying mine is much better either, I'm sure my profile looks the same as a lot of other guys out there, and that is probably why I fly under the radar like most young men my age. I don't exactly impress women I'm a fairly run of the mill average guy. But these women aren't impressing me either. I swipe right on a huge majority of profiles even if they have marginal differences to one another. I do think nearly everyone deserves a fair chance, maybe these girls could be fun to hang around with, you never know. But once again, I'm not exactly impressed with most of their underwhelming choices of words. 

People lack enthusiasm in their profiles. They're all cryptic and vague, without any information on how they act being displayed what so ever. I get you have so little space to get the point across of who you are in a couple sentences and that it takes a more intimate face to face conversation to exchange more vital information on one's values, personality, and experiences but I'm not exactly getting to make any progress. 

I know I'm young and have alot of time to figure this stuff out. Also being 18 is the worst age to date because I'm still too immature for most women older than 19. But I'm still uneasy about what's to come in the future considering I have bad anxiety and have difficulties approaching people. (Which will be solved with time and experience. But I need to start soon if I'm going to make any progress and dating apps aren't exactly making it easier.)

I'd join a club but I'm unemployed and have no car. (Soon to change, I have an interview coming up in the next couple weeks. I'm confident I'll get the job because I'm prepared to give them a ton of good reasons why I need the job.)

Idk. If I could have some words of wisdom from you older folks or just someone to reassure me that I should keep going my own way for now and not sweat it so much. I'm a bit lonely and I need a little bit of humanity to cheer me up.",

Hi all,

I'm (F31) together with my partner(M35) for 2 years now. When we argue, I want to talk things out. He shuts down/ignores me (over text, we don't live together). He can ignore me for 2 days.

Today I found out that he ignored his mother for a full week!! She started to cook his favourite meal to get things okay again, but he refused to eat it. 

It's like his mother wants to do everything to get things right again. 

I was thinking today and I'm thinking of breaking up with him.  If we have a problem, I want to talk it out with him. He can't,  instead he ignores me. He does the same to his mom for a full week!!! I will be like his mom one day, getting ignored for a full week. Such a disrespect.

Am I overreacting for wanting to break up? This is a huge red flag imo. Ignoring your mother for a full week!!!!?","It will only get worse unless he commits to do the extremely demanding hard work of changing. Being shut out like that when you have valid concerns to raise is kind of like being emotionally abandoned by your partner. I definitely wouldn‚Äôt want to sign up for that. If he‚Äôs willing to truly work on it and improve/grow, I would be open to seeing how things go."

Btw this is something that is totally in her wheelhouse and she enjoys it. Nothing romantic or anything. She said she wasn't ready to be in a relationship and she could see it going that way. She could have been just letting me down easy but what comes next makes me wonder. Told her I respected that and it was fine, just assumed we were done talking. Well 2 weeks later I saw her and her family at an event. Apparently her mom told my mom that she wasn't comfortable in a 1 on 1 setting, but she would hang in a group. So it's not completely off the table?

Im confused because there has been multiple times she could have turned me down. When I asked for her number she could have said no, but she told me to ask her dad. She could have told her dad to deny me, but he told me I was good. She said no to a date but then comes back and still wants to hang out. We started talking again and it's like we never stopped.

dating,145rlpi,2023-06-10 05:34:26,How to date again after heartbreak?,"I‚Äôve (25M) dated a lot of women. Never really fell in love with anyone until I met this girl in the second half of 2022. She broke my heart in January of this year. That‚Äôs a story for another day. 

But the point is, this person forever changed my perspective. I was in love with her. She made me want to have kids, she made me smile when she ate her meals, It was never sex that I craved with her, I just craved holding and cuddling with her sweet and gentle self. Etc etc, all the love. 

Now with that being said, how in the hell am I supposed to date again? I am constantly disappointed by people I meet in dating apps, Instagram, and in person. People never seem to want anything serious, the entitlement is through the roof, and nobody can even come close to matching the energy I felt with my past girl. I‚Äôm not even trying to compare, it‚Äôs just hard to when I know what perfection is, you know? 

And also another issue. I can‚Äôt even have sex anymore. Like seriously. Pre-heartbreak, I was all for casual sex, but nowadays, I think of it is as my most vulnerable asset that I don‚Äôt want to give away unless it‚Äôs to the right person. After my heartbreak, I tried to mess around with multiple girls to get over her, but I found myself crying myself to death afterwards. Which was another telltale sign that I was really in love. 

Needless to say, the last person I had sex with was in March. It was a close friend of mine (as opposed to just a fwb or hookup) and it just felt right in the moment. But when I was close to finishing, she had me look in her eyes, and then I finished, and then I excused myself to the bathroom and cried again. That‚Äôs when I legit realized that I‚Äôm just so mentally fucked from this girl and I just legit cannot have sex. 

You see, I want a girl so bad that I can just share life with, and yet I just can‚Äôt see to bring myself to do it. I‚Äôm trying so hard to forget about her, but the world just doesn‚Äôt want me to do for some reason. 

What can I do to move on? I‚Äôm distracting myself by working 65+ hours a week, I have my own place, I‚Äôm in nursing school. I eat healthy. I go to the gym. But I‚Äôm still stupidly lonely and sad. Yet I am disappointed by most of the dating market‚Ä¶ what to do?

TLDR: How can I date again after my my favorite girl? How do I manage fighting loneliness with fighting my brain‚Äôs constant reminders of my past girl?","Learn to love yourself and your own company first.

These are all men in their early 20s, it‚Äôs same with everyone we would start making out they would be mind-blown by me (I consider myself good looking I have always gotten compliments and many guys) so these guys will shower me with compliments like you‚Äôre so pretty, sexy, beautiful etc‚Ä¶ Boom! they can‚Äôt keep erection and end up doing a mediocre job, they remain semi-hard so basically not even proper sex at that point.

dating,145qz9z,2023-06-10 04:59:55,I (18F) drunkenly kissed a girl (17F) and she says she felt forced?,"Hello everyone, I (18F) am traveling right now, and am on my way back home soon. I just broke up with my first boyfriend (he was my first everything), and I was honestly sort of semi-open to rebounds on my trip.
The issue comes when I was hanging out with a girl (17F) that I met through a mutual hobby. She invited me to hang out and dance/drink with her friends in a park together, and so I went and got a little too messed up. 
I kissed her friend, but quickly realized that I was not into him so I turned him down and he was very respectful about it. I was still upset about kissing someone other than my ex, so the two girls (one of them being the one I kissed), went off to leave, and ended up talking about how it was okay that I was moving on from my ex boyfriend. 

This is where it gets weird, I was alone with the girl since her friend had to leave, so we tried to get food and eventually started to make out. I was still very very drunk at this time, and she asked me how people kiss in a certain way, so I offered to show her and she accepted. It led to basically making out for half an hour, in a situation where I was drunk still and she was completely sober. It was okay, but I regret it even without what she said, so I was already feeling strange about it. 

Today she texted me and said that she felt I forced her into it, and that she was uncomfortable but did not know how to say no. She also said she was trying to push me away a bit, but at the time she was kissing me back, so it confuses me that she was apparently doing that. Also that she did not know how to say no, and that it was sort of her fault she gave me the wrong idea, and that she regrets it. 

The main part of why I am so thrown off, is that I asked her explicitly if she was okay with things I was doing, and she said yes. I specifically asked her for consent while we were kissing, and each time she said yes, and I was drunk and unable to realize that her yes was secretly a no??? She says she did not know how to say no, but I feel like since she was sober, there were many opportunities when I specifically asked her if I was ok or not to touch her or kiss her, where she said a clear yes. She is the third person I have ever kissed, first girl, and I don‚Äôt really know where to go from here. 

I texted her in response that I regretted it but that I wished she said no when I asked her if it was okay, instead of being enthusiastic with kissing me and saying yes. I am so weirded out that I went past someone‚Äôs boundaries, but at the same time am sort of upset that she said yes to things and went along with it, especially with the parts she said she was uncomfortable with. I know for a fact I asked if it was okay to touch her, to which she said yes and she was touching me too, and I just feel so uncomfortable. 

She knew I was very drunk the entire time as well, which just makes me feel even stranger personally, especially as I would assume that since she was completely sober, she could‚Äôve said anything other than yes when I asked for her consent. If she had said something, anything, I would‚Äôve stopped, I just can‚Äôt understand why she accepted my requests for consent and kept going with me if she felt the way she did this morning about it. 

What do I do from this point? I regret it so much even without knowing that she felt like that (kissing anyone honestly so soon after my breakup), but now I regret it even more with her telling me she didn‚Äôt want it. I just can‚Äôt understand, since I asked for consent and got the green light. She seems to regret it too at the least, and I asked if she was okay/mentally stable after it and she says yes, it just weird me out. 

Any advice would be appreciated, thank you for reading :(


TLDR: I drunkenly kissed a sober girl (3rd kiss in my life), and she feels I pressured her into doing uncomfortable things (touching her and kissing) after the fact. She says she did not know how to tell me no, but I feel upset because I specifically asked for consent multiple times, and do not know why she would say yes and then tell me I forced her into what we mutually (?) agreed to. Am so confused right now.","Listen what you did was fine. You asked and she said yes. The truth is, after she thought about it, she feels embarrassed and maybe even uncomfortable with her choices. You did nothing wrong and you certainly didn‚Äôt take advantage or anything like that. You did the right thing by asking if she was ok with it. Anything after that is her responsibility to speak up."

We run in the same concert going/small town bar crowd. Well neither of us hit the bar too much anymore. It‚Äôs just where we met. 

Anyways I‚Äôve had two pretty toxic relationships. One was very physically abusive and the other was just extremely neglectful and I thought it was normal because he wasn‚Äôt hurting me. 

Bob and I have been texting pretty consistently for the last 6 months and hung out a few times. I‚Äôm a single mom and he works a ton. We both were supportive during a break up. Recently he told me that he adores me and would like to know if I‚Äôd be open to him taking me on an actual date and see where things go. I am 100% down. Well tomorrow we are seeing each other for the first time since then and I am going with him to a family cook out. 

I‚Äôm extremely nervous and kind of trauma dumped all my baggage, because I don‚Äôt know how to date the nice normal guy. I apologized and said sorry if that was too heavy and he said it was a lot and it was heavy, but not too much and asked if I had ever had someone in my corner, because now I do. I‚Äôm worried he is regretting inviting me to this event now, because anxiety is a jerk and I am nervous in a way I have never been because now it is known we both have feelings towards each other.

dating,145pbl6,2023-06-10 03:30:14,I Can't Keep Going.,"It is ironic that I am writing this post in the first place. I had always been an introvert, someone who had found peace in being by his lonesome, away from the chaos of socializing with people to whom I had no idea if their feelings and thoughts of me were manipulations or genuine. To think I would type this out, ever, only goes to show me how much I've grown desperate...or perhaps how much the attempts of finding your dream beloved have begun to wound me.

Now, I find myself unable to just stomach the rejections, the silence, the loneliness that taunts me whenever I have to see those around me flourish and bloom with the treasures they seek. I just can't. I care little of those that'll tell me ""you're still too young"" to worry about love, because rest assured, my youth has been nothing less than absolute pain, constant manipulation and depression, and an all around shroud of sadness that I'll never shake from. I've nowhere been out of the darkness yet, so don't you dare assume that I am having it lovely and that I'm just a misguided youth. 

I hear it is fine to live a life alone, without love or affection or even a partner. Yet, it always seems to be shunned or made fun of, like there's this stigma towards it.

So me and this girl go to same college or did as I am transferring now. We knew of eachother for almost 8 months but never got really close despite hanging within a group of friends a couple of times. I had not seen her in a few months but run into eachother last day of semester. We talked hanged out that day and continued to text over the next week. I ask her out and she agrees.

  
First Date goes amazing. One more week of texting and second date happens, goes okay not as good as first though. Both lasted around 5 hours with multiple places included. We plan our third date for Yesterday and continue texting throughout the week leading up to the date. This texting she seems way more into it and enthusiastic than normal which was a good sign to me.

  
As you know the Canada fire happens, and NYC gets killed with smoke and makes the outside unbearable. While texting I bring up the fact of the weather as our date was for an outdoors event offer to go somewhere else or reschedule if the even is canceled. She says she‚Äôs unsure about our date tomorrow because of the weather and we agree to check tomorrow how it is. So tomorrow happens, (The day of date) and we text in the morning as usual and I ask her what she was thinking of the weather and that I could go today or wait for the weekend if she felt uncomfortable. She doesn‚Äôt respond to that for 4 hours and the time of the date is coming up shortly, so I double text to tell her we should go during the weekend as the air quality is still bad unless she‚Äôs not free then we‚Äôll go today and to let me know if we‚Äôre still going today as the event is an hour away from me so I could start making my way there.

  
Doesn‚Äôt respond until she gets off work which was around the time I was supposed to meet her, that she‚Äôs so sorry and that she got busy at work and that she‚Äôll let me know for what day during The Weeknd. I responded with a heart reaction and to just let me know and that any day of the weekend would work. This morning we texted as usual I don't bring up the date at all but we text really chill briefly and a she seemed into it for the most part but did not mention anything however I ended it shortly.

  
At this point I am pretty sure she is not going to let me know anything. Should I just cut all contact with her? We usually daily text with me initiating it most of it? Im either thinking of texting her through the week like normal and try to set up another date. Or just stop initiating contact and in a week or so text to see her energy.","I would move on honestly. You've already asked her several times about this third date, and she's pretty much dodging it or ignoring it every time. Why keep essentially begging her to go on the date with you?

Though amazing, I was nervous. It was daytime, I was self conscious. I couldn't orgasm. He seemed very offput by this. Things seemed weird. He kissed me goodnight differently. A few days later I texted him ""You taking me to o-town??"" And he said ""lol apparently I don't know where that is.."" Then I said ""You know I'm hot for you. Be my hero"" 35 minutes later he didn't respond. I ended up ending it by saying ""Look, I know you're not that into me. It was fun, no hard feelings‚úåÔ∏è"" And he said ""No hard feelings‚úåÔ∏è"" My friend said I was wrong to end it, he does like me. I don't know if I should text him something more or not.

Update: First of all, we did talk about this immediately after. I explained to him that I was self conscious, and that he was incredible. I also texted him and told him the next morning. I was trying to move past it, and there's more to the story as to why I made both of those comments to him, but it's too much to explain in this post.

I ended up texting him, completely opening up about how I felt and being honest about my thought process, and how I got scared he was going to break things off with me. He never texted me back. I really did not think he would be like that. I thought he would at least say something. That's ok though. I signed up for eHarmony so there's bound to be more sex and heartbreak in my future.

dating,145ov8p,2023-06-10 03:06:46,Did I sleep around too much? (20-something man),"TL,DR: I'm worried that the amount of people I've slept with, and the habits I've developed, are gonna screw me over in the long run. Also, might have screwed up a new love interest.

&#x200B;

I'm totally gonna get flamed for this, but I'm still gonna post because I don't have a lot of advice-givers in my life rn. So to start, I'm a 20-something dude who's about a year out of a 5ish year relationship. To cope, I slept around a lot last fall. It's been 23 people I think, and I've picked up the douchebag attitude. For the past few months I've stopped mostly. I'm worried that I've solidified myself as a player because I'd never lie to a SO about my history, and the question will always come up. (FYI, always safe, no STDs)

Anyways, some advice about the above would be appreciated. Maybe some stories of past players finding love and losing the casual life?

&#x200B;

Now for the regret part. I'm not asking for sympathy or judgement here, I know what I did was dumb as hell. I guess it's just an example of my new behavior, which I'll now be working on weeding out of me. So I've been talking to a girl for a little over a month. We've kept in touch, but I had to leave for the summer (quite a ways away, think half a country lol) so I decided to wait until we had the exclusivity talk until after, because we need more time to build feelings. 

Anyways, I wound up convincing myself that because we're still in the ""talking stage,"" I should go get some hookups out of my system to solidify my transition into being monogamous again (stupid). Got hit up by someone on my socials, turns out she kinda knows my love interest sort of, I don't think they keep in touch though. She has an open relationship bf, so I knew it'd be a casual FWB type thing with no feelings. We slept together (VERY stupid), and now I'm paranoid my love interest found out and is gonna find me sleazy. To be fair, I have bad OCD and I could be making a mountain out of a molehill. But we're definitely not ""just in the talking stage."" My love interest and I haven't had sex yet. We probably could have, but I wanted to wait and have it be special. Still though, we've hugged and snuggled and done cute stuff. I feel so filthy for seeking casual stuff. So genuinely wrong of me.

Regardless of whether or not she hears about it, or whether or not we work out, I know this isn't the kind of behavior I wanna continue doing in the future. It's so immature, I need to stop hooking up especially when I'm emotionally interested in someone. I'd never cheat after the official exclusivity talk, though. Stating that firmly with 100% confidence.

Also, just for good measure, GOD I'm dumb. So damn stupid. Thoughts and advice is welcome.","If she were to find out oh well. You guys weren‚Äôt even offical yet. For all you know she could have been doing the same thing as you. So dont feel bad. Bro you‚Äôre 20 something , you‚Äôll have alot more potential love interest down the line. Just keep on doing you and be safe."

dating,145oa39,2023-06-10 02:36:50,Is this just how dating is now a days or is something wrong with me?,"In the last several years I (24f) have met several guys or started to see guys ive been friends with for years. Every single time, they act infatuated with me, talking to me constantly, thanking me for talking to them, telling them they cant believe I even like them, talking about moving in together, making all these plans, wanting to see me all the time and being so insanely sweet to me. Then after a couple months (2-5) all of a sudden with no change from me, they just stop, and start acting really weird towards me like I did something wrong, always telling me they're busy, some of them even straight up block me on social media literally less than 24 hours after telling me how much they like me, but the second I address them on it and letting them know if theyre not into it anymore its totally fine and they can let me know they always give me a reason they never tell me they arent into it anymore. Its making me have anxiety when someone is interested in me because I know the same thing will happen as this has happened with every single guy....i have never found an actual relationship because of this, this has happened now with about 5-7 guys now, even guys ive known and have been close with for 10 years. Im losing my mind. Is this just how it is now?","That's not just how it is now. These guys are just telling you what you want to hear to hook up with you temporarily, and you're believing it. Especially with the constant contact and future plans to move in after only dating a couple months. Those are red flags. But they don't genuinely like you as a long-term partner so it fades after a short while because it was never really there. And it's not that unusual even for people you've been close friends with for 10 years. I would say it's more expected in those situations. It's more unusual for romantic feelings to develop after being just friends for so long. It happens all the time in movies but a lot less often in real life."
dating,145o8d1,2023-06-10 02:34:30,I (27f) cannot get a date and I feel like something is wrong with me.,"I had a nasty breakup two years ago. One cheating ex, few horrible things said, long story short I was a mess and single for the first time in awhile. I took a year to work on me. I knew I needed to work on myself and fall in love with my life again. I spent time with my family, friends, and went to therapy. 

Finally I felt like I was able to get back out there. I joined the apps, was not shy of matches but conversations either never went past the initial message or just died in general. No problem, so I turned to meeting people out. Actually met who I thought was a nice guy out, we talked for a couple weeks planned a date, day comes and I was ghosted. Slight ego blow but I took some time, hopped back on the apps and it was all the same bs as before so I found myself deleting them. Last month, met a guy at my gym. We talked, things seemed great, tried to plan a date but the timing wasn‚Äôt really working out that week so he totally gave up. Stopped responding to my messages and stopped coming to the gym. I‚Äôve now returned to the apps and I‚Äôm not meeting anyone worthwhile. I‚Äôve sent plenty of likes, no responses. People I do match with don‚Äôt respond. 

I just don‚Äôt get how people do this. I‚Äôve been told I‚Äôm pretty attractive, I don‚Äôt have an issue getting matches just getting people to answer.

But if you think there could be something else causing it, it might be worth asking a friend who is extremely-honest and blunt (or instead hiring a random independent dating advisor) to review your dating profile and examine the profiles of all of the guys you're going after to see whether or not you're focusing on guys somewhat 'out of your league.'"
dating,145o89p,2023-06-10 02:34:22,Women of Reddit,What are some things you wish men did more or less of in bed?,"Obligatory am Man, but....

Some comments you'll get from women on this topic are:

1. Be more vocal. Even grunts and ""oh fuck"" will go along way. You dont have to have a monologue prepared, but complete silence is less fun. Women like feeling desired and having the man give in to his impulses and let out a few gasps tells her everything she needs to hear. 

2. Help her finish. Seriously, the amount of men that dont do this is staggering. If you get off, she gets to get off too. And youre sort of obligated to help her get there even after you're done. Oral, toys, fingers, etc. Tons of different ways even if your member downstairs is tired.

3. On the topic of toys. Toys. Tons of men hate bringing out toys like dildos and vibrators because it makes them feel less competent. Men who are secure in their masculinity and understands the usefulness of a vibrating wand will unlock a womens heart a lot easier than just using your stick. The toys arent because you are lacking, they are there to enhance the good you already have. Most women love toys, if she has some and are used to it - learn to use them on her.

4. Communicate. Seriously. Just ask her what she likes and how she likes it. Every person (read: women) is different. Some like direct stimulation, some dont. Some like more rough, some like slow and passionate. Ask your women to communicate exactly what she wants and exactly what you can do to make the experience the best for her. Bonus if you ask her to masturbate in front of you if she's comfortable with that. Good way to watch and observe exactly how she does it.

5. Foreplay. This goes hand in hand with communication, but its safe to assume she wants foreplay. 90% of women do, probably more like 99%. Tease her with your words and your hands. Dont just instantly go to pound town or instantly go to her sensitive areas. Whisper in her ear, cuddle, touch and rub your hands around all the other areas. Her arms, hands, legs, neck, back, etc. Then slowly build it up to boobs, butt and vagina. Even then keep building. Lick her thighs and tease her clit. Do this until shes pressing her pelvis into you because she cant take it anymore. Then you go to town. Usually oral to penetration is a safe bet especially if you dont last long. 

And finally the zeroth rule you should never ignore:

Zero: Have fun! Seriously. If you have fun and want her to have fun, you cant go wrong."

dating,145n1vc,2023-06-10 01:35:54,Dating on Easy Mode -- Relatable?,"I'm very fortunate that I happen to be attracted to fat women as a young, fit guy in the American South. Not only have I never had more options due to America's rapid descent into morbid obesity, but I'm also fortunate because fat women have been conditioned by society to take what they can get sexually, and to have lower standards (I know, #notallfatwomen, but still).  
  
I sometimes feel like an asshole for taking advantage of this cheat code. If I were designing an ideal society, I certainly wouldn't single out some group of people to have (on average) lower standards and self-esteem for any reason. I've also pursued slender women before, but I have to put in far more effort if I want to hook up with them, and I just don't see the point, when I'm already attracted to fatter women and it's so much easier.

Then he just stops replying or initiating the conversations by that I mean, he stopped asking me questions and his replies are always dead, which ultimately made disinterested.

Was there ever any indication from either of you that you might consider more than just a work friend relationship? If so that's shitty of him not to at least tell you that he was leaving.

dating,145kq6u,2023-06-09 23:48:03,Did I mess up by not talking to this girl at work?,"Context:  
I (20m) work at a hatchery for the summer. We do many different things throughout the summer. For example we house clams and oysters for non profit organizations and for other projects. If no one needs them we plant them in the bay (dumping them in the water). We also clean the clams and oysters because they can get very dirty very fast if you aren't keeping up with them.  
Issue:  
A few days ago we had a non profit organization come to collect 75 bags full of oysters and 15 liters of clams. Anyway when they arrive there is this girl that is with this group. She and a few others are collecting the bags that they needed while I collect their clams. Afterwards we all gather around to discuss about oysters and stuff. There is about 8 of us 3 being around my age and 3 being 50 or above. During the discussion I caught the girl checking me out. I was also checking her out. We were looking at each other more than listening to the conversation. The conversation finishes and we all shake hands with each other. They leave and I don't know if I will ever be able to see her again and I feel like I should have said something to her but I didn't because my boss was right next to me and I didn't think it was appropriate at work.  
Did I mess up or am I just overthinking?

dating,145jzp3,2023-06-09 23:15:37,Guy spent a year and a half maintaining correspondence with me despite having no interest in me romantically or platonically?,"I'm sorry in advance for the length!

I (36F) met this guy (33M) last year when he reached out to me on social media. We'd followed each other for a while but had never interacted. We hit it off and when we found out we lived close to each other he said we should meet up when the weather got nicer. We continued talking for a few months, he asked me lots about myself, remembered everything I told him, he was upfront about the fact that he was attracted to both women and men, I was cool with that, and eventually we met up. First meeting was pleasant, if not a bit awkward, as we both have anxiety. When we parted, he said he would be going on vacation soon. He surprisingly kept in touch with me the entire time he was gone. After he came back, we hung out again. Touch barrier was broken this time (first by me, later by him). However, the day after he went quiet. Alright...

A week or so later I suggested we hang out again, but he said was ill. Okay. A couple weeks later I asked if he wanted to do something for his birthday, and he said he was in the middle of quitting his job and he was too burnt out to meet. Okay. He was spotty with communication over the next couple months but had assured me our rapport ""would be back"". He said his burnout had really affected him.

A bit of background info on him: this is a guy with bad anxiety, low self-esteem (by his own admission), who has trouble emotionally connecting to and talking about feelings with others (by his own admission), represses emotions (by his own admission), has vaguely alluded to experiencing numerous traumas, and is working through complicated grief over the death of a parent in 2021.

I casually, kind of jokingly admitted I had a crush on him in December when we were chatting one day. He didn't respond to that...but immediately became a lot more lively and a bit flirty after I did. However, over the winter we almost stopped talking entirely. I figured that was that. Around March though, he resurfaced and the communication became a lot more frequent. He was super playful and quite chatty, back to teasing me a lot. I didn't want to broach the topic of hanging out again, though. So we're just texting this entire time. Still, he showed concern for me when I mentioned having some issues with people (telling me he'd go after them for me), offering to send me poems he'd written when I told him I would secretly love it if someone wrote me a poem (he sent them), asking about why previous relationships of mine hadn't worked out, telling me he felt close to me, sending me links to and pictures of things I was interested in, etc.

One day I told him that I felt we kept our dynamic superficial deliberately because we're both very guarded people and it's hard for us to be vulnerable. He said he agreed and that we both have ""an awareness of it (our dynamic) going deeper"". Eventually he began broaching topics about sex (never anything hardcore; he was always very respectful and careful), and one night, apropos of nothing mentioned that we'd never had sex (as if I didn't know this?). Yet we're not sexting or anything. It's just banter. 

Another day we're chatting and I say, ""Ya know, sometimes I think we care about each other more than we're willing to admit."" No answer. BUT--and I apologize for the sheer tween cringe of this--about an hour later I check my Twitter account and there are a dozen notifications from him having liked and retweeted posts of mine, all immediately one right after the other. These were posts I'd made over the course of the week, so he deliberately went to my page to do this. It's not like he was scrolling through the day's timeline and just casually liked a bunch of stuff I tweeted. And while we initially became acquainted through Twitter, we do not interact with each other's pages because we just text. I don't think he's interacted with anything I've tweeted since last year. 

Two weeks ago I casually brought up hanging out now that summer's around the corner. Nothing implied. He immediately changed the subject.

Okay, so. A few nights ago I had an intimate dream about him. When we were talking a couple days later he said he had a ""weird"" dream about me the previous night. I said I'd had a weird dream about him too. His dream involved me dating a friend of his and showing him pictures from a vacation we'd taken. He asked what my dream was about and I said we'd just hung out. The next day I playfully asked him if I'd made any appearances in any more of his dreams and he asked if he'd been in mine. I went, ""Ha, I wish"". Then I mentioned I'd left some details out of my account of my dream the day before. He asked what I left out. I said I didn't want to say what but he wanted to know and wouldn't let it go. I was coy but he could obviously tell what it was and kept insisting I tell him. He guessed that it had been a sex dream. When I said yes he said, ""Just because I'm not romantically interested in you doesn't mean I find that weird.""

We spoke about this for a bit. I told him it wasn't cool that he hadn't been upfront with me about not being interested in me, especially when he knew I was attracted to him. He said he knew it was shitty and apologized repeatedly. He did the whole, ""I try to be a good person, but I fuck up a lot, I'm sorry"" spiel.

So...I don't understand this at all. Why spend a year and a half forging this connection with me when he clearly had no intention of having it go anywhere? Like at all? Him saying he feels close to me and yet not even wanting to hang out platonically seems bizarre. I hang out with friends I have no romantic interest in all the time. I assume he does as well. I could have understood if he'd been using me to get his rocks off on the side, but that was never even a thing; we never sexted or hooked up. Why resurface after a season of not talking to me if there's nothing there? He told me he wanted me around many, many times. Yet at the same time he kept his distance. Plus, he has tons of friends and an active social life, so it's not like he needed my friendship because he was desperate for someone to talk to. And pushing me to tell him about the sexual aspects of my dream about him seems so strange. I certainly wouldn't spend a day pushing a friend to tell me about a sex dream they had about me, especially if I wasn't into them.

tl;dr: Guy spent a year and a half fostering a connection with me and dangling the prospect of something deeper only to tell me he's not interested in me immediately after getting me to tell him about a sex dream I had about him.",This sounds like a platonic friendship on his end. Which is a great thing! You don't have to be interested in someone sexually in order to enjoy their company.
dating,145js7l,2023-06-09 23:06:46,Cute guys with dogs üò≠,"I feel like a shitty person for this but I‚Äôve had such bad experiences in the past with dogs and even from owners that say ‚Äúthey don‚Äôt bite‚Äù that I don‚Äôt even want to be around them.  I have had a couple dates where the dog would come to me for a kiss or two on the hand  and then leave me alone which was fine and I would even warm up to them to even pet them.  But then I‚Äôve had the bad experiences where I‚Äôm bleeding and being attacked by a dog while the owner(my date even) does absolutely nothing about it and then blames me for it.  I‚Äôm completely terrified of dog bites too because of all the stuff they get into. Went on another date and he assured me he had the best dogs and within 5 seconds of meeting the dog it jumps up and bites my hand as I was trying to shield my self.  Spent the rest of the date with the dog jumping on me as I tried to deflect blows and then later on he says that the dog loved to hunt mice and kills/eats them all the time. I spent a week after that date worries of all the diseases I could‚Äôve contracted and I have bad anxiety. 

Finally had enough and started telling guys before I meet them that they needed to lock up the dogs if I was coming over. This didn‚Äôt go over well and I ended up making him very upset. I don‚Äôt want dogs jumping on me or possibly scratching or biting me anymore while I‚Äôm trying to enjoy a date.  And I swear dogs can sense when you‚Äôre afraid of them because they will start to get more aggressive.  

Met a super cute guy and yep, he has a dog and so I‚Äôm here venting","If a guy can't follow your boundaries, then it's not a guy for you. You're not asking him to get rid of his pet, just to lock them up so you can slowly acclimate on your time.

I'm 99% sure my ex-boyfriend has changed his number because of my constant phone calls at the end. Also blocked me on any form of social media.  I know there may have been no excuse for my behavior, but the reason he couldn't handle it was due to my major depression and sucidal ideations that I was currently having (it is much bigger than him, struggled way before he came into the picture).  I just couldn't pull myself out of it with his advice and he gave up on me.  And the last time we talked, he said some very hurtful things.  I shut down when I am attacked or confronted in anyway.  I just got my thoughts together and wanted more closure.  But he won't give that to me.  I am making a major step, and through this I decided to start ketamine infusion therapy for my treatment resistant depression and sucidal ideations.  So, I guess this was a wake up call and a silver lining.  But even with the so very hurtful things he said at the end, I still love him.  And just wish he was around in some compacity.  He even said he didn't want to hear the milestones.  He just thinks I'm an unhinged, broken woman.  Maybe it is true. üòû","Had one of you chase me in the past. It's no fun.

In my early, rapidly coming up on mid 30's, havn't really ever done the dating scene and I'm honestly fine with that, but i have a friend who really seems to be stressing over finding companionship. I don't think he'll do dating apps, I really don't think he would be someone to do the club scene, and I've seen comments saying that we're starting to get to the age where clubs might be a bit of a weird location for us anyway... Thing is the only way I see him finding a relationship that works, is to get out there and talk to/interact with single people our age, and the only way is see this happening right now, is if i start dragging this person to those places...

dating,145ii5e,2023-06-09 22:13:21,Feeling like I‚Äôm being used by others,"Hi, I‚Äôm a 20 year old male who is currently attending university. I have been feeling like this for a while but recently it has gotten to me more because of a situation that has happened to me a couple of days ago. I am in a society at my university. There‚Äôs this girl I really like who is also in this society. One night we were going out as it was the last social we were having together as a society. So I decided I should tell her how I feel before it‚Äôs too late. I manage to get her to walk with me alone and I tell her. She says that she feels the same way and asks why I didn‚Äôt tell her sooner. This obviously makes we very happy and we spent the whole night kissing and such (but I don‚Äôt go back to hers). We spend the whole night talking and such about how we‚Äôve liked each other for a while. She also says she‚Äôs been telling other people in the society that she liked me for a while. However she mentions of a guy that she has been talking to for a while- they‚Äôre just talking nothing official. (It‚Äôs important to note that I already knew about this). And how she doesn‚Äôt know how she feels about both me and this guy. She is also going back home over the summer and she lives very far, and neither me nor this guy would be able to visit her. She mentions this to me, and I say let‚Äôs talk over the summer and try to get to know each other. She mentions that to me and say it could be a difficulty- but she doesn‚Äôt mention the other guy she is dating and how it would also be difficult for him. Bare in mind this guy lives nearby to me, so it would also be a struggle for him. She also keeps telling me I‚Äôm very handsome and that I could date anyone in the society, and asking why I like her out of everyone there. Anyway we say goodbye and leave for the night. A couple days later again by chance I‚Äôm out and she is too. So we hook up again. I had been messaging her if she‚Äôd like to go on a date a day beforehand which she said she may not have time but she‚Äôd let me know if she did. So I ask her if she knows when she is free throughout the night as she hadn‚Äôt mentioned it since but she either changes the topic of just doesn‚Äôt reply every time i ask. After sitting with her and kissing her for a while I ask if I can go back to hers . She says no I worry and ask if I overstepped. She says no she‚Äôll explain later. So we go out and she gives the explanation: ‚Äúmy opinion is too high of you to bring you back‚Äù and then proceeds to say (somewhat believably) ‚Äúif I didn‚Äôt care about you I‚Äôd defo bring you back ‚Äú. I obviously accept, although a little jealous because a friend of hers had told me she had brought the other guy back. I tell myself maybe she doesn‚Äôt want sex to be the last time she sees me. But looking back on it I just think she was making excuses up. My mates gf also said to be careful because she might be playing me. I was also a little confused by this as she had left her housemates to be with me (on the last night they were spending together as a house). I asked if she still wanted to go on a date after a couple days of not messaging her as I hadn‚Äôt actually gotten a clear response from her she hasn‚Äôt responded when I asked her in person. She hasn‚Äôt responded yet but it hasn‚Äôt been very long. She also never really spoke to me when she was sobre just on nights out as a society. Do you think she was just using me? Any advice? Because I like her very much and this has hurt me a little.",You're more likely to get advice if you make the text easy to read by using things like paragraphs.

I only recognize his face. he's most likely younger than me by 1-2 years.

He drink accessibly not every day so when i tell him off to calm down  he screams at me or he makes me feels bad of how strict or controlling i am so i dont say much.
Sex is lacking for months really theres no reason behind it as hes constantly tired .
He has s lot of female friends which i think it is a big red flag but i like some of them

After a successful first date where we shared 2 rounds of coffee and a great back-and-forth on listening/talking about each other, I'm going for another date with a guy that I matched with. 

First date was on Tuesday. He hasn't stopped texting me since. We're both eager to go out and meet each other again tomorrow. 

He's such a green flag so far; he's communicative, he tells me when he has classes (I'm a postgraduate; he finishing his legal qualification) but I asked him what kind of texter he was and we've been basically texting each other back and forth. He doesn't keep the convo flirty and will change the subject without making it seem like he's not un-interested to flirt. Amongst other things...

Anyways, so yeah, we're going out for some seafood lunch and shopping around. I don't know of should wear my white sneakers or a  pointed toe chunky high heel... üò≠üò≠üò≠

It‚Äôs not overly hard to find someone to spend the night with *that way*, and for advice friends who I have known for more than a decade are actually better as they‚Äôve known me far longer. Dating can be relatively expensive and more often than not doesn‚Äôt result in a relationship. I‚Äôm self sufficient and for emotional support family and friends are enough. So please, do tell me why I should date?","Sounds like you may be aromantic.  Don't date if you don't want, there's no law about it."
dating,145huj3,2023-06-09 21:46:56,Am I a bad person?,"So I had a gf (now ex) a few months back who wouldn‚Äôt do anything sexual with me. I told her I had a high sex drive but she just didn‚Äôt care. All she‚Äôd want to do is cuddle and this would make matter worse because I would get aroused and left with blue balls almost every time. Granted she did occasionally give in but it wasn‚Äôt enough. 

I felt like she didn‚Äôt want to do it with me or she simply just didn‚Äôt enjoy it. She would claim to love it but when I‚Äôd try to bring it up later it‚Äôs like her whole demeanor changed. She‚Äôd genuinely get upset if I even brought up anything sexual. It was so confusing and there were too many mixed signals. Throughout our relationship, I had contemplated leaving but the idea of anyone else having her made me sick so I stayed. 

Eventually, another girl I knew advanced on me and we ended up kissing.  She asked to rub on me and If I wanted to rub on her titties. I stupidly agreed and later felt guilty for what I did. We didn‚Äôt have sex but the fact that I had even entertained another girl whilst still with someone was against my morals. I told her and we had split for a while. We got back together but later ended up breaking up over something else. 

I never cheated before and I sure as hell don't plan on doing it again. Something in me just couldn't let her go even though wasn't happy. Am I a bad person or am I a person who just made a bad decision?",Nah shit happens. Just learn from it. Either way it sounds like you were not compatible with your ex so it's good yall broke up.

but I stay with her because I am scared of how much I could break her if I leave. But I feel I can't do this forever and I want to be with someone who I am in love with as much as they love me. 

So rn I don't know how to break up with her in a way that'll let her down easy","First of all, you are not obligated to stay with someone if you don‚Äôt want to BUT the grass is not greener on the other side. You say ‚Äúnot in love anymore‚Äù so you were once in love with her. What makes you think the same thing won‚Äôt happen again with a new person after a period of time? There is ways to reignite the spark. You do you man but if you really want to get out of the relationship you have to do it sooner rather than later. You will hurt her no matter what but it takes 2 to fight for a relationship so if you don‚Äôt want to then don‚Äôt. Leading her on is probably worse than getting it over with. Either way if you break up with her and later realize you miss her and that you do actually love her and have feelings for her, you can‚Äôt go crawling back."

So I wanted to get your thoughts on this. I have noticed that when I swipe right on dating apps or see a profile of Asian girls and their profile says something like message me something interesting, I do and then they block. Or if their profile says they want to meet people etc. I get really angry at times. Like why do they only go for white men or black. Why not a pakistani?

dating,145hhaj,2023-06-09 21:32:12,Is it possible to find a girl how I described in my post-breakup letter below?,"She was my bestest friend in the whole wide world, long before we even developed feelings for each other. We would talk every single day, for hours on end, and the conversation would never stop. In fact we would have to mutually agree to end the conversation, because there was no end to it.

&#x200B;

  
I would look at her and think ""It's like I have known you forever"". I knew through pure logic and not just emotion that she is very close to being my second half. The more we met, the more we wanted to, and needed to meet.   


&#x200B;

  
She was someone with whom I could be as silly, goofy, deep, weird, vulnerable, emotional etc as possible. Our conversations were literally split between us making silly noises, talking about serious topics and getting to know each other deeply. So deeply that we could answer any deep and random question about each other's life. She understood every word that came out of my mouth and instead of placing judgement, she would simply understand and reciprocate equally. We literally brought out the best in each other because we both provided each other a platform to express those parts of us. Our goofiness was unmatched, we would make funny noises together, we would make funny parodies on songs together, or even random improv based on anything around us or in the conversation. We would talk about the deepest topics of life; pros and cons of joint families, marriage, religion, spirituality, philosophy, why people do certain things, etc. She brought out every aspect of my personality out of me. And I did the same for her. 

&#x200B;

  
She matched me on almost every single thing. We had the same exact same humour, family values, moral values, relationship/marriage values, mindsets, goals, etc. We would write letters to each other in both English and Punjabi, letters expressing what we like about each other, and full of words with the intent to make each other filled with happiness. We would never allow each other to have self deprecating thoughts. A relationship built on pure quality time and words of affirmation, and there was no physical aspect to it. I saw in her the female version of myself.   


&#x200B;

  
Her personality was so endlessly deep and we knew each other so well that we would see each other in everything, everywhere. Everything and every place would make us think about each other. Maybe a random situation, an object, the environment around us - this was because we knew each other so well that we could see a part of each other in those things. For example, if I'm near a forest, I'd get reminded of her and how she loves hiking, if I see a circus, I'd get reminded of how goofy and funny she is, if I see a happy old couple, I'd get reminded of her maturity in relationships. She would do the same for me. She'd see something in her day, and if it reminded her of me, she would instantly message me. That is how close we were - we saw each other in all aspects of our lives.   


&#x200B;

  
A few of the things I really appreciated about her.   


&#x200B;

  
She made me feel so nostalgic. She reminded me of and mirrored every single stage of life I've been in. She and I had very similar experiences during the same life stages. Talking to her was literally like talking to myself while I was in those life stages. It was the most rare and surreal experience I've ever had in my life. A person who I never knew before, suddenly shows up in my life and I recognize in her, myself. Even simpler stuff like watching the same shows as me growing up, same YouTubers, similar interests, similar behaviours and habits, similar interactions with family members / friends / teachers, etc. We're even born in the same year.

&#x200B;

  
Her openness with me was more than she's been with anyone before. She would tell me stuff she has never told another soul, she would laugh at my jokes like she's never laughed before. She told me I brought out her truest and realest laugh that she had kept hidden for years. 

&#x200B;

  
Other than that, just as a short list of what I appreciated in her: the way she spoke with such love about her family, the amount of time she spent with her family, the way she would talk about her relationship with God, the fact that nothing could sway her from her morals and values ever, the way she would allow me to resurface my TRUE self, the way she gave me a platform for any thought I had, the way she was so nerdy and had all of these unique interests, the way she would speak about her desire to get married and have the happiest life with her future husband and in-laws, her modesty, her ability to make jokes on the spot and carry any joke that came her way, the way her joy and bubbly nature was simply contagious, they way she was nice to everybody out of the pureness of her heart, the way she appreciated her culture, language and religion, her perception of friendships, the fact that her personality was so wide and deep - I could start any conversation on any topic with her and the conversation would have no end to it. There are so many other things that I cannot think of right now. I am very glad that we got to spend the time we did together, and although it did not last forever, it has taught me that yes, there are people like her out there.

&#x200B;

  
Every person is rare and unique on this earth, but for me, she was the absolute most rarest person ever in this whole wide world. That is because I have never ever experienced such a strong emotional connection with any person in my life. My heart, mind and soul give the Universe a challenge: ""Universe, can you help me find another girl like her?"" And the Universe would probably respond ""Sorry that seems a bit impossible, but I'll try"". 

&#x200B;

  
I have moved on from her, and wish her all the best in her future relationship, and hope she is the happiest person ever. As for me, I hope my next relationship is with my final and life long love.

It‚Äôs always been talking stages or one sided situationships where I am always confused and I‚Äôm tired of the games and back and forth. I feel like I can get some attention but it always fades or materializes into anything more. 

And yes I have been to therapy and really worked on myself, gotten comfortable with being single and spending time by myself. I have a good job I‚Äôm thriving in and I do enjoy my own company but I‚Äôm tired of the loneliness especially when my friends are all having a lot of success.

Start dating as early as possible. That's my advice. I'm starting to date *at fucking 22 years old*. **I'm too fucking old**. I feel like shit. Full shit. I had a lot of troubles to ask a girl out, but I'm slowly overcoming them (GOOD!). Nonetheless, I feel jealous of those who started dating at 13, 14 or younger. They're way more experienced in dating and, well, they enjoyed the dating game earlier than me. That's why you have to start dating. 

As someone recently posted, the worst part of being single is no sex. Just because you're single doesn't mean you don't get horny, so‚Ä¶ if single you're fucked up, but you're having zero sex if you don't date. Zero intimacy, zero stories, zero anything.   
You'll have more experiences, more chances of finding the one (or ones) you want, more of the world. You'll fucking LIVE.   
Those are my lessons so far.","You're 22 not 52. Pick yourself up, dust yourself off, sort your attitude out and get on with it"

dating,145gyib,2023-06-09 21:11:33,Anyone else feel like they have a perfectly amazing life minus the fact that they've had little to no success with romance?,"The effect that this seems to have is that it creates great polarity in my mood and confidence. Maybe this seems relatable?

I'm 25 and have never had a girlfriend. I've only recently come to realize that my strategy of just focusing on myself and waiting for Ms. Perfect to come along and throw herself at me is not viable. I know it seems pretty late in the game for me to only recently have come to terms with that. Now I've realized that I need to actually ask girls out when I'm attracted to them. I understand that a huge component of getting a girl attracted to you initially is confidence.

I am always working on maintaining a consistent level of confidence, making sure that I come off as strong and centered (as Coach Corey Wayne might say) and demonstrating that no matter what happens, I will be okay. 

On the one hand, I feel immensely confident in myself because I have a great life. I am in grad school on a full ride scholarship, have above average grades, and I'm relatively thin, but with noticeable bicep muscles. 

However, I have to constantly try to keep my confidence afloat when considering my lack of success with romance in the past. I try not to dwell on it, but every once in awhile it just happens. Based on how successful I am in almost all areas of my life, I feel confident that I can attract a great girl to be with, but then I also consider that I have never done so before, and it throws some doubt into the equation. Anyone else in this same boat?

I guess it's best to just remember that ""It always seems impossible until it's done"" as Nelson Mandela said.","It is common advice here that one needs to learn to live on their own before they're ready to live with someone else, that they need to love themselves and be comfortable with themselves first etc etc. And I don't disagree! But...  


I'm pretty happy with my life, I live in a fresh apartment in a beautiful town in Sweden with nature nearby, good friends, a good career on the way, a supportive family, my health is good and improving, but when I found myself in a relationship after years on my own it was like something irreplacable came into place. And when that relationship ended up not working out after some time I found myself alone again, and now I can't help but feel like even if everything else works out perfectly, I will just live 50% of a life if I'm on my own... :(  


Maybe for some people romantic relationships are just one good thing among many, interchangeable with other things. But I can't feel that way. Sadly, I also feel that the loneliness also ratchets up desperation and bitterness in a way that is not very healthy for me and not attractive to others."
dating,145gsin,2023-06-09 21:04:58,I was wrong about women,"I'm a 23M and I've never had a girlfriend, I don't consider myself ugly, but I'm quite an introvert and that's why I had assimilated that I will never have a girlfriend (but because I always thought that women never start a conversation). However, right now I'm volunteering in a hostel and I work with a guy about my age who is a tall, thin, Brazilian model, the fact is that I realized something, when I'm in a common room, me and another girl (a guest from the hostel) they never speak to me (or look at me, it is as if they avoid my gaze), and many times they don't even respond when I enter the room and say ‚Äúhi‚Äù, however, when my coworker is alone in the room, the girls in the room start talking to him and it's as if their face light up when they saw him.

In short, I was always wrong with women, it's not that they never start a conversation, it's that I'm ugly.

Edit: So this is why I decided to write this post, similar things have happened but today was blatant. My coworker friend and I were on a sofa talking, and there was another girl with a laptop in the same room, she didn't say a word. I got up to go shower and just walk out the door and when I close it, I start to hear the girl saying ""Hi, what's your name, where are you from?"" When I finished taking a shower, I went back to the room where they were both and shortly after my friend left the room to make a call, it was exactly the same situation, she and another person alone in the room, she didn't say a word to me (I wasn‚Äôt even looking at my phone, exactly because I wanted to force to see if it was just my imagination or is it because I look not interested because I use my phone), she didn‚Äôt even rise her head from the laptop, my friend came back from making the call, and after a while the girl got up to leave, she said ""see you"" with a big smile to my friend, I was on the sofa sitting next to him looking at her, she didn't even look at me when saying goodbye.","Idk if you're rly ugly, but it's likely that you're socially awkward and act all anxious and weird around women.

dating,145fbls,2023-06-09 20:06:51,I haven‚Äôt felt like this in a while. Please read.,"There‚Äôs this girl (24f) I‚Äôm (29m) sort of crushing on (both in same college) because I felt like she was/is showing interest in me. She‚Äôs way out of my league and I‚Äôm sure she has many options, but it seems she is quite nice with me which is a bit rare I feel. I compare with the friendships I have with other girls. I just don‚Äôt want to confuse kindness with interest so its really difficult. Long story short, I get butterflies and can‚Äôt stop thinking about this. Been a while since I dated.

- She likes my instagram stories and occasionally commented on them
- she sends me voice messages, asks me how i was feeling when I was sick (again I feel like this might be her kindness) - but she calls or sends voice messages/texts.
- She faces me when we talk, plays with her hair, smiles, and doesn‚Äôt look at the phone too often.
- she has asked me if I‚Äôm coming to an event where she‚Äôll be at. She‚Äôs invited me 2 times over to her place to talk before going out to the club. One time by myself, the other with another dude who‚Äôs a friend. She‚Äôs excited to go to these events it seems, but she could also be the same with others.
- she‚Äôs told her mom about me
- her voice/pitch gets high and cute before she says bye to me on the phone. 
- we always ‚Äúfight‚Äù over the bill and she has always offered to pay, but I usually get it (this is a cultural thing though). But she could also not offer if she wasn‚Äôt interested despite our culture/traditions?
- in our culture, we are too nice and sometimes this can be perceived incorrectly - that‚Äôs why I can‚Äôt tell. We are both from the same country, but I was born and raised in America so my perception is skewed if that makes sense.
- I‚Äôve told her I like spending time with her and would like to get to know her better and she said she feels the same, she hugged me and said that we‚Äôd talk about it soon. But luckily, that wasn‚Äôt the end of it. She doesn‚Äôt ignore me. We just haven‚Äôt talked about it yet. What could this mean? 
- after I told her that, she came to have coffee with me and we ended up talking for 2 hours until the coffee shop closed. Before the coffee ‚Äúdate‚Äù she kept saying she wanted to go home to finish doing her chores before I told her I wanted to get to know her better, but seemed to have a change of mind after I said I was interested. So she made time to spend with me.
- I didn‚Äôt say the word ‚Äúdate‚Äù so I felt like it was implied. I asked her out to have lunch with me, she said yes, I also asked her to walk with me, and she also said yes (but seemed like she also had some shopping to do for a friend so we did that together). We‚Äôve done a decent amount of things over the past 2 weeks since I moved to this city. I‚Äôm a very quiet and shy person and my emotions/anxiety seem to take over sometimes so I barely talk or get flirty. She‚Äôs usually the one keeping the convo going and I actively listen and follow through based off surroundings and what she‚Äôs saying. Never seen a girl more beautiful so I get tongue tied and lost for words sometimes too.
- 
- she seems to say yes to everything I ask even though she has plans, she tries to coordinate so that she can hang with me too.

My only issue is that there might be another guy she‚Äôs seeing, but I don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôre together. I‚Äôm too afraid to ask. He‚Äôs good looking while I think I‚Äôm average so I feel intimidated. He has a car, I don‚Äôt because I just moved to a new city. He can take her places, etc. 

I asked her to come meet me today because I had a surprise for her. She had plans, but squeezed me in. She even tried to change the timing of her other plan so she can come to mine. She told me a while ago that she wanted to be in a certain professors class in uni. That certain Professor invited me somewhere for a college-run event and I‚Äôm taking her to meet her so she can network, etc. after that, we‚Äôre heading to a rave. 

TLDR: Sorry if this was long. I‚Äôm just basically saying she‚Äôs showing signs of interest in me, and I‚Äôm intimated by this guy she may or may not be seeing. I never ask her if she‚Äôs seeing someone, because I feel weird about it. I like to make subtle moves and play the long game so I can get to know a person. I don‚Äôt like mind games, manipulation, and touchy flirtation because I respect her boundaries. I also don‚Äôt want to intrude on her private life. 

I don‚Äôt believe in friend zone because I believe you have to be a friend to a girl first before you start dating. You just have to make the right moves and not take too long, otherwise you‚Äôll lose your chance. 

Having said that, what do you think my next move should be? 

Grateful for your time and help.
Please go easy on me. I‚Äôm not afraid to say I‚Äôm a bit fragile/vulnerable and stressed at the moment. I‚Äôm overthinking this and need advice on how and what to do rather than what position I‚Äôm in right now with her.","I‚Äôd say just ask her straight up, you can ask her in a way that doesn‚Äôt reveal your interest though if that‚Äôs why you are nervous about asking."

Been broken up with by possibly the love of my life after only a 6 months relationship (I know I should be over it). Then started seeing someone else and started moving on but then she also ended things with me.  
After this me and my ex had been meeting up and I really thought it was going somewhere. But it didnt and she recently told me she was in a new relationship after not speaking to me for about 3 months.   
I have been on dating apps and they are just not working for me. Unfortunately they are the only way I get laid. I am defintely not an ugly guy, I work out and take care of myself.   
But I lack a lot of self confidence and I find it incredibly difficult to approach women I find attractive. I do not lack the social skills and I am actually very good at talking to women. 

Another huge problem is I dont have a social circle and its really starting to get to me. I have friends but not a group to hang out with.

dating,145f8mo,2023-06-09 20:03:34,I feel so lonely even though I usually enjoy being alone,"I am a 22F in my third year on Uni (molecual biology major), soon approaching my 4th year. I live in a dorm with my high school friend who I've known for 11 years now. She is asexual I am bisexual. I dare to say she is more anxious person than me because I have been trying really hard to work on my anxiety while she just tries to avoid it as much as possible. I love her I try to help her as much as I can but I can't say she is able to do the same for me which is something I accept given her issues. What I really liked was that I could talk to her about everything but I can't tell her about this.

A year ago she was approached by a boy during a field trip and they started dating. She's been with him for a year now and they meet up like once a week. I don't mind her talking to me about him because she is my friend and I always try to be here for her. But whenever she talks about him my heart hurts. We have two more friends from High school, one got boyfriend since her 1st year on Uni and the other one now went on a few dates with a boy her mom matched her with a few weeks ago. All of them talking about these experiences together is something that just hurts me so much and I can't talk to anybody about this pain. My grand-aunt and my mother keep telling me to find someone too and the more I hear anyone talking to be about relationships I hurt so much. I mean I can feel my heart and my soul physically hurting and I just want to hide somewhere and cry. 

I am from a family where I had to learn to count on myself very early on. I was emotionally and mentally abused for years. Being alone was something I got used to very quickly and most of the times I prefer to be alone because I can do things I like without anyone judging me or telling me that I like stupid things.

But lately being alone always makes me fall into these feelings of loneliness. It makes me feel like I am missing out on my young years. I was dating a girl during my 2nd year on Uni and I broke up with her after a month because she is asexual and I just need more physical closeness than she would be comfortable with. I tried tinder but I have a few very important things I need in a person and I can't seem to find that person. One more problem is that I am a virgin and when I finally feel like I could click with someone they just want to rush into sex and I can't really provide that yet. I mean I am open to try things and get closer but I need time to actually get comfortable with that person so sex after only meeting 2 times is really not for me. Tbh because of many guys I met on tinder I am starting to feel ashamed of being a virgin but I just want to meet someone who is more special for me not just a one-night-stand.

I just got a part-time job in a lab for this summer and if my training goes well they want to keep me there during the semester as well. It was hard to approach the lab and go for an interview because my anxiety just always acts up but I made it and I am really happy I did. I have to start working on my bachleor's thesis that I have been putting off for a long time now because I'm really worried to start as I hate making mistakes but I know I have to start and I really want to work on myself. I am very self-aware person but these feelings about loneliness are something I just have hard times understanding because as I said I usually don't mind being on my own but lately it has really been painful.",
dating,145f2q7,2023-06-09 19:56:56,"lies, trust, and long-distance","My boyfriend of two years spends a lot of time working in another state (3 weeks a month or so). He keeps saying that he will catch up financially and do that less (it's a business with his brother). The distance has created a lot of tension in our relationship partially because I moved where I currently live for him and don't really want a long distance relationship. 

About 6 months ago we had a major break down in communication because I wasn't comfortable with a male friend of his moving in. We only have one bathroom and he is gone so much. At that time he told many little lies because I think he didn't want anyone to be unhappy. But it left me looking like a really bad person and feeling unheard. Many of the lies at that time were also about silly things. One day he was gone all day and told me he was at the bowling alley which was closed and also a park that is closed for the winter. 

Since winter he has become more worried about money and gone more. I think we have been around each other about 3 weeks in 4 months. On my birthday, I found out that he started pursuing a woman in the state that he works. I saw a message because he often lets me use his phone for things. He had made plans to cook her dinner when he got back and also seemed to be giving love eyes emojis to all of her social media posts. I asked him about it and he said she was a friend and making a website for their business. I asked her and she seemed to be surprised because he had told her that he recently broke up with a girlfriend and that the intent had been clear to her that they were pursuing a romantic relationship. 

I feel extremely hurt of course and have been through this before. But he also told me he wants to work it out. 

It is extremely complicated because I had thought this was a pretty serious relationship and I live in his house. It is an old house and I am more handy than my bf so have done significant renovations and even spent a lot of my own money. I also pay him rent. Since I didn't want to be in this state in the first place, I would move to another state if it is really over. 

Sorry for such a long winded explanation on the way to a question. He wants to work it out and he also wants me to continue to upkeep the house and run Airbnb. I agreed because we have an arrangement that would allow me to recoup funds for some of my investment in the house. We decided it was most healthy to put the relationship on a break so we can both figure out what we want (the break was my idea because with the lack of trust, I can't imagine phone communication that doesn't go negative). But given that my trust is so broken and he is gone so much of the time, is there any hope to repair this? 

I think figuring out some answer to this question is important to me because given that he owns the house, it would probably make sense for me to keep my word on the arrangement (airbnb, etc) but begin to move my things to a storage unit so that my exit is easier when it is ultimately necessary. Otherwise, I could hold tight, upkeep the house/business and wait and see. But this is all pretty anxious for me because when there have been big fights he threatens to put my stuff on the curb and/or lock me out and I wouldn't have much recourse since the house is indeed his and we don't have a formal landlord/tenant agreement or signed document.",
dating,145etlb,2023-06-09 19:46:16,To what extent should you change for love ?,"Hi everyone, I (20M) have been dating a girl (20) for 15 months now and she recently revealed to me things that I find hard to accept... I don¬¥t really know if I need advice or support but I felt the urge to write it. 

I apologize in advance for my english, I¬¥m not a native speaker.

To give you a bit of context, most of our relationship is good. My feelings for her are very strong. 

Since we got together, she's been making regular ""suggestions"" or demands, for example she used to regularly point out the fact that she would like me to come to the gym with her, that my body was good but she¬¥d prefer me¬†more¬†muscled. When she undestood that these demands made me feel quite insecure, she stopped asking. However, now that I know what she desires I can't really take it out of my head and I still feel insecure about my body with her. She's also been asking me to change how I dress, or to cut my hair more regularly, saying these things would help her be more attracted to me. These remarks really started to make me wonder why she would be dating me if she doesn't like the way I dress or my body‚Ä¶ Of course, I now feel kind of insecure about the way I look. 

Also, we very rarely make love (once a month or even less). To be honest, I would have liked us to do it more but I¬¥ve never really talked about it to her because I feel like telling this to her might ""force"" her to do things with me more than she would like to, and I would never do that to her. Basically, I thought she just didn¬¥t like sex very much and I could live with it since I love her and thought that sex was not as important as the rest of our relationship. 

Yesterday we¬¥ve had a big deep talk about our relationship and I felt like it was a good time to talk about it, not really to put pressure on her but I wanted to know if my assumption was true... She answered to me that she really has the best times of her life with me but she doesn't really desire me in a sexual way (or rarely). Later in the discussion, she told me that she used to make love very often (~1 a day) with one of her previous boyfriends and this really hurt me (even though I'm usualy not easilly hurt). These two informations combined really made me feel like a piece of sh*t. I felt like I was not satisfying her enough, otherwise we would do it more often. Also, I I can't help to compare me to her previous boyfriend, even though she tells me sex with me is better than with him (I find it difficult to believe her about that)...

When I asked her why she doesn't desire me as much as she used to desire him, she answered that they has a long distance relationship so the desire was strong when they saw each other, and then she brang back again the remarks about my way to dress and my body, telling me she would have dreamed about dating a gym boy but still likes the way I look. This answer felt so bad I wanted to throw up and later I couldn't really sleep, this really made me question why she would be with me if she doesn't find me attractive. She also said again that changing these things might help turning her on but for now I feel so bad about these revelations I'm kind of paralysed, I'm desperate she doens't like me the way I am and don¬¥t really know if trying to make these changes would be the good thing to do :(","she doesn't sound like a very good person. if she wants someone/something else, she should go find it. trying to change other people to suit your needs, especially physically, is a terrible idea.

>dreamed about dating a gym boy

ouch.

what i've found with these people, is it's never enough. she sounds immature (how old are you both??) and just generally an asshole. you don't need to change. :)

I originally bought it to overcome porn-induced ED and death grip, as it was seriously affecting my sex life.

I pretty much bought it to re-train my body to actually be aroused by physical sexual activity, and not just stuff on a screen. Tldr, it worked amazingly well.

However, I'm now ready to start dating again, and I'm kinda worried about what any potential partners will think when they inevitably find out at some point.

I know sex toys are very common these days, however owning a vibrator or fleshlight is one thing, but... I'm talking about a whole-ass.... Well, ass.

dating,145e7e6,2023-06-09 19:21:27,How I almost met my mother in law,"This is how my relationship with my future wife developed and what I‚Äôd call our real first date.

&#x200B;

I met her around Christmas of junior year when I went out with her roommate. They didn‚Äôt get along well so if I was going over she was never there. I still remember the first time I saw her though. I was hanging around her floor and she was walking by to go to the bathroom before bed to brush her teeth. She had on a red union suit with a trap door and the guy I was with yelled ‚ÄúDoes the trap door work‚Äù. She pulled it down for ¬Ω a second and it was so innocent yet sexy I was hooked.

&#x200B;

I thought she was attractive and talented but she was supposedly ‚ÄúPre engaged‚Äù to her high school boyfriend who was at Cornell.  Also academically she was a mess. She didn‚Äôt get along with her mother and chose RIT because it was the furthest college away from her parents with an art program. Her major was Environmental Design which she chose because she hated it the least. By the middle of junior year she was already almost a year behind in her major mostly because she didn‚Äôt go to class. But what was obvious was she was an incredibly talented artist. She drew almost constantly. Every night a bunch of our friends  would meet at the dining hall and she always had her Rapidograph with her and she would draw on the trays and take requests and people might not know her but everybody recognized her trays and they were a big hit.

&#x200B;

So we hung around more and more and by the end of junior year we were really close to being a couple but when school ended I was going to stay at school to be a teaching assistant and she was going home which she wasn‚Äôt looking forward to. That summer I was a TA I was in charge of opening the darkrooms and then I sat in this windowless room with this guy Bruce and students would bring their prints out for advice. Mostly Bruce and I just talked. We weren‚Äôt friends at the beginning but if you‚Äôre stuck in a small room with someone you have to find something to talk about and we became friends. 

&#x200B;

That summer I had a Volvo 144 which was a fun car but  it needed new brakes and carbuerators and stupidly I thought I could do the work myself. The car sat on blocks almost the whole summer, undriveable. Most days when I was bored watching the darkrooms I‚Äôd write her a letter, make her a collage or do anything I could do to impress her. I wasn‚Äôt trying to but I‚Äôm sure her mother saw everything I sent and now realized I was a threat to her plans for Bethany. I don‚Äôt remember how but we made arrangements to get together and go to NYC for the night. My best friend at the time Dave was working at a newspaper in Northern New Jersey so the plan was that I‚Äôd hitchhike to New Jersey, he‚Äôd pick me up and we‚Äôd go and pick up a girl he was interested in who wasn‚Äôt too far from Bethany‚Äôs house.

&#x200B;

So I started hitchhiking early one Saturday and I only remember one ride on the way down and one on the way back. On the way down I had every male hitchhiker‚Äôs fantasy, An attractive horny girl picked me up. I didn‚Äôt hitchhike a lot but I think I only got picked up by women once or twice. She was driving a convertible and wearing about the shortest cut off shorts you could imagine. She kept telling me how attractive I was and I‚Äôm no angel but I was already behind schedule so I just kept telling her I was going to see my girlfriend. Eventually she gave up and told me my girlfriend was really lucky and she started flashing any truckers that went by. She dropped me off and I never got picked up by a horny woman again.

&#x200B;

I got to New Jersey late, Dave picked me up and we headed towards Westchester where Bethany and the other girl lived. When we got to Bethany‚Äôs house I was all set to meet her parents but as soon as she heard our car she came running out. It was dusk so I think it was 9 o‚Äôclock by then. Halfway to the city I said that I was surprised her parents were letting her go to the city. She said she had just told them we were going to a local bar. That wasn‚Äôt encouraging but I was so glad to see her I didn‚Äôt say anything.. We got a parking space right in the middle of Greenwich Village and we decided we‚Äôd meet back at the car at 1. Then it was a really sweet date, we walked around Greenwich Village, Little Italy is right next to the Village and there was a feast to a Saint and they had rides set up and I remember we went on the Ferris wheel.We held hands but we never even kissed. At 1 we met Dave and his date back at the car and headed back to Westchester.

&#x200B;

 It was during one of the late 70‚Äôs gas crises, OPEC had cut back production and there were lines at every gas station. Every station we tried to stop at had a line of at least 50 cars even though it was 1:30 in the morning. The further we got away from NYC the more remote it got and we didn‚Äôt see any gas stations so when we pulled into her driveway it was 4am. Dave‚Äôs car was running on fumes and Bethany said her Dad would have gas for his lawnmower. As soon as she started to open the garage door all the lights went on in the house and her mother started screaming, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe it, I can‚Äôt believe it‚Äù. The 3 of us looked at each other and decided leaving as fast as we could was the best choice so Dave and I took off and left Bethany to deal with her mother. We finally ran out of gas 50 yards from a gas station and pushed the car to the pumps and fell asleep. When the station opened they woke us up and gave us gas. Dave had to work for the newspaper so he dropped me off at the Thruway and I started to hitchhike back to Rochester.

&#x200B;

I only remember 1 ride on the way back. A guy picked me up and the sun was warm and I was asleep in 5 minutes. I don‚Äôt know how long I slept but I woke up and something seemed different. There were all these porno magazines spread out and if you‚Äôre not expecting porn it takes a while to understand what you‚Äôre looking at. So I‚Äôm looking at these pictures and saying ‚ÄúWell that‚Äôs a penis and there‚Äôs another one‚Äù. I kept looking for girls but I realized  it was gay porn so I sat up straight. The guy was cool and invited me to his house but I said I had to get back to Rochester. If you were a young guy hitchhiking you always got picked up by gay guys but I never had any problems. It‚Äôs hard to imagine now but in 1979 you had to work to find porn, now you have to work to avoid it. The standard pickup line by these guys was ‚ÄúSo what do you think of those porno films‚Äù. They were just pathetic and lame.

&#x200B;

So somehow I made it to Rochester and the Thruway entrance is about 7 miles from RIT. I had barely started walking and a good friend drove by, looked at me,  and didn‚Äôt stop. I saw him the next day and he said ‚ÄúI thought that was you‚Äù. So I walked the 7 miles to campus and I was exhausted but excited because I finally felt like I had a girlfriend.We finally became a couple in October and soon after things with  her parents got even worse if you can imagine.",

We most likely wont meet for the next three months because Im abroad. Moreover, we also most likely wont be meeting very often even when Im gonna be back, because I will start studying in a completly different town, that is pretty far away.

Personally I think that its completly possible, but I wanted to hear whether other people have similiar stories and how they ended.",Yes it definitely can work when both people are mature and determined to be with one another.

So basically she's 23 and she's seeing a girl who is 20. They have been seeing each other since December and started having sexual relations in March. 23 year old wants to date her but doesn't want to ask her. 20 year old is not doing anything I guess, but has voiced concerns over the 23 year old not asking her out. I basically told my friend that she should ask because they are at a point where they are having sex and going on dates but not having a label? And clearly both people are getting hurt at the lack of commitment.

I love her but it's also kind of lame that she is seeing this girl without asking her out, like it kind of feels like she's just using her but is scared to commit. She's not going to listen to me but I wanted to hear everyone's thoughts on situationships because it honestly bothers me lol and it's been a point of debate among my friends recently. But yeah this is all just out of good fun and curiosity, obviously at the end of the day my friend is just going to do her thing lol

Also how long is too long do you think to ask someone out?",

dating,145d1fe,2023-06-09 18:35:02,A guy (35M) that I(29F) went out with is best friends with his ex,"I (29F) started dating this guy(35M) recently, and although I ended things I wanted to get some thoughts on the issues we had because he saw nothing wrong with it.   
He's best friends with his ex girlfriend. They talk almost every day or just send memes back & forth on IG, they regularly go out to dinner each week and because he bought a puppy during the relationship and she helped raise it, she still has keys to his place and is over frequently. She'll even take him home to her house during his longer work shifts. He told me they were friends with benefits for 2 years and then had a tumultuous on again/off again relationship for 2 years after that. The last 6 months they've been broken up, haven't had sex but they have kept up appearances, i.e his family doesn't know they broke up, neither do his friends except maybe his twin brother. He said he loves her but didn't want to be in a relationship with her but also can't stand losing her. He also said she's the most important friend of his. Apparently they had issues because he couldn't accept the boundaries she placed on him constantly staying in contact with past hook ups via social media and it made her ""nagging and annoying"". He checks in with me regularly asking how my day is going and stuff but doesn't do that with her.  She tried leaving him and cutting contact but he kept pushing to stay in her life and now they're doing this.   
I'd love to head some thoughts on this because he doesn't see anything wrong with what he's doing or the way their relationship is but I disagree.  
TLDR; This guy hangs out with his ex every week, she still has keys to his house to help with his dog, either talks to or sends memes back and forth every day. He says he broke up with her but she is his best friend and he doesn't want to lose her even though she has tried cutting contact.",Friends would be one thing but this guy is still in a relationship with her.

I have been talking to this girl for around 2.5 months. We met off of Hinge and it seems like we have really hit it off.

We have been texting nearly every day. When I don‚Äôt text first I find that she is texting me asking how my day is going. The texts normally are just asking how each other is doing or getting to know each other.

Since we have started talking we have gone out 2 times and have plans on a third. We already have had conversations about previous relationships and what we are looking for in partners. We haven‚Äôt kissed or done anything else other than hug (because I didn‚Äôt want to come off as too aggressive).

I developed a crush on him as one does when they get close to one another. There was only one problem. A really close friend of mine also had a crush on the same guy. She knew about my feelings for him, but the next thing I know, they started dating. There was definitely a sense of betrayal that went away quickly in fear of losing both of my friends and so, I tried to smother my feelings. Make them disappear. When people tell you that feelings don't just go away, they aren't wrong. And so I had to distance myself. Me and my crush lost our close relationship out of respect for my friend. Now this relationship recently ended due to personal reasons after a year and a half long relationship. They are both in the same friend group, so it feels a little awkward. Everyone in the friend group is comforting my friend (F) but nobody really thinks to comfort the guy. And so, me thinking my feelings had finally subsided, I chose to be the one he could confide in. We've gotten super close recently, texting, late night calls, having conversations we both enjoy, and my feelings have decided to make a comeback. I'm not sure how he feels about me and so I asked my older sister. She told me that no man would stay up late to talk to me, especially when he had to wake up early the next morning for work unless he liked me. So now my hopes are high but I feel like a horrible person for liking my friend's ex and wanting to pursue a relationship with him. Am I a bad person? What should I do in this situation?",You‚Äôre not horrible. Date whoever makes you happy. And if she‚Äôs really your friend she just wants to see you happy

dating,145cdv4,2023-06-09 18:08:51,Don't know what I'm doing wrong,"I (30M) am recently trying dating online and IRL. And to be honest it has been somewhat frustrating for multiple reasons.

I am 6 ft tall, I am somewhat handsome, I have a good paying job. I have a car and knowledge of all the good places in my city. I also know how to use the bus. I am about to buy a house. I would like to get married and have kids. I am ambivert. Mostly related to the geek side of things. I have ease of speech and have spoken several times in events and reunions so I am pretty confident. I dress as cleanly as possible and my personal hygiene is good.

I got impeccable reputation from work and other places, people keep constantly saying I'm a good man in most places.

I'm looking for something serious. As in a relationship that can end in marriage. (With several years of travel and fun things before of course, I clarify that I am not a completely trad guy but I stick to that role as much as I can, I am flexibl).

Here's my experience in those two settings:

1: OLD

Basically I am that wierd guy that ACTUALLY gets matches from girls (tinder, bumble) (more than 10 per month or so) but those matches basically mean nothing. Generally I get a good conversation out of most girls but when I ask them out to actually talk they start ghosting me. It's just a plain waste of time most cases.

The only times I've actually went out with two out of all my matches the girls were really boring.... They didn't wanna share a lot of details about them and were basically the stereotype of girl who only wanted a free meal. Super bad.


2: Physical places

I attend mostly cosplay events geek stuff of all kinds. Almost every girl I hang around has a boyfriend (objectively speaking because I am NOT looking for someone who's indecisive of it's partner and doesn't want to end the relationship before getting into another) so they are strictly in all sense of the word FRIENDS or ACQUAINTANCES (multiple cases). Getting that out of the way there were a few girls that are single that I've invited to hang out and chat...

Another place I've tried to look for is in the (most recent) workplace, and here LITERALLY all girls have a boyfriend with relationships that have lasted up to 6 years, some 3 years some around that number (which I don't particularly would like... If I'm lasting that long I'd be commiting btw).

And I do shooting sports in my country which is really hard compared to doing in it in a country like the USA but usually old men hang in there. No girls at all.

I also go to the gym but I have the same problem as in the workplace. Everyone is taken. Actually the 100% of girls.

My two most recent cases were: 

1.- I talked a lot with this girl at the cosplay events and at a friend's house. She said that she would love to hang out and find out more about me. So I invited her over (for 3 weeks, messaged her once a week telling her if she wanted to hang out to different places) and she always had an excuse. 

(Those being: I have a cold, I am attending to a church event, my aunt's birthday) 

I didn't quite believed it but I gave her the benefit of the doubt. After those 3 times I stopped asking her and told her to call me when she had time.

2.- Another girl I met at my previous workplace. We've been messaging quite a while but she seems too, to always puts up an excuse similarity to the other girl (again, my policy is that usually I stop asking after 3 times tops) This girl has put up an excuse two times already saying ""I'll come if I end up this other business first"" that business being another thing she had with her friends.

The thing is that they seem to have interest but when they're home they lose it (what I'm perceiving is mostly lazyness and a lack of interest).

Is there anyway I can change this streak of luck? I really hate talking to a girl, saying I want to get to know her more (literally opening my feelings which feels shameful and makes me feel vulnerable every time) and then getting excuses for the reasons they can't or being downright ghosted.


What am I doing wrong? What can I change?",

anyways i‚Äôve never dated anyone for this long and i‚Äôve never broken up with anyone so i‚Äôm just wondering what basic breakup protocols are? like i don‚Äôt want to completely shit on him but idk? and should i do it in public or would a private space be better?","Clear, concise, and firm.

I save it for in person conversations. Keeps it from getting boring too fast.

dating,145aae4,2023-06-09 16:46:26,Friend Zoning,"This is insight and guiding support from a dad who has been an addict, is ADHD and somewhere ""on the spectrum"", who has found and lost ""love"" and discovered that I have to love myself first before I can love, and truly appreciate, anybody else.
This reflection is about needing to allow ourselves to appreciate every emotion b/c every emotion WILL help us be the best is imaginable. 
Just imagine if all the people could express their appreciation of emoting...

About kindred spirits, 
You two have so much in common that your positive and negative traits are ""apples to apples"". ""Friend-zoning"" Is for emotional security, which is a quality you want for ""oneness"".
You both may be aware at some level of consciousness that you will both bring out the best, and worst, of each other, in addition to needing to keep some emotional distance between you in order to maintain a lasting, in-person, connection. 
To its benefit, this long standing friendship will keep you in each other's proximity and allow each of you to work through any self-loathing attributes/addictions and be there for one another. 
Unfortunately, you have to exercise patience for the long-term reward of ""oneness"" (at least that is the story of you two I've made up in my head). This may also mean you and he take other partners over the years. Depending on how you look at it you two will always be there to pick the other up after being crushed by ""love"", which is really each of you not getting what you really need from those relationships, namely, the other. 
Love is found in patience which is found in having patience in oneself. Learn to love you and if he can do the same you will find bliss in each other's arms. 

If time was fair we could gaze upon our lives from birth to death and experience the minutia of every emotion to KNOW what the right choices are and to experience as much good for as long as possible. But we are but an imperfect reflection of God (or whatever) and have to feel every feeling in real-time.

Beauty is subjective, so the 'everyday' man is folks who aren't Brad Pitt, and could be labeled ugly or unattractive, whether they truly are ugly or just middling. I'll preface this with saying I met the loml through an app called Wizz (yes I know it's technically not a dating app, and yes I am rather young lol). Sadly, she left me. All-in-all, you'd have to possess a degradation kink. You genuinely are subjecting yourself to bullying. Its sad because I have balls of steel, but I've seen it be done to others as well and they do not take it so lightly. Besides the name-calling and other things of the likes, you can just see by the numbers released by platforms, men open these apps to nothing, if not the responses to their pleas for attention with scalding rejections.

He asked to see me again, for a date. I was excited and happily agreed. I noticed he hadn‚Äôt logged into grindr in 17 hours, and I wasn‚Äôt really chatting with anyone so I deleted mine. It obviously jumped the gun but I didn‚Äôt want this guy to think I was looking around after what was a really rare special night (at least for me) 

The week between that night and our second date, we were texting every day T least once a day, and he initiated a lot of the conversation. He said that he‚Äôs excited to see me etc and I said as much too. 

Our second date seemed to go very well. We spent all day together and after the date he thanked me for another amazing day. He told me he‚Äôd be very busy the next week, work wise. 

So basically this past week I haven‚Äôt really been hearing a lot from him. I have initiated a few times and he does reply. The other night I just called him and he answered and we chatted a bit, he seemed happy to talk but said that this weekend he wants to just relax but we should plan something again for the following weekend. 

I know this sounds entirely normal, but since our last date, I have been sort of uneasy and anxious. I kind of feel like there‚Äôs a bit of a difference in the energy he is giving me. 

I must point out that I have dated many guys and I haven‚Äôt felt this kind of intensity before, maybe because we had great sex right away and then connected emotionally a bit‚Ä¶i am unexpectedly smitten. 

Today is Friday, I am tempted to just not initiate conversation all weekend and see what happens. 

Another part of me just wants to ask him where he stands, so I can move on and stop being so hung up on him. 

I want to reinstall grindr (well not really but I feel like I should keep my options open) but I‚Äôm afraid that if I see him actively on it. 

I hate having to play these games of seeming cool, but a part of me doesn‚Äôt want to show my hand so early. 

What should I do? Just tell him I want to be more serious, ask him if he really still wants to see me or just not say anything?

dating,1458lwe,2023-06-09 15:41:31,"Women, do you ever regret losing someone who was good to you?","I know there is already a questions similar to this directed towards men. However, I was hoping for a women's perspective given that there tends to be differences. I like to think I was good to my ex partner. I truly wanted nothing but the best for them and I supported them no matter what. But, after going to therapy, I realized they had things they needed to work on and it was never going to work if we continued along that path. She ended up breaking up with me after saying she didn't want to date anyone soon. We haven't talked in over a year and she has not once reached out. I just find it jarring how you can share a life with someone and then never speak again. 

I've been tempted to reach out to her to see if anything changed. I know I've certainly grown as a person over time. If she wanted to I don't think she would reach out because that means being vulnerable, which I know is a struggle for her.","Your situation is really similar to something I experienced, so here‚Äôs my perspective as the woman:

You might not have been as good to your ex as you think you were. She wasn‚Äôt perfect either, she knows this. You both had the best intentions, but fell short in some way that prevented both of you from living your best lives together. Sometimes people are just incompatible, be it due to different needs, lifestyles, etc. 

If the relationship ended on a sour note, she may hold some resentment toward you for so many years of sharing a life together that failed‚Äîultimately, it feels wasted. Like you committed some injustice to her. It doesn‚Äôt feel fair to you because you know you tried your best, but at this point, nothing you do will redeem you. The damage is done. That‚Äôs why she doesn‚Äôt reach out, she is too focused on moving on, making up for those wasted years. She doesn‚Äôt want to either a) appear weak to you, or b) regress back into a relationship that was bad for her. She‚Äôs doing what she can to be better without you. You should do the same. Take all the growth you‚Äôve made and commit it to a partner who is better for you.

Maybe I‚Äôm wrong. Without the full story I can‚Äôt say for sure what‚Äôs going through her mind, even then, it‚Äôs still speculation. This is just how I felt in that same situation. But I wish you all the best and hope you find someone who appreciates your efforts!"
dating,1458j0j,2023-06-09 15:38:23,I (27m) had an awkward hookup with a girl (28f). Wondering how I could have been handled better.,"

This girl and I had been on 4 dates and everything was going well. We really enjoyed each others company and she told me she felt happy and relaxed around me, and I felt the same about her. 

At the end of our 4th date we start to hookup for the first time (we had only had brief kisses the previous two dates). A few minutes into the kissing she starts to critique my kissing. She does it by asking ‚Äúdo you know how to French kiss?‚Äù. Now I‚Äôm not saying I‚Äôm the world‚Äôs best or most experienced kisser but my kissing style hadn‚Äôt been an issue with past partners. 

I‚Äôm of course open to constructive criticism and learning what my partner prefers, but I felt like the way she delivered the line was a bit insensitive and it threw me off my game and I got in my head. I did ask her how she preferred it and she responded a little frustrated and said ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt teach you how to do it‚Äù. She eventually gave me the advice to ‚Äúnot move your lips and just move your tongue‚Äù. I had never really done it that way before but I tried it that way and apparently that wasn‚Äôt what she was looking for either. I tried to diffuse the situation by saying we would work on it and figure out what worked for us. She responded saying ‚Äúno, you‚Äôll work on it‚Äù. She tried to say it softly but the comment didn‚Äôt make me feel great because I felt like I was genuinely trying to understand how she preferred it and I felt like I just got back a lot of blame and frustration from her when a more gentler approach would have been better.  

We eventually decided not to use much tongue when we kissed and she said she enjoyed that better. But later when she was touching me through my underwear I wasn‚Äôt getting aroused because I was still rattled by the earlier exchange. I told her that I was still in my head over the kissing critique and we decided to stop. I went home and the next day she texted me saying she felt connected to me emotionally but didn‚Äôt think we were compatible physically. She was nice enough in the breakup text but I am still really bothered by her tone and her general attitude during the criticism.  I took all the blame for the situation in my response and told her I had some anxieties I was trying to work through. 

I didn‚Äôt tell her how the delivery of the critique bothered me but I wish I would have so that we could have talked it through. She was always very sweet to me before this so it was very surprising that her tone wasn‚Äôt gentler. I know it wasn‚Äôt her intent to hurt my feelings but I do wish I had let her know how it made me feel.  I initially wanted to ask for a second chance to see if we could establish the physical connection but now I‚Äôm wondering if her handling of the situation was a red flag or if I am just being too sensitive.

Was there a better way for her to handle giving me the critique? Was there anything I should have done differently? 

It‚Äôs been about a month since we last spoke but the interaction still bothers me and is making me feel like I should have stood up for myself and been open about the fact that I was uncomfortable.","Homie, you didn‚Äôt do anything wrong. She didn‚Äôt like the way you kissed, and she became sarcastic and snarky about it. Unless you were biting her painfully or slobbering over her face in a gross way, it probably is not that serious and probably did not warrant being rude. It‚Äôs not your fault that you got in your head about that. After all, you like her and want her to feel good. You even tried to ask her how she likes it and got sarcastic response to *that*. 

*In my experience, someone who gets an attitude when you‚Äôre actively and genuinely trying to find ways to please them probably has their own personal issues they need to work through, and is most definitely a walking red flag*.

Our economic situations are fairly similar in that we're both on rather strict budgets. For the most part, when we go out we split things based on the costs of our meals (his insistence). I don't have too much of an issue with this, but it would be nice for one of us to treat the other every now and then (I've treated him by paying for dinner once).  
At any rate we went to a restaurant where it was an order in one part and seat yourself kinda deal. I grabbed the table and told him what I wanted. He ordered and brought the food to our table. I asked him how much I owed him; however, apparently he didn't hear me. We had a nice dinner, shared food and he even sipped some of my alcoholic beverage I grabbed from the bar (he did not want one). Here's the rub: he's not a big texter. He rarely initiates texts, but promptly and enthusiastically responds. Two days after the date I wake up to a text from him asking if I could Zelle my portion of dinner. Nothing more. To say I was disappointed is an understatement.  I Zelled him and explained I did ask him what I owed and when he didn't answer I thought he was treating me.  
I'm seeing him this weekend and could use some advice on how to tactfully address this. It isn't about the money, it's the manner in which it was done. TIA!","This was a simple misunderstanding. I‚Äôd put it aside and continue on as before. I get why you were deflated but if you like him I‚Äôd forget about it. 

You could say in person ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt mind that you wrote about the check but I guess I got excited at first that you were writing to say hello.‚Äù 

Maybe he‚Äôll step up his texting."

dating,1456xm8,2023-06-09 14:35:33,House maintenance when living with boyfriend,"I had a breakdown today because I got triggered when my boyfriend puts my newly washed clothes on top of my sister‚Äôs really really smelly clothes. The resentment has been piling up for a while now. 

A little bit of my background: I am about to start college in September. Right now I have a lot of things on my plate. Me and my boyfriend are almost 9 months into dating and we live back-and-forth in each others‚Äô house. 

However, I‚Äôm starting to notice that he doesn‚Äôt care about house maintenance and organizing as much as I do. 

Not only him, when I‚Äôm staying at my own house, my younger sister is the worst. She would pile up unclean laundry in the bathroom to the point it collapses and fills the floor; she would also never washes the dishes no matter how many days they‚Äôre left in the sink and wait until I do it for her. She claims herself to be a perfectionist and gets mad whenever I said I don‚Äôt think she is one. I don‚Äôt know maybe it‚Äôs some 16-year-old‚Äôs common issues during puberty. So when I am in my own house I‚Äôm always cleaning already, I would also use my own part-time salary to buy different items for the house to look tidier. Yet my stepmom (I‚Äôd rather call her my dad‚Äôs wife) would still complain that I am messy and a germ to this family. It kinda explains why I‚Äôve been building that resentment in me. 

One day I heard my boyfriend arguing with his mom about clearing the clutter in the house. Apparently he doesn‚Äôt care about house maintenance as much / prioritise it at the moment, I do always notice that he doesn‚Äôt mind if the room is messy or if anywhere is not tidy in the house, he can just live with it. This fact bothers me. 

Maybe it is because I have always been taking care of my sister‚Äôs mess while still being complained as a messy person. I tried my best to maintain the house already and even prioritise it over all my studies and sleeping schedule, and people still can‚Äôt see it. 

I want things to work out between me and my boyfriend. I‚Äôm scared I can‚Äôt handle it if it‚Äôs going to be like this in the future. Today‚Äôs breakdown really make me realize how heavy this has been on me and I feel like people around me doesn‚Äôt understand how messy the house is and how hard I‚Äôve been trying to maintain it. 

I tried meditation, I tried effective communication (with my boyfriend, cannot with my sister cause she thinks the whole world is against her), I tried gratefulness, I tried breaking down tasks and divide workload (he always leaves mess or things undone behind). Please tell me what I can do anymore, before I have another breakdown again.","let me first tell you that you're handling it extremely well, and this stress is perfectly normal. dude needs to get his shit together, you're not his mom.

as somebody that has dealt with not one but THREE long term girlfriends that do this exact thing, you have three options:

1. **ask him to go to couples therapy with you (non-atomic).** it will really raise the stakes and show that you're serious. moreover, these problems aren't relationship-specific. he's not inherently wrong for being messy, but it's a very big compatibility between you two. a therapist will present options to try and fix the issue, and he will realize that things are getting serious and he'll need to change his ways to make it all work.
2. **accept that this is how the relationship is going to be (non-atomic).** some people are just messy slobs. if you're not, you need to seriously look at the rest of your life and if you can handle living with this dude. sometimes it's worth it for some people. relationships are all about compromises. only you can decide if it's worth it.
3. **give him an ultimatum (semi-atomic).** definitely not my favourite option as i generally don't believe in ultimatums, but you need to let him know that you're serious. tell him he needs to clean up after himself and all that, or you're leaving. understand that you need to stick to your guns with this, which may be painful.
4. **leave (atomic).** i've found that people like this only change ever temporarily. they'll see that you're serious, change for a week or so, then go back to their old ways. only you can decide if it's worth turfing the relationship over."
dating,1456wjj,2023-06-09 14:34:21,My boyfriend is very hot and cold,"My (22F) boyfriend (26M) has been really hot and cold lately. We‚Äôve been together for a year, and at the beginning of our relationship he used to be so affectionate and we would both buy each other little gifts, tell each other about the little funny things going on about our day. 

The past couple months, sometimes when he comes over (or I go over his), he‚Äôs immediately so cold. He doesn‚Äôt smile, doesn‚Äôt seem happy to see me. I feel like I‚Äôm always the one that‚Äôs listening to him, and when I try to speak about something he‚Äôs not interested and doesn‚Äôt really listen. I still make him small gifts and send him those small occasional updates to let him know I‚Äôm thinking of him, but it doesn‚Äôt seem like he care. He doesn‚Äôt share as much anymore. 

I‚Äôm not sure if he was just doing that to get me to be his girlfriend/fall in love with him, or if he‚Äôs falling out of love with me. Some days he is SO affectionate and will gush over me, but most days now he just feels cold and distant. I never know what to expect when we hangout.",leave. it‚Äôll only get worse.
dating,1456swl,2023-06-09 14:30:19,Thoughts about having someone over,"Ok, bear with me here please bc I (42f) have a weird hangup. I have a hard time with having a man in my house (like even platonic). Its a psychic energy issue non trauma related, I'm just sensitive to other people's energy. I will only have a partner over once we have been in an established and committed relationship for around 2 or 3 months. I'll sleep with someone fairly early on or just hookup at their place, but for me, having a man in my home is like introducing them to my parents. Like, that's real intimacy for me. 

I'm curious and I'd like to get an idea from everyone about how they would feel about this/if anyone else does this. I'm not really necessarily for psychoanalysis, but more of your thoughts and would you view this as a red flag and why. 

Tldr: I don't have men over unless in an established relationship","I don‚Äôt think this is weird and I would say I‚Äôm similar. I like to keep my space, well, MY space. I don‚Äôt like to invite people over unless I‚Äôm very close to them. 
I have had times where I‚Äôve had guys over and the whole time I feel on edge and I‚Äôm always ready for them to leave. Sometimes even feeling a physical and emotional relief when they do leave. Rarely, have I had a partner over where I haven‚Äôt felt somewhat invaded and I‚Äôve always preferred to spend time at their place. 
It‚Äôs something I just kind of deal with and as I get to know someone better it eases."

I catch myself nearly saying I love u as we leave to go to work and stop myself. I know he at least cares about me a lot and he listens to what I say and if I‚Äôm in a mood he‚Äôll do anything to make me laugh. 

Should I tell him I love him or wait and let him say it first. I don‚Äôt want him to be pressured to say it just because I said it. I don‚Äôt want him to panic or freak out either. 

I would rather he say it first because that way I know it‚Äôs true but I‚Äôm not against saying it first. 

I just don‚Äôt know how to tell if he‚Äôs ready to hear it yet.",Tell him. I think you can tell how he feels about you too. As guys we're socialized to never be the one to say it first.

so long story short, my older brother has been friends with this dude since forever, they grew up together etc and are pretty close. I‚Äôve hung out more than a couple times with him and my brother, nothing one on one. 

I‚Äôve gotten to know him a little better and he is honestly so funny, attractive, and intelligent. he is single with occasional girlfriends but nothing serious. 

we get along really well and can keep a conversation going despite the age difference. I know this is said a lot but I am mature for my age and a lot of people comment on it, even my parents. I am in college for a job close to graduating, and I already have a good job. I drive too.

he has a good career going as well.

so my brother has even joked, saying that if I was a little bit older he would try to get me and his friend together. 

I‚Äôve been thinking about it a lot and I am genuinely interested but I have no idea how to make a move without making things awkward‚Ä¶ we text occasionally, and he is always happy to talk to me but I don‚Äôt want to overstep any boundaries, and I can‚Äôt tell if he‚Äôs just being friendly or if he would potentially date me. 
I want to ask my brother about it but I‚Äôm afraid if I do he will tell him. Idk.

I think I may be too young and he could never see me in that way, but who knows. I have massive feelings for him and I‚Äôm going to be upset once he finds a girlfriend which is why I want to make a move. I wish I was a bit older so the age gap stigma wasn‚Äôt being affected here.

dating,14567ky,2023-06-09 14:06:16,New relationship drama,"I (m27) have been dating a woman (f23) for about a month now. We met on a rather romantic date and she and I felt such a connection that we slept together on the second date. The sex was amazing and we both had fun. Beyond that she has a ton of what I would consider green flags. She‚Äôs a bit immature, but I have a lot to work on too and I always looked forward to seeing her.

Initially things have been amazing except she kept prying into my past. I deliberately don‚Äôt bring it up because I know it will only play on my and her insecurities and lead to strife. I only care about the future.  One day, we‚Äôre together and she asks if I‚Äôm dating a lot and how she knows that she‚Äôll be special. I explain that I have dated a few times, but generally don‚Äôt go further than getting to know someone because I need to feel a connection with someone in order to sleep with them. I then proceeded to ask what her dating experience was like. She said that she‚Äôd only been on two dates in the past me being the second. This floored me as some of what we did together during sex did not indicate someone who was inexperienced, so I inquired and asked that she explain because I was confused and she said that in college she didn‚Äôt have time to date so she would just meet random people on tinder and have them come over for hook ups, then send them on their way. Due to how conservative this woman is I didn‚Äôt expect it and was a bit taken aback. So I did the insecure thing and asked her how many she had slept with. She said she didn‚Äôt know and so I asked if it was more than 3, 10, and after I asked about 20-30 she said she didn‚Äôt keep a list. I have slept with 6 people in my past as well, but those had been committed partners.

I view sex as something that should only be done between people who have a strong connection, so the idea of opening one‚Äôs body up to complete strangers on a whim is crazy to me. 

I will admit I reacted badly to this and handled it poorly. I feel like I view her differently now despite KNOWING that sexual history shouldn‚Äôt matter. The way I reacted made her feel bad and I was hoping there was some advice beyond ‚Äúdon‚Äôt care about the past‚Äù because clearly I do. Is this a sort of fundamental incompatibility?","‚ÄúI view sex as something that should only be done between people who have a strong connection, so the idea of opening one‚Äôs body up to complete strangers on a whim is crazy to me‚Äù

Backstory: I (27F) was dating a guy (29M) who I probably shouldn‚Äôt have been dating. Not an overall great human, ended up being pretty emotionally/verbally abusive, and sometimes there were gray areas of potential sexual abuse as well. 

We dated on and off for two years. When we were ‚Äúon‚Äù I got about 8 UTI‚Äôs in two years. Which is obviously not good at all. I was tested several times and always came back negative for any STI. 
Anytime we were ‚Äúoff‚Äù I never got any UTI‚Äôs. 

Of course I know UTI‚Äôs are sex related, typically. But I was doing literally everything right in order to not get one, but still would. 

I‚Äôm wondering if my body was basically rejecting him and being like, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre going to keep doing this until you stop seeing him for good.‚Äù I feel like it‚Äôs possible based on other posts I‚Äôve read, but also feel like it might just be in my head and I‚Äôm being silly about the whole thing.",Maybe he just has really dirty balls.

They responded saying that they may come off as too easy, they‚Äôre nervous and that they already give obvious signals. To their last point, I said ‚Äúobvious signals‚Äù are not necessarily obvious because what might be a signal for one girl could just be a way of being friendly for someone else. 

What‚Äôs your take?","I‚Äôm not scared, I just don‚Äôt do it because I know a lot of men are happy to just take what they can get, and I‚Äôm not so thirsty that I want some guy getting with me just because I offered it up to him.

There‚Äôs an old meme that says men have sex with who they can have sex with and women have sex with who they want to have sex with, and in my 50 years of life I found that to be very true.

I don‚Äôt want a man agreeing to go out with me just because I asked him to and he had nothing better to do, or because he thought I was hot and he wanted to have sex with me even though he has a girlfriend at home.

I met this girl in my classes. Everything started when I sit next to her and then we started talking. I just saw her as a classmate, but after a few days she asked for my IG, someday she even touched my hands intentionally all of sudden, and I noticed that she approaches me more than the necessary. We laugh a lot and have good conversations together. Obviously, I started liking her, so I decided to ask her out. I did not specify if it was going to be a date or just as friends, basically I invited her to come with me to travel to a famous european city for one day and come back the same day, we live near big cities. She accepted and we traveled, we had a good time. Next weekend the same, I invited her to travel again to another city with me, and she said she would love to. The last time was good as well and we had a good time, but this time I decided to tell her that I liked her and I would like to know her more.

Honestly, I was afraid to lose her as a friend but I just said what the hell, I‚Äòll do it.

I told her literally that a friend of mine said to me to ask her (the girl I like) out because she looks cute.

Basically, she laughed and told me that WE are already spending time together and going out. This answer surprised me, I did not expect it so after that, I just said that actually I like her. She didn‚Äòt tell me that she likes me back, she just told me thank you, smiling and being nervous. She looked flattered. So she told me that she didn‚Äòt consider our travels in ‚Äûthat way‚Äú until now, but since I told her I like her, she said that now she considers them in that way. And yeah, she would like to continue hanging out more with me. This happened last weekend. 

A few days ago I ask her out again in person to travel to another city this weekend but she told me that she needs to talk with her friends because she might have plans with them this weekend. So she would let me know but today is Friday and I haven‚Äòt heard from her. Should I contact her again in case she forgot it? 

I‚Äòm so inexperienced on these things, so I don‚Äòt know if she is interesed when she told me those things or she just basically turned me down. What do you guys think?

I have a job that is 'ok' i.e. I make 30k a year. One of the problems I have with dating apps is that most of the women on them are professionals, often making far more money than me. For example, I was seeing a woman for a few months recently who made about 120k a year and I'll openly admit it made me feel insecure. Has anyone else experienced this? Was the key to getting over it just managing your insecurities and dealing with them better etc, or is such a large disparity a no-no on the dating scene, especially when it's the guy making a lot less?

Thanks in advance.","it's OK to feel insecure. men are expected to make more than women, and often do depending on the profession, but realize that it's a stupid stereotype and doesn't serve anybody.

if somebody actually makes something out of you making less money than them, then they're doing you a favour - drop this person immediately."
dating,1452sgy,2023-06-09 11:34:07,What should I do? (22F/21M),"I'm (22F) into a guy (21M) that probably knows I'm into him too (he asked me about it 4 months ago). He rejected me once, because there was someone else at that time (he's single now). Just when I was ready to move on, he started giving me more attention than I had ever expected him to give. For example last weekend when we were at a festival with a group of friends, he was clearly paying attention to me, stood or walked next to me (just the two of us a few times even), made some comments about what I said, positioned his body towards mine, made so much eye contact with me and danced really close to me, looking me in the eye the whole time. These things might seem normal, but compared to his behaviour earlier, he was a lot more attentive towards me. Even my friend said it was 100% clear he's into me. My friend has caught him staring at me often when we've met up recently.

I asked him out last week and we went out a few days ago. We spent 5 hours together, he initiated all the activities, like asked if I wanted to go to the movies (for that time, we had already talked for 3 hours). We didn't have too much physical contact, but he hugged me twice. I texted him the next day to say I had a good time and he said he had fun too. I also saw him the day after the hangout and he looked me in the eye twice and smiled (so I guess he was fine with being around me).

The problem is we can't really make the texting thing work and he hasn't made any plans for the future. I'd be okay to initiate for some time but I'm almost 100% sure he knows I see him as more than a friend and since I asked him out the first time, I feel like it's his turn now. I'd be okay to ask him out again, but I want to know for sure he sees me as more than a friend too.What do you think I should do? Any advice is welcome!","I think you‚Äôve made it perfectly clear that you‚Äôre interested, even going as far as to communicate this to him (which is the hardest part! Good job!). I think you‚Äôre right to feel that the ball should be in his court now, and it‚Äôs time for him to reciprocate if interested and make a move.

However, we men have small, very smooth brains, few wrinkles. You might need to initiate again to make it blatantly obvious. If he doesn‚Äôt initiate plans for a 3rd date it‚Äôs time to move on as he‚Äôs just stringing you along."

I walked her to her building and leaned in for a kiss but she gave me the cheek. We've been in touch via text since (2 weeks ago). She just proposed that we go to an evening museum exhibit and then to a Spanish restaurant where they have live music. I said yes. 
Then I saw that an Uber to the restaurant could be $30. And the restaurant is pricey (dinner and drinks for two could be $175-200). I could afford it but don't have a lot of money.  She seems pretty cool and I don't know if she will offer to split it. I feel like I'll be on edge until that point of the evening occurs. What to do? I don't know her that well yet and not sure how much I like her yet.

dating,14518yn,2023-06-09 10:10:49,Sexual tension off the charts,"Hi! 
I (22f) just met a guy (25m) on a dating app. I saw him for the first time two weeks ago and we had a really pleasant first date. 

He was traveling for the last two weeks but still planned our date right after leaving the airport. 

Then yesterday we had a second date. The sexual tension was off the charts. I couldn‚Äôt keep my hands to myself and neither could he. We watched a movie and listened to music and I had to push him back a few times while making out because we definitely would have ended in the bedroom. I was very clear about the fact that I wanted to wait longer to have sex and he was very understanding. But then, out of nowhere I‚Äôd find myself on top of him and he‚Äôd be grinding on me. 
We went as far as dry humping and he bit my nipples‚Ä¶ Anyway, I‚Äôve never experienced this before. 
And, he‚Äôs bringing me on a third date tonight. 


I‚Äôm just scared this will make him only interested in sex. 
We discussed the option of waiting longer (3 months to be exact) and he looked fairly disappointed. I do not have the intention to wait 3 months, but I‚Äôm worried once we have sex, he won‚Äôt want to see me again or he‚Äôll get some form of post nut clarity. 
The first time I had sex with my ex, he distanced himself. He stopped talking and the next day, he called me back saying he wanted to see me again. He told me usually he detaches himself after sex whether he thinks the girl has dating potential or not and the reason he called me back is because he still enjoyed our time together after sex. Ive been worried since then that a guy will realize he‚Äôs not into me after sex. 

Any advice or opinion would be very appreciated!
Thank you!!

TLDR: The sexual tension was off the charts on the second date. I‚Äôm worried he‚Äôll have post but clarity and not want to see me after sex.","Ok, you've done the hard part and identified the core issue.

>I do not have the intention to wait 3 months, but I‚Äôm worried once we have sex, he won‚Äôt want to see me again or he‚Äôll get some form of post nut clarity.

Due to some unfortunate past experiences, it's understandable that you're going in a bit reserved. I'm detecting that you may have some problems with self-esteem and maybe self-image and I would encourage you to talk to someone to help you work through this.

I would argue that if he buggers off once you two have sex, it was never meant to be and you can keep on looking for a better fling. Dating apps aren't always ideal and I know that a lot of men will use it for 'uncommitted activities'. I would also encourage you to identify what your minimum standards are, what you're *actually* looking for, and then to not settle for anything less.

In the meantime - I'd say, why not have a bit of fun, have some hot sex, and if he buggers off so what? It wasn't meant to be, and you had a good time in the meantime. I hope this helps!"

dating,1450g45,2023-06-09 09:26:05,Should I give my girlfriend a chance?,"TLDR below. 

I've (26M) been dating this girl (24F) for the past 6 months. She is the most amazing person I have dated, we click in pretty much everything. For the first time I feel light in a relationship, which is great. We are already living together and things were going well.

I've been living abroad for some time now, and will be back to living with her soon. However, I noticed some red flags I cannot ignore.

She is very insecure. Can't blame her, though: she has been cheated and abused by her exes, and some horrible things happend in her past. Things she will probably never tell me, that's how bad it is. So it's no surprise she has trust issues, which have gotten worse since I came to another country.

I found out she has been checking my follows on Instagram. A few days ago, when I added some friends I met (one of which a woman), I got a text from her saying ""You better not be meeting women while you're there"". Solely based on the people I followed. And that really scared me. I have no intentions to cheat, and I understand why she is insecure, but this wasn't the first time this conversation happened. She used this threatening tone with me more than once, but when I point it out, she always says she is sorry and admits she has a problem.

She started therapy because of this issue. And said this will NEVER happen again. She wants to be better, she knows it's a problem. I want to believe she can recover, but I don't think that is going to be quick and easy. Her past is really, really dark. Not only because of crazy exes, but her whole childhood was abusive.

She has no mental illness, though. That was one of the great green flags I got since the beginning (been through some dark times due to crazy exes). But apparently being sane is not enough hahaha

So now I have to choose: either give her a chance to prove she can get better... or RUN now, soon enough so I won't get too hurt. Sure I will go through some grieving, but i would get over it.

It's been 6 months, and we are a great couple. I just don't know if I'm willing to go through the pain of waiting for her to overcome the trust issues in therapy. There's probably a lot underneath those ""small"" red flags that I still don't see.

There hasn't been a major dealbreaker yet, but I don't know if I should wait to see if there will be.

Tldr: me (26M) and 6 months GF (24F). She could be ""the one"". But she has trust issues and a pretty dark and traumatic childhood. She started therapy and all, but I don't feel it's gonna be that easy. There hasn't been a major dealbreaker yet, but I don't know if I should wait to see if there will be.",Personally i would give her a chance. Thats something she can grow out of for sure

dating,144zuzj,2023-06-09 08:52:25,My fuckbuddy said she loves me - what do?,"I (28f) have been having cybersex with a girl (34f) for a little over half a year now. We talk almost every day and we're very sexually compatible.
However the other day she said ""I love you"" while we were mid adult-fun-time. She had orgasmed a few times at this point and was close to another so I just assumed she wasn't thinking straight and I just replied by telling her how beautiful she is etc. She said it again in the session but again I just showered her with loving words and moved on.

But then she said it again the day after while we were just chatting and I panicked.

Why would she say that? She knows we don't plan on ever meeting in person (her own rule not mine).

The worst part is I used to struggle not to say it to her sometimes (while we were having sexy time and while we were talking normally). So now I'm even more on edge!

I know she doesn't mean it because she doesn't want to meet irl. She knows I have fun with other people sometimes, and I know she does too. That doesn't sound like an ""I love you"" kind of situation to me...

dating,144zrx8,2023-06-09 08:47:31,Just need someone advice üôè,"Very long post, but please read through. I really need someone to drill sense in my head.ü•≤

Soo, I've been dating this guy since past three months. And we both agreed on keeping it casual. Though I was reluctant at first but events agreed because I like him so much. He is really nice and I really really like talking to him and i guess this is mutual.

Now I've noticed something. Whenever he talks to me and everything is going good, I don't feel the urge to message him all day long. Infact sometimes I also daydream about the future that what if I don't end up with him( and I'm not really scared about it, like it doesn't make me feel agitated as if he's the last guy). 

But as soon as even jokes about ignoring me or just doesn't to talk to me because he's busy due to genuine reasons,my god I just get so worked up. Though I try my best to not show it to him. I've to fight the urge to message him. Like if he's told me he's busy, i just want to not msg him at all ,but ughhh. 

Like recently he had his exams and i told him that he can msg/call me whenever he's free. And i only msgd him to wish him luck. But he didn't msg me at all. Like I get it, you're busy. But how long does it take to say hi. And he had the time to go to friend's birthday and get drunk. And during this time he also installed bumble.  And this entire situation made me just so sad, it felt like someone was digging their fingers in my brain. Nonetheless I spoke to him about it and he explained the entire situation about exams. And about bumble he said he just downloaded to see how it is and uninstalled it later(i still don't know how to feel about it, nonetheless I just ignore it).

So I just want to know why does this happen? Like why do I get so so worked up about it? I mean I'm an overthinker and i can't even focus on anything else when i feel like he might be ignoring me.  How do I avoid it?

Also does it happen to all the women? Like if a guy you like, ignores you do you feel that same agitation? And even if you try to ignore them back you just end up messaging them because you can't take it?",
dating,144zh0p,2023-06-09 08:29:50,Do I still have hope after she cancelled our date?,"I recently went on a couple of dates with a girl. Our first date was perfect - we went to a bar and then to a light party with my friends. We had a drink and everything was good. Our second date was at an arcade with drinks and good food. She even proposed the second date and she looked happy and cheerful. We kissed and then I left. The next day, our texts were constant and better than before. We met up again at a pub after she drunk texted me. We danced and made out. She asked me if I liked her and I said yes. I also asked her if she liked me and she said yes.  
  
However, things took a turn when she cancelled our next date with a valid excuse. I sensed something was wrong because our texts were off. I asked her if she was uncomfortable on Saturday because I was drunk as well. She explained that our lifestyles didn‚Äôt match and she would feel bad to continue because I had been good to her and she had been really comfortable talking to me. She said we would continue talking.  
  
My plan is, ive got nothing to loose and the least i want to do is make her feel uncomfortable. So ill try again next week to ask for 1 more date to see how things are, 90% she would not accept, but that would me my last try.  
  
She sent me this message: ""Look, I didn‚Äôt say it as if there was something wrong with your way of living or that you have to change things, don‚Äôt take it like that! üëÄ I say it because it sounds in your audio as if I had told you that you had to do less things or something like that but it‚Äôs not because I feel something different between our evolutions/ways of being etc. that you have to change your way of being or living - I don‚Äôt know if I explain myself well.  
  
And I don‚Äôt say it as if I didn‚Äôt want to see you, I say it more than anything also so that you understand my position :)""  
  
I reacted really bad to the message trying to justify how we cant know someone in just a few dates. Do you think there is still hope for us?",I don't really understand her reading in that explanation text of hers. I say give it some time and try again later.
dating,144z8u9,2023-06-09 08:16:01,I'm just 22. And I think I cannot fit in with girl of my age.,"A days ago I (male) met a 35 year old woman in a dating app. She was the only one who accepted my like. I dated her and I will have something casual with her.

The reason I decided to set up the age range between 30 and 40 despite me being in my early 20s is because I cannot conect with girls around my age (18-22). 

I'm very serious, and quiet. Once a time a female classmate, who is 19, told me I give ""old man"" vibes. 

I think that's the reason why girls of my age don't want to date me. They want someone more youthful. But I am not like that. But also I'm not an old man.

I don't know I think I'm little confused. I only have had one serious relationship, and she was 19; very modest and christian girl. But now it seems I cannot attract someone similar. Or I could do it but I'm not a religious person and pretending to be a christian just to get a girlfriend would not be viable.

dating,144xu2p,2023-06-09 06:54:20,What should I feel if I accidentally ruined my relationship 3 months in ?,"So I dated this girl and it lasted for 3 months. She was entertaining me so long so I thought there was something or a chance. We aren't bf and gf. Just dating getting to know each other

This last date I don't know what happened and suddenly my plans weren't going well. There was also not much to talk about and I am having a hard time coming up with a topic so I just asked questions randomly about our relationship and so on. Like is it going well etc. It wasn't that bad but there was moments where it would just be quiet but I just thought it was one of those days.

The next day we planned to eat or just drop her off at home if she was tired. She said is it okay if we just skip dinner.  I said it's okay 3 times since she said sorry 3 times. I said who am I to complain after her saying sorry the 3rd time. My intention wasn't bad it was just I didn't want her to feel sorry for skipping dinner. I guess her saying sorry 3 times made me say it. She was very sorry and it was okay with me since there will be a next time.

The next day came and I said good morning she didn't reply anymore. There was something I said that turned her off I am not sure but when I asked her she said none and she just didn't feel a connection and personalities didn't jive that much. 

I feel like I said something still that turned her off. Did I define relationship too much ? Ask too many questions ? Didn't ask that much which resulted to quiet moments ? Was I rude when I said who am I to complain ? Not enough confidence when I she asked what I would do if someone else was entertaining her ? I can name more but can't remember.

A lot of people are saying just forget it and move on and it's her lost you didn't do anything bad don't overthink it you did your best don't blame yourself etc.

How should I react if I may have ruined my relationship ?  Should I forgive myself for not doing my best or forgive myself for my best wasn't enough ? Should I feel guilty ? Should I be ashamed of myself ? 

I am feeling very guilty for ruining the relationship if I said something. I didn't even mean it and my intetion wasn't bad. I just wanted to know and not have awkward silence. 

I am confused and sad and I want to be angry at myself. I am lost at what I should feel since the way it ended was either sudden and too generic of a reason to pinpoint what I did wrong.","> There was also not much to talk about and I am having a hard time coming up with a topic so I just asked questions randomly about our relationship

Matched with a lady on Facebook Dating, instant chemistry, clicked amazingly well, things were going fantastic, after a couple of weeks, she says she's got too much going on in her life and doesn't think she has the time or energy for a relationship.

Then earlier tonight, we're talking on the phone, and out of nowhere, she tells me that she's probably getting ready to move out of state to pursue a job. What??

Also, they might want to date only for casual things, nothing serious. If they feel you're developing feelings for them, they might cut things loose.   
They might also realize after a few weeks that you're not a good match and so, they decide it's better to breakup and give face saving justifications.     
They could also have found a better suitor and decide to jump ships.

That's just the hard truth of dating, especially on online platforms where women get infinitely more matches than men.   
For your own sanity, meet people the good ol'way."

I wad hesitant on dating her when i first met her but she kept showing me love and affection and made me feel like i was special and important. I started to get sexual with her cause i took her flirts in a weird way and our relationship started off sexually. I then asked her out during the heat of the moment and regretted it after. I kept lying to myself telling myself that its gonna be ok and that i really did love her and stuff. It didnt feel better that her friends are my friends and i always feel like i will fuck everything up somehow and i did. My fear of me using her and leading her on and stuff made me want to slow things down, but when i did i started seeing her more like a really close friend. This girl had a crush on me and we only knew eachother for a month now. When i told her i felt like we were friends it broke her heart. Now she talks about not wanting to date anymore and she ghosted me and never told me goodnight like we usually do. I cant sleep. When i try i can only dream of her. Everything we had now i feel like is gone and that i dont mean anymore special than her normal friends and she no longer will put effort in our relationship like she did before all this happened. I love her in a way i cannot understand she means so much to me and has made me and my life happier and i want to date her but I don‚Äôt have the feelings to date her atm I don‚Äôt really know her and i want to get to know her before i wanted to date her again. She took things the wrong way i think i dont know. Im a jackass now i ruined her hope for love and the things that made our relationship special in the first place.

We flirt frequently, joking/not jokingly ask risqu√© questions, talk daily, both have busy schedules for work. 

He said he enjoys getting to know me and is having fun, although the amount of effort of getting to know me has decreased. I don‚Äôt want to have sex with him immediately, even though physically I want to, I want to get to know him more and develop more of a connection and I told him these things and he said he of course wouldn‚Äôt rush me into anything physical. When I asked what he was looking for since I ‚Äúdon‚Äôt want to waste his time if he‚Äôs looking for an immediate hook up‚Äù, he gave me the above reasons and said we are having fun and are both busy. 
I know I want a relationship and seeking more of an emotional connection, but he seems to not want that as much. I‚Äôm excusing it as that he‚Äôs just hard to open up. 

Am I rushing trying to develop more substance with him before getting physical after a month of talking? Or am I wasting my time? As much as I am turned on by him, I don‚Äôt want to get attached and heart broken.

The last wedding I attended was with my girlfriend of two years (we broke up shortly afterwards). Then a few years ago I went to a stag and doe for a coworker and, frankly, I was miserable the whole time. 

To me, weddings represent everything I could never imagine having in my life: trust, security, and a lifelong commitment to grow and flourish with another person. My dating life has been littered with short, unfulfilling relationships. Women always seem to get sick of me pretty easily (I get it, I'm not an easy guy to loveüòî) or there's just no spark. Or they just like to play head games. My last serious relationship (a year) ended six years ago. Now I'm lucky if I see the same woman for longer than two months. I dont even try flirting with women anymore I'm so burned out. So when I hear that two people wanna spend the rest of their lives together, why should I be happy for them?

I waited a whole year for him to talk to me but he never did. Heck, I even texted him and tried to have a conversation and nothing happened. And I really wonder, is it because they're scared or their ego is so fragile that it'll be shattered by rejection?

Idk (But I'm pretty sure they don't). The only option is maybe they all view me as good enough to hit on but not good enough for a relationship (and it's not like I look like some floozy person who can't commit.

Guy at my new job is giving me signals but don‚Äôt know how to approach it

- Checking me out after I leave to go up the stairs‚Ä¶ he glances up at me. Even looking back when he leaves a conversation with me smiling, says ‚Äúbye j****‚Äù and usually winking.

- opens the door for me when I‚Äôm walking with him/holds the elevator open with his hand blocking it for me to get on. Think people can sense it as he‚Äôs not like that with other people‚Ä¶.

- when his coworkers made a mess for me to clean up the following morning, he was the only one who apologies for the mess. Further in that day, after his meeting he proceeded to stay back to clean while his coworkers were going to leave it for me. He then proceeded to say ‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry, I cleaned up‚Äù with a wink. I‚Äôm a receptionist so do a lot of cleaning after meetings‚Ä¶.
- smiles mutually back at each other passing each other and hi‚Äôs, followed by him looking back at me smiling. 
- winks bye to me when getting off the elevator (almost like a subtle sign when other people got off and he was last to get off) or when he‚Äôs with someone and their talking so he can‚Äôt talk
-waves hi from across the street with his lunch friends and smiles walking past each other
- seems nervous just as much as me, almost like he gets awkward when I walk in the room and stares at me and can‚Äôt stop looking at me
- Followed me on our work platform
 
Almost like we have this connection without much talking as he‚Äôs always with other people.

I mean he's a gentleman, always wants me to be happy, has a good job, constantly trying to pay for stuff and buy me things ( wich actually kind of gets on my nerves and I told him that but he still continues to I do it) 
So turns out he is also super clingy, like literally just stares at me all the time, follows me from room to room when we are at my house and is always like kissing me and touching me no matter where we are and I'm not the biggest fan of PDA especially so early in the relationship because idk it just kinda feels forced at that point and yeah fuck that.
And yes he knows how I feel about PDA and all that and he still literally always does it. Even when I am obviously very annoyed by it and verbally telling him to cut it out. Still does. All. the. Time.
In a addition, he comes over to spend the night and then just like stays for days on end. I mean I do enjoying his company but like I need some of my day to my self. Like go home and I feel like I make it super obvious that I want him to like just go home for a bit but idk
I really liked him alot I thought and my sister and the rest of my family like him a lot and we are Facebook official and literally every time he speaks to me now I just get the ick. Help me. I really don't want to hurt his feelings or be mean but he has to know how I feel I mean I don't hide my emotions at all so I'm obviously annoyed 24/7 also I spent all day yesterday finding things to do outside or in another room just to get a little break. Still follows me. So last night I was feeling really stressed and just needed to be alone so I just hoped in my car, went to a friend's house and left him at my house. Not even 2 hours later he shows up at said friend's house and doesn't fucking leave. Been here all night. He has his own place and shit I just don't know to unfuck myself here.

From middle school through college, I never dated anyone, because I never crushed on anyone. I've always been very attracted to overweight women, and I can count on just one hand the amount of girls that I found remotely attractive in my years at school.

I work full time, trying to get a better job so I can move out on my own, and I keep thinking about the future. When I really think about it, I've always fantasized about gaining a little weight with someone, being fat and happy together. I like reading stories or looking at art with this topic, and I used to always feel hopeful and excited about the future. Now they just make me feel very sad and lonely. I'm worried that I'll never get to share that with someone and it scares the hell out of me.

I guess I'm writing this cause I have no idea where to begin. I've never kissed a girl, asked anyone out before, any of that stuff. Sex education for teenage me was a small religious book and a lecture to ""stay away from porn"". I joined a dating site for people into fat/weight gain a few years ago, and besides the fact that it's every bit as shitty as any other dating platform, I'm just so damn shy. I rarely check it anymore.

I'm already thinking of a few changes I can make. I go to therapy weekly and could talk about this, could try new hobbies, start exercising and improve my mood and libido. I've acknowledged I'll probably be better off dating a girl I meet in person, and opening up to her about what I want as the relationship progresses.

A word of warning though, because you're inexperienced it will be very easy for you to get attached to someone you think could be the one. Just be weary and don't rush anything."
dating,144qyjk,2023-06-09 01:05:19,Why is it so hard to find a woman without tattoos?,"As an individual with a personal preference, I have made the decision not to pursue romantic relationships with women who have tattoos. Physical appearance plays a significant role in attraction and compatibility. For me, tattoos are a visual element that can potentially detract from a person's natural beauty or distract from their unique features. Why is it so hard to find a woman without tatttoos? I mean who wants to be an 80 year old in a nursing home with a tattoo?

Also, Im 32 male.......not sure if its a generational thing or not?",Maybe date women from conservative or religious backgrounds
dating,144qx3w,2023-06-09 01:03:22,Are these qualities red flags?,"So I currently have a fwb and I genuinely really like him and always have fun when we hang out even when it‚Äôs not sexual, but  I‚Äôve got a lot going on and am not ready to make things official. 

Anyway over the last week he has been relatively pushy about turning it into a serious relationship which I completely understand, though he knows of my situation and I explained to him why I wanted to wait a bit longer. Now he‚Äôs starting to ask me if I‚Äôm feeling overwhelmed by him and if I want to continue when I tell him I can‚Äôt hangout, he also said he loved me even though we‚Äôre not dating, and tonight I told him I didn‚Äôt want to hangout (I traveled today and am exhausted, plus I have work in the morning) but after I said that he posted on his story a song called ‚ÄúNUMB‚Äù and a quote saying ‚Äúyou deserve to be loved and chosen - not almost loved and almost chosen.‚Äù It‚Äôs a good quote but it just makes me feel like shit and kind of gives me the ick if that makes sense. 

Is this a red flag? Or am I just an asshole?","He‚Äôs attached to you and he‚Äôs trying to cope. It‚Äôs tough to be in his situation and yours, but you have to decide whether you want to end it so he can move on or give him some reassurance about where you see the relationship going."
dating,144quwz,2023-06-09 01:00:51,Advice on stopping the hyper-analyzing of the relationship,"I am dating someone after a 13 year relationship/divorce and he is amazing. I could definitely see myself in a long term committed relationship with him so far. However, I feel that mostly due to social media, I am hyper aware of ‚Äúthings to look out for‚Äù, potential red flags, ‚Äúsigns he is losing interest‚Äù and a plethora of other things that I can barely tell if it‚Äôs my own preferences/observations or just toxic dating culture shoving these things down my throat and causing my anxious attachment to flare up and sabotage the relationship (look, how many buzz words did I use in that one sentence!) 
Anyway, aside from trying to stay off social media (which is hard because I also use it as a coping mechanism for these very feelings(!)) do you have any tricks or advice on overcoming this and actually figuring out how you feel about a relationship?",

I usually don't even get past the chatting stage. I will find red flags. For example love bombing, lying, abusive language etc.

In my past I have picked mostly abusive men. They would come on strong and eventually it led to that. However even chatting I have noticed men coming on strong and then being abusive with their language. Not being self aware is another issue and narcissistic.

I sent her a message a week ago. She just replied. So... how long should I wait to write back? A day or two? Or sooner because I don't want to play games?","The messaging phase is just one aspect of the dating ritual, and yet another hurdle to add to all the traditional hurdles where things can go wrong.  If you want to keep your options as wide as possible my advice would normally be to match their energy at this point, the trouble is we don't know what her energy is, whether this is quite typical or there were extenuating circumstances.  

At this point I would probably message sooner rather than later, while at the same time I would definitely not be hanging onto any hopes that anything will happen, so I would continue messaging/finding others."

dating,144ph20,2023-06-08 23:58:28,Nice guy problem,"Basically, I feel like I'm too nice, especially to people who don't deserve it. Society, and the environment where I grew up, expects me to be tough. Let me explain further. I didn't grow up in a rough neighborhood or anything, but my school has a predominantly Black and Hispanic population. Many of the guys there strive to portray a tough, gangsta image, although not all the time. I, on the other hand, am the opposite of those guys.  
  
There was this girl I liked, and here's the thing‚ÄîI couldn't bring myself to approach her because we were so different. We had different styles of dressing, different ways of speaking, and hung out with different crowds. I believe she might have had some interest in me too, but I couldn't overcome the intense male competition. Other guys saw me as a joke or believed she could do better. It's embarrassing to admit, but I felt like they were deliberately trying to undermine me, waiting for my failure. It's cringe-worthy to say out loud, but that's genuinely how I felt. In the end, she ended up being with someone who resembled her more, and that was the end of it. The school year concluded with me being alone, as usual.","The real tough guys in the world don't act or dress like it. The guys who do are compensating for some sort of insecurity they have in their life. Those types will want you to fail, not because you're not good enough but because they see someone who doesn't have to put the tough guy act on to succeed and that challenges their ego because they feel entitled.

Intelligent women have a much better radar for this kind of act. Especially if they've been in relationships with those guys before. So she probably liked you because you weren't like that. The older you get the more people realise this. High school caters to those guys but in real life they're loosers.

Then a while later he texted back and said he'd really rather have lunch but would have dinner if I really wanted and wanted to make sure we each paid for ourselves. What are female's perspectives on this behavior?,"Male here.

I think you suggesting a drink is perfectly reasonable, that is definitely be my preference for a first date, no question about it.  I do think it is a bit weird that he suggested dinner, then went back to suggesting lunch (which you didn't want to do in the first place), then started wanting assurances that you are going to pay your own way... from the way you've described it, he sounds difficult to me!

dating,144oztx,2023-06-08 23:38:20,Can‚Äôt stop over-thinking how to handle paying the cheque after a date,"The thought of the potential awkwardness that might occur when the cheque comes actually prevents me from going on dates. I am so in my head about who should pay, how to offer, etc, etc. I, being a female, know that it is not uncommon for men to offer to take the cheque (which I am not opposed to), but the uncertainty of whether they will offer, or if I should offer, or how to handle it, is actually crippling.

Anyone else face this anxiety? Any tips of tricks to over come it?

dating,144oqvh,2023-06-08 23:27:36,I (26f) got ghosted by a guy (26m) after him constantly putting in effort for a month.,"I‚Äôm freshly out of a 9 year relationship. My dating history is small compared to most. I‚Äôve always been in a relationship so I‚Äôm not used to dating and talking to new people. But after I decided to cut it off with my ex. (I wanted more form him, he couldn‚Äôt do that). And let this guy. He works right next to me at another bar and would stop in for a beer before work. We‚Äôre both bartenders with a drinking problem. So I would see him occasionally but one day I walked up to him and spoke to him. After that he slowly started coming more and more. We lightly talked and flirted because I would also have a drink after work. When he was having his before work beer. Only 30 minute intervals. He would come exactly at 4:30 and had work at 5:00. The flirting continued and I started sitting with him daily. Same time and same drinks. I liked that he was dominant. He Knew what I was drinking and when he saw that I was getting ready to get off he would order us a round of shots for me to sit with him. He sat in the one chair I always wound before him. So when we started drinking he would sit there and move over when I was off, saving my seat for me. He started coming every. Single. Day. To see me. We worked the same shifts exactly. To everyday I worked I saw him. Same thing. Drinks and flirting. It was crazy because I constantly sat there, receiving. He always paid for my shots. For a month straight. He came everyday, sometimes earlier to spend more time with me, and bought me my drinks daily. He created a whole habit. Bc it takes at least 30 days to form a habit. (Backstory) I‚Äôm a artist who does vendor events, he insisted coming and I was fine with him not coming because he has given me flaky behavior before. And I tried to give him a out to not coming or making it. I told him it‚Äôs fine if you can come, I know you have work that night and it‚Äôs early ( he works the night bar scene so he doesn‚Äôt get off till 2) he insisted it was fine and he would make it. He is the one who invited himself I never gave him any pressure. So the day before we‚Äôre texting and he doesn‚Äôt reply after me. The next day is my event, he doesn‚Äôt show up and never texted me. Like I said I just got out of a relationship I wasn‚Äôt giving him any pressure, but he could of at least texted me. It is now a month later and I never ever got a response from him since the night before my event. The day after my event was a Sunday we both had work. And he didn‚Äôt show up for our scheduled drinks. It has been a month and I haven‚Äôt heard from him. He has came in twice to my job when he knew I wasn‚Äôt working. He follows me on Instagram and looked me up and also followed me on my business Instagram. He has watched all my stories and liked my Instagram post. He keeps up with me. 
Me being new to dating I‚Äôve never been ghosted before. It‚Äôs been super confusing fire me to navigate. How can someone put in sooooo much effort and then nothing. What do you think it means that he still keeps up with me ? What do you think happened and if he didn‚Äôt really care would he still be watching my stuff?","He probably thinks he screwed everything up by missing your event and is avoiding you now. 

If you want to find out what's up DM him on instagram and invite him out for drinks. Don't be all ""why did you ghost me"", just try to have a casual meeting. He'll probably spill the beans. 

If you don't care, then just block him so you don't have to think about it anymore."

Just still devastated and made worse by the fact she still seems to want to get in contact with me and make excuses to message - any ideas on why she does this? Speaking more broadly, why did she not love me back? Why did I fail in my deepest desire? Why do I not get to win at love when all my friends do? Why do people I have no connection with show interest? One thing is for sure, I‚Äôm never falling for anyone again bc clearly I‚Äôm not the type of the kind of people I like.

dating,144oemw,2023-06-08 23:13:36,"Parted ways on good terms with FWB six weeks ago. However, one night when we were drinking, she said something that has been consuming my mind since","Currently laying in bed off from work and I am not sure I can talk to anyone about this.

Originally met this great gal [29F] [29M] at the start of 2022. We hit it off on the first date and the sexual chemistry was amazing, so we starting seeing each other casually. That lasted about 4 months and was a great experience. 

At the start of this year I got burnt out of dating with purpose. Sort of felt like my time and energy wasn't received or reciprocated very well. I was looking for something casual and reached out to her, she was interested in my proposition.

This time around, it was far more intense in just about every way, alot happened. I truly enjoyed spending time with her because I felt I could be myself. For example we both opened up to each other and shared tough stories of our past, which I normally don't unless I'm comfortable. I've only done this with two of my long term ex GFs for example.

To recall on that night when we were blind drunk: We were discussing the two of us moving foward, as in a potential relationship. Towards the end of the conversation she uttered the words ""you can't offer me nothing"". I remember going quiet, essentially shutting down my willingness to communicate. That next morning, things didn't feel the same. We ended things respectfully.

Yet another big surgery lies around the corner for me and hopefully the last. I moved back in with my dad in 2019 when I had my first major surgery and missed alot of time away from work. I had no other option and knew it was for the best to for me to not kill my savings and build more, which I have been doing. 

The main point being is, I opened up and explained all of this to her (how I deal with it and what my long-term goals are). This is a big insecurity of mine and am always umcomfortable talking about it. I thought she was aware of that.

I'm not sure why I wrote this but i'm in a bad place mentally and physically right now. I had so much respect for her and that's why I was vulnerable. I'm not sure I can be vulnerable like that again.

Really feel like a loser at the moment because I dont have my own place at 29. I do understand why this is unattractive to women. You should expect a guy of that age to have his stuff together.

However, what she said really destroyed my confidence and future desires for dating all around. Or maybe this was something I need to hear. 

I have been self-reflecting alot lately and I need to work on heaps of things. My main focus is getting properly healthy and smashing goals, the main one is independence.

A big thankyou if you got to the end of this word vomit. Be as honest and blunt as you want with me. I'd appreciate any type of feedback. 

Tldr; FWB who I had alot of respect for said ""you can't offer me nothing"" in regards to a realtionship. I had previously opened up to her about my past and present struggles with my health. In turn this has destroyed my confidence.",I don‚Äôt think I could date a woman who says ‚Äúcan‚Äôt offer me nothing‚Äù. Terrible grammar
dating,144oe68,2023-06-08 23:13:02,Found someone. Really happy for once. What I‚Äôve realized,"I‚Äôm a pretty introverted dude. I wouldn‚Äôt say a total loner but typically, I prefer my own company. Dating had always been hard because I overthink quite a bit and was introverted. I finally met someone about 6 months ago and we‚Äôve been dating for 4. I‚Äôve realized that the people you are meant to be with will develop naturally and if you find yourself overthinking a lot, it‚Äôs probably not meant to be. I haven‚Äôt overthought anything with this. We just seem to get each other. Yes, it‚Äôs still relatively new but just wanted to say for all the people struggling, find your own happiness first. I was really happy with being a single dude when we met. I was and still am going to the gym a lot, producing music, working full time and just enjoyed life. I realized that when I came across like I was looking for someone, people picked up on it and was the opposite of a magnet. Just find what allows you to enjoy life and be yourself. You‚Äôd be surprised what happens when you stop focusing on finding someone. It sounds cliche, but sometimes a cliche is a cliche for a reason. I realize I had spent so much time wallowing in loneliness and it‚Äôs embarrassing in retrospect. But we all live and learn. We all make mistakes but we have to learn from them. So to anyone struggling out there, find what you love to do and focus on that, not finding someone. Your person will come along when you least expect it. Just be open to opportunities and not narrow minded and everything will work out.",thank you for shining such beautiful white light

Mainly and simply looking for sites people recommend.  Not looking for hookups. More looking for areas to chat and get to know people. Also maybe some profile/photo suggestions. I absolutely abhore taking photos but understand that's the way now. 

I'm INFJ so while I'm not shy I'm not open about asking someone out. I connect with too many people too quickly so realize it's best to just not ask people out. And I honestly cannot judge age anymore. Thanks. 

Sorry if I missed a post for this as I did look so if someone could link it I'll send cookies.","Hire a photographer to take your profile pics. Go for a couple different locations. 

If you have any friends of your target gender, get them to review your bio.

All the sites/apps are essentially the same - a jungle. Glance through this sub a bit more and be prepared. Don't take any of it personally. 

Remember that asking someone out, going on dates, flirting, etc.. are all skills that you can develop and improve at. 

Stay positive and good luck!"
dating,144o081,2023-06-08 22:57:15,"If you're keeping your options open while dating/sleeping with someone, do you let them know?",Just curious. Would you tell the person you're dating you're also still meeting others? Would you expect to be told by the person you're dating so that you're aware?,"Generally, if you haven't had an exclusivity conversation, then both parties should assume they're not exclusive. This also doesn't hurt to be clear and direct about, though, because there are people who go on dates one at a time with the expectation of something serious. Being communicative is just always a good idea. If it doesn't work out - then you've successfully avoided wasting everyone's time on an incompatible relationship! 

If you are sleeping with multiple people, you should always be open about that because it's a matter of sexual health and people have the right to all the information necessary to make an informed decision about their health."

dating,144ngwe,2023-06-08 22:35:36,How should I move forward? Does this count as getting stood up or just bad situation?,"How to move forward with this? Don‚Äôt know if this counts as getting stood up or just circumstances.

So me and this girl go to same college or did as I am transferring now. We knew of eachother for almost 8 months but never got really close despite hanging within a group of friends. I had not seen her in a few months but happen to run into eachother last day of semester. We talked hanged out that day and continued to text over the next week. I ask her out and she agrees. 

First Date goes amazing. One more week of texting and second date happens, goes good again. Both lasted around 5 hours with multiple places included. We plan our third date for Today and continue texting throughout the week. This texting she seems way more into it and enthusiastic than normal which was a good sign to me. 

As you know the Canada fire happens, and NYC gets killed with smoke and makes the outside unbearable. While texting I bring up the fact of the weather as our date was for an outdoors event. She says she‚Äôs unsure about our date tomorrow because of the weather and we agree to check tomorrow how it is. 
So tomorrow happens, today(The day of date) and we text in the morning as usual and I ask her what she was thinking of the weather and that I could go today or wait for the weekend if she felt uncomfortable. She doesn‚Äôt respond to that for 4 hours and the time of the date is coming up, so I double text to tell her we should go during the weekend as the air quality is still bad unless she‚Äôs not free then we‚Äôll go today and to let me know if we‚Äôre still going today as the event is an hour away from me so I could start making my way there. Doesn‚Äôt respond until she gets off work that she‚Äôs so sorry and that she got busy at work and that she‚Äôll let me know for The Weeknd. 
I haven‚Äôt responded yet and basically in my mind this is her trying to let me down. How should I move forward with this? Should I just put the ball in her court. So far I‚Äôve been initiating most of the texting but she‚Äôs been responding well and everything been going great up until now. Should I continue texting her in the morning tomorrow like I always do or just stop contact all together and let her make all the plans and initiate contact? I usually text her good morning lol. Should I just continue as everything is normal but not bring up the date at all?","As a woman it just sounds like she just needs time to herself and doesn't know how to communicate it. She is most likely not standing you up. I know for me I like to just chill by myself sometimes even if I really like a person, or if I'm experiencing a lot of anxiety I just need to collect myself. It sounds like a throat chakra imbalance where she can't communicate what she feels to you. She likes you. Just give her space to breathe. Yeah send that morning text but if you can feel any sense of being passive aggressive, process that before you text her. Consistency is comforting and security. If she doesn't respond to that text, let it breathe and don't double text her."

I even feel awkward in interactions with strangers because I'm so shy and quiet that nothing useful or interesting ever comes out of my mouth when it's time to socialize, at my job girls are nice to me (probably out of good manners) and I feel strange since normally girls were very mean to me during school and college, I was bullied. I probably, if I don't make the effort to change this self-sabotaging behavior of mine, I shouldn't be complaining about never having had a date but honestly I don't think I'm prepared mentally and physically because I still want to change a lot of things in my body and face.",Are you working with a therapist?

We were laughing a lot and we had a lot of similar past experiences and interests. It was a really good time and I thought she was really enjoying herself too cuz she was laughing and smiling a lot. 

We keep texting the day after and then I ask her on another date. She apologizes saying sorry she‚Äôs busy this weekend. We keep talking then a couple days later I ask next weekend. Bam! Left on read. Been four days since then. I can see that she‚Äôs still active online. Now I realize the ‚Äòim busy‚Äô was just a light way of letting me off. 

Being ghosted sucks so much cuz theres no closure. Ive only been on one date with this girl so in that regards its not that bad. But now ill never know what went wrong. And ik thats gonna haunt me for a long time. I wish ppl were more upfront. I wish she told me why shes no longer interested. Now im always gonna wonder if it was something i said or did, if it was something else. Next time im talking to a girl all ill be able to think about is what if im doing something wrong again. And it wont help if it looks like shes having a good time cuz thats how it was with this girl too. I can already feel it eating away at me. 

Ive been thinking today of sending a follow up text. Just like ‚Äòhey hope all is good. I was just wondering jf i could know what went wrong with us‚Äô, or something like that, but my friends advised against it. I dont know how else to get closure though. What do u guys think?",Therapy is the only way. Ghosting does suck. But therapy will explain why you attracted this. I'm really sorry you did get ghosted. It's so inconsiderate. I used to do it. I'm ashamed to admit it. Now I choose to be very clear about not wanting to continue any form of relationship. The joke about getting ghosted is that everytime the confusion or pain or you think about them comes up it's like their a ghost haunting you. Make peace with the ghost
dating,144n9sn,2023-06-08 22:28:02,Break up,"I'm in my first year of college going into my second in the fall. I've been real close friends with this girl. I've had feeling for her since the start but pushed that aside for the benefit of the friend group. At this time it's been over
7-8 months and her friend tells me discreetly she has started getting feelings for me right before the school year is ending. I didn't want to pursue anything since it would affect the group but I made the first move to break the ice and as the finals ended we spend time talking and getting to know each other more deeply.
Fast forward for now, it's been a month and 1/2 since that and we've been talking, FaceTime, etc every day. I started getting feeling for her and she has dropped the ball of her wanting to end this. She has been not been putting in the effort like he had normally done so for the past week so ik this was coming. She made me change who I am and l've done it for her just to continue this relationship. I wanted to confront her with how I was feeling and after not responding to me she dropped this message.
""i'm sorry (name) i'm just a little busy tonight. i value you as a person but right now i don't think that we should be anything more than just friends. i don't think it's gonna work out for us in the long run and i'd rather stop it before we ruin our friendship. and i just don't think i want a romantic relationship right now or anything serious.""
It's the next day now and she has responded to me by wanting to talk, and dosent want to make me upset. I've assumed the best thing to do is just leave it be as it seems she has been using me for attention this whole time and got me thinking she actually had feelings for me.
I've spoken to some of my other friends and they seem to agree with all the context I showed them, but I want to hear for some other opinions, before I talk to her. Thank you.","I think you're hurt and so prone to being uncharitable about her actions. She liked you, but she realized she values the friendship and integrity of the friendship group more than a potential romantic relationship. That doesn't at all mean she was using you. It means she was also caught up in her feelings, like you, but just came to a different conclusion on how to handle them.

Remember, closure is the gift you give yourself. I'm not sure why a discussion is necessary, but please think long and hard before saying anything that could harm the friendship, such as throwing about baseless accusations."

dating,144mvx4,2023-06-08 22:12:33,Group Exercise Classes,"Has anyone had success stories meeting each other in settings like group fitness classes? Example: yoga, Pilates, boxing, CrossFit etc etc

People consistently suggest group fitness classes/meetups as great ways to meet potential partners.

Just trying to brainstorm other ways of meeting people rather than the apps. Thanks!","Okay, we really need to address this advice people throw out to ""join hobby groups"" as a way of dating.

We're overusing it in a way it was never meant to be utilized.

Reasons why you should join hobby groups:

* To socialize
* To have fun
* To find community
* To get out of the house
* To spend time on yourself and the things you enjoy
* Good for your mental health
* Developing sense of self

Reasons that are **not** good reasons to join hobby groups:

* To date

The reason why joining hobby groups is such a common suggestion is because a lot of people - and this is a fault of how society has been set up more than it may be a personal choice - looking for dates...have no personality. They sit at home browsing the internet and playing video games 24/7 and do literally nothing else. They never really developed a sense of self or figured out what they liked beyond the internet, and they don't do anything offline to interact with others.

Are hobby groups a great way to meet others? Yes! But they're much better for platonic social needs. *Can* this lead to romantic/sexual encounters? Yeah, that absolutely happens. But that should NOT be how you use hobby groups.

You should go to a hobby group because you enjoy or think you might enjoy doing that thing with other people who enjoy doing it. *If*, on the rare and low and off-chance, that leads to a date *one day down the road after you've made friends and been a part of the group for a while* \- good for you! But that's not the purpose of a hobby group and utilizing it like such is only bound to end in bitterness and anger. Even if you enjoy that hobby, you may even end up ruining the hobby for yourself when you rely on it for dates instead of for self-fulfillment and entertainment.

People may also suggest hobby groups because more serious dates are likely to manifest from friendships and acquaintances than from meeting strangers. But this is a long game of patience, and you *cannot* go into it expecting dates. That's already a thing that destroys friendships and makes people - very reasonably - feel used.

Keep this in mind when you see people suggesting these as ways to meet people. They are indeed great ways to meet people. But they are not dating events. If you specifically want dating interactions, then stick to places fostering this - dating apps, speed dating, singles events, matchmakers, etc."
dating,144mfzk,2023-06-08 21:55:59,"Dating Coaches, worth it?","We all know modern dating has become tough and according to statistics people are more single than ever, (Google search it, this sub doesn't let me add links) There has been a steady rise in dating coaches now, What I have noticed is most of these men dating coaches are ladies (~3 out of 4) charging over $4000 for a course more expensive than a university course lol while also most of them (99%) have no experience in dating women or having a successful relationship with a girl. I m no pro but I have no problems in getting dates but I m inexperienced in long term relationships and want one. My relationships usually last less than a year. Is it worth hiring one? Whats your take on this?","No, look on YouTube, there are many channels about dating. If you're willing to spend that much money and time on learning to date, you can spend some time watching YouTube videos.

To name a few:

* Matthew Hussey
* Tripp Advice
* Social Animal
* Courtney Ryan
* Marni your personal wing girl

As always, take everything they show and say with a grain of salt, apply common sense, don't believe everything you're shown/told, use your brain."

dating,144lsbt,2023-06-08 21:30:26,I'm conflicted on what I should do,"Recently I (M21) met a friend of a friend and  she started 'hitting on me'. I've never had sex,dated or even hugged a girl that wasn't wasn't related to me. The reason I'm conflicted is because she has double digit exes and has a boyfriend right now. I'm conficted between the fact that 1. I'm incredibly desperate and lonely and want to have sex to get it out of the way, although I'd tell her bf she's cheating afterwards. Or 2. Not have sex with her and tell her that her boyfriend is cheating, because I feel sympathy for him. Help me out here...",Don't be the piece of shit that knowingly has sex with someone in a relationship. Just move on and let that shit sort itself out.
dating,144lp8z,2023-06-08 21:27:13,Is a movie and a walk a bad date idea?,"There‚Äôs a girl I want to ask on a date and while it will be our first date, we have already been ‚Äúintimate‚Äù a few times and I thought I could ask her on a date where we see a movie and take a walk around the area. Is that a bad idea? Should I postpone that kind of date until we have a few more under the belt or is it fine?","I'd save the movie date for later, at least after three dates. The walk isn't a bad idea, but try to do something beforehand where you can be more social.

First few dates should be a spot where you can actively talk to one another. Sitting in silence for two hours isn't a great way to get to know someone new."

it makes me feel like i am doing something wrong or he is repulsed by me. i am pretty new to dating and most of my dates have at least given me a peck on the cheek at the end. i just want to know if this is common or if i‚Äôm missing something.

dating,144l649,2023-06-08 21:07:27,Lack of sex ?,"Been talking to this girl I‚Äôm 27 she‚Äôs 26.  I have a somewhat high sex drive and supposedly she doesn‚Äôt.  I have sex with this girl a week ago and seen each other 3 times with no sex. She has a vibrator and done some kinky things. She had flings and situationships. So I would assume she would want to have sex often but that isn‚Äôt the case.

She says she‚Äôs not talking to anyone or fucking anyone else. (Neither am I) so im just wondering is it because she has a low sex drive or has to be emotionally be there to have sex?

Don‚Äôt give me a lecture, I know it‚Äôs not all about sex, the deep conversations, hanging out all the time and just talking is important as well.","Maybe you just don‚Äôt turn her on. You need to stimulate her mind to turn her on. If you make her feel like she is just a hole to fill, she probably not going to be interested."
dating,144l3l2,2023-06-08 21:04:51,When do you ask someone to be exclusive?,"So I am debating on when to ask someone to be exclusive, all these dating rules are driving me crazy. Some people say 8 dates the other says 3, but how do you know when its time. Like I am a pretty straight forward person and I know what I want and what I am looking for. So why would I wait 8 dates to know if a guy wants to be exclusive. But than I dont want to come of a pushy or desperate. 
I am talking with a really nice guy, went on a date last night and we had such a great time. We have a second date planned for monday and we are both really looking forward to it. But I dont want to waste my time dating someone who isn‚Äôt looking for something long term, I dont want to be in a relationship like right now, I just want to know if he is open to see where things can go between us. How do you bring something like that up and is a second date too early? I see so many people wasting time or getting led on because of miscommunication and I dont want to get hurt in the end. Can I bring it up in a light way to ask if he is seeing other people or if he wants to see where things can go between us. He asked me last night if he can see me soon so I am not afraid of that.","Asking to be exclusive and asking what someone is looking for are two totally different conversations. It's pretty normal to ask very early on what the other is looking for, even on/before the first date. It's why some dating apps allow you to even list it on your profile."
dating,144kydc,2023-06-08 20:59:49,How to tell him i miss talking on the phone with him?,"So this guy pursued me for two months. We were talking on the phone all the time and whatnot. Then one day he was afraid to tell me something and i forced it out of him. He told me that at the moment he just wants to be friends and that we have a great friendship etc. i was heartbroken cos i started catching feelings for him, but i just acted cool calm and collected when he told me. 

We are still friends and still text almost everyday. I miss him calling me and us talking via phone calls though. I want to tell him but i am scared he will reject me again? What should i do?","""I miss talking to you on the phone"""
dating,144kwk1,2023-06-08 20:57:51,Crush lied about his father being alive,"A recently met a guy who i must say i have been crushing really hard over. He seems to be interested as in he'd come to hangout with me, he asks me on walks etc. (We go to MBA school together)
He was a lawyer so i asked him how he went into the profession. He said it was because of his dad who has his own practice. I jokingly said he must've broken his dad's heart when he said he wasn't interested in the practice. And he said it definitely did & that he tried but it wasn't his thing.
Now i was stalking him online & found an inspirational talk he gave in his college. It was about how he lost his dad to an accident when he was 12 yo.
What should i do? I understand it's a deeply personal space for him. But is this a red flag? Or is it maybe him trying to not kill the fun vibe? Can someone help me understand this? Plus even if i read his signals wrong & maybe he just wants to be friends but why would he lie ?","He didn‚Äôt lie.  He just didn‚Äôt tell you his dad is dead.  And people have been known to have more than one dad‚Ä¶. So one of his dad‚Äôs could‚Äôve died, and another one could‚Äôve been a lawyer.

You recently met him.   I don‚Äôt tell anyone about losing my parents.  My partner and best friend know but I don‚Äôt talk about it freely .  It hurts to talk about.  I don‚Äôt want to talk about it with just anyone anywhere at anytime.  Have some empathy."
dating,144k4w4,2023-06-08 20:29:00,Are you really too busy to text?,"I‚Äôve been seeing this girl for a couple of weeks, and we immediately hit it off. I‚Äôve never clicked with anyone like this before and we share this connection that even with my most serious past relationship I never had. 

After our amazing first date (Friday), she said she wanted to go out again. We went out Saturday, and again SHE said she wanted to see me. 

Fast forward to last weekend, we went out to the movies. When I drove her back to her place, we talked in my car for about an hour before I finally made a move and kissed her. We started making out and it was incredibly passionate. She invited me upstairs where we made love. Not fucked, made love. The foreplay leading up was incredible, we were teasing and caressing each other. When we finally started having sex, it was magical. I can‚Äôt think of any better word to describe it. It was passionate and intense and we locked eyes and maintained eye contact several times. When we finished, we held each other for hours. Touching every inch of each others bodies and holding each other and kissing. She was telling me what she liked about me and her favorite features, and whispering the sweetest things to me. I left in the morning and came back later that night. It was the same thing all over again, we stayed up for hours having sex and talking. The next day we went on a 4hr 5mile hike, stopped at a diner on the way home, and again we had sex and talked and held each other until the sun came up. I had to go to work but she begged me to stay. 

I left a hoodie at her house and she‚Äôs sent me pictures this week of her wearing it, telling me she sleeps in it, tells me she misses me. She mentioned going to  upstate NY next weekend and when I sent her a couple of Airbnb listings, SHE went ahead and booked one for us! Which I wanted to pay her back but we agreed to just take another trip that I‚Äôll pay for!

We video chatted before yesterday for hours and she said she misses me and can‚Äôt wait to see me this weekend. She tells me she‚Äôs crazy about me and feels like we‚Äôve known each other forever. I‚Äôve never felt this strongly about anyone I‚Äôve known for only a couple of weeks! But she‚Äôs so sophisticated and beautiful and kindhearted. And she says all the rights things to make me feel great about myself. She even said she wants to be exclusive and doesn‚Äôt see the need for Bumble anymore.

But for whatever strange reason, she can be a pretty awful tester. We texted yesterday for a little bit in the morning and then I didn‚Äôt hear back from her till 10PM (12hrs later). She sent me a bunch of messages and photos of what she was doing but I was already asleep. 

I responded to her this morning and didn‚Äôt hear back from her till 130PM after I had double texted her asking if she was okay. She just said ‚Äúhey sorry yes I‚Äôm okay! I‚Äôll text you later‚Äù.

She works full time in the city and I know she‚Äôs studying for a certification, but is it possible that someone is THIS busy that they can‚Äôt find 5 seconds to just say ‚Äúhey I‚Äôm busy today, I‚Äôll text you tonight‚Äù? I don‚Äôt want to bring this up to her cause I am NOT gonna start nagging her not even two weeks into a relationship. This makes me feel as though she does not prioritize me or doesn‚Äôt respect me enough to give me the time of day. But at the same time, I feel as though maybe I‚Äôm over reacting because everything else is literally amazing and going great. 

Should I be worried or is she really this busy?","This is kind of backwards. The date is good, the sexual chemistry is good, she literally told you she liked you and stated reasons why, but you‚Äôre worried because she doesn‚Äôt text you back promptly? I would be worried if all those other things weren‚Äôt true. Don‚Äôt shoot yourself in the foot."
dating,144k34n,2023-06-08 20:27:04,"Second date seemed to go really well, then she said she wasn't interested in me romantically.","I may be reading things wrong, but this girl seemed really into me. She was super communicative, and was physically affectionate when we were together. She would stand super close to me on dates and make a lot of eye contact and she laughed at all my stupid jokes. She asked me out on the first and second date, and last night she invited me to her place to hang out. We ended up watching a movie, and she instantly cuddled right up next to me and with her head on my chest and had her legs right up against me and we were cuddling the entire time.

When it was time to leave, we hugged and she leaned in for a kiss, and we made out for a while. We were both into it, and I even tried pulling away bc I really needed to get home as it was getting late, and she wanted to keep going so we did for a bit. This morning I texted her saying it was really nice and invited for to my place this weekend, and I got hit with the ""I'm not romantically interested"".

While we were cuddling, I was rubbing her back and hair and hands. Do girls not like that? Was all this affection just a way of sizing me up and I was reading too much into it as genuine affection?","It‚Äôs hard to say, but from what it sounds like, she was testing the waters and was interested in seeing how good the physical chemistry was, that or she wasn‚Äôt super interested in you romantically somehow. I‚Äôm sorry to hear that she seemed to come out of nowhere with this. Plenty of fish in the sea. Good luck ‚ò∫Ô∏è"

She was hanging out with one of her friends when I first met her. I had gone up to her and her friend, made some conversation with them, and we all seemed to get along well.

We‚Äôve been texting semi-casually until the opportunity came up for me to ask her out. We had been talking about good restaurants around town and when it seemed like we were both into the same one I told her we should go together and check it out.

Then I realised it's not just the men in my life who need to be dragged, loath and have no respect for the profession , I quote my therapist 'Men don't go to Therapy', now I believe that my personal relationships with those men ended as they had no desire to change, didn't think there was anything wrong with them. One of them said, I'm more clever than this man, as I have a PhD in mathematics, he is wrong (our therapist), another one said, you are just one stupid woman wasting your money to listen to another stupid woman (my therapist) all you have to do is listen to me. He had a Master's in engineering. They were both your average good man! Good enough if not amazing in their minds!!! Sounds familiar to anyone???","It's because therapy generally doesn't help men.

It might for trauma, severe trauma or depression.  But what women think men need therapy for, often doesn't work for men. 

We can't just talk about something repetitively and hope for a solution.  Men and women's minds are wired very differently.  That technique works for women. It doesn't for men.

Someone talked about dragging men to therapy. That's another problem. Women think that because it works for them, it's supposed to work for men."

I don't know what to talk nowadays. 
Any tips for a single guy to find a date?",
dating,144hzy5,2023-06-08 19:07:07,How do I know I'm ready to date again and how do I make sure it's healthy? My last relationships were unhealthy and I feel partially responsible. (Very long post. Marked NSFW for caution),"Guess I should do some basic info to start this off: I'm nearly 25 years old, female and I've been out of my last relationship for over a year now since this March. 

I've never really had a 'healthy' relationship, my last relationship lasted three years but it should have ended quite a while before then. It was only my second real relationship so it probably sounds a bit extra to speak of things like that, however I thought I knew what I was doing. 

&#x200B;

To sum these two relationships up that I've had: 

**Relationship 1 (19-20)**

When I was 19, I ended up with a weird 'situation' with a friend's ex. She knew about it, heck she kinda egged it on to begin with. They had dated for a very short time, he had stayed in the friend group and we all hung out one day for a game night. I had never thought of this guy romantically or sexually before this night, our friends made a crap ton of innuendo about us doing things though. We had already planned to watch anime together alone that night, and I guess the game night changed everything. He made a move on me, we messed about and for a week we were 'dating'. 

Should have stopped there, it didn't. He told me he wanted to break up, later that night he took my virginity. For about a year we kept fooling about, I was stupidly convinced he would lose interest if we didn't and he never turned me down. I was admittedly not completely sane during this time and though it was actually kinda mediocre by physical enjoyment standards, I needed the distraction and I liked when he cuddled me afterwards. One time he asked me to sleep over and I agreed, but I couldn't stay the whole night. I felt safe but I couldn't literally sleep in the same bed as someone else. 

**Relationship 2 (20-23)** 

I had no break from that relationship, I kinda moved right into this one with no issue because we weren't actually dating. I met a girl at our university club a while ago and thought 'hey she looks cool' but didn't think much of it until she joined our game nights. We didn't talk much until one day when I was feeling particularly giddy, we joked about and it turned into me being playful and touchy during that night's game. One thing lead to another, we started dating. 

She was a great girl but we were very much wrong for each other. I was a mentally unstable mess to an even worse degree than before, expected way too from her and we were both very dependant on each other. We didn't have sex as much as she wanted and initially I felt guilty because of how much I fooled around with my other ex. I kinda learnt the hard way though that I couldn't force myself to engage when I wasn't mentally feeling it. One thing never changed though, I still couldn't sleep in the same bed as her. I was not super fair to her and health issues eventually got to both of us. We tried to salvage it again and again, eventually we decided to break up. 

&#x200B;

**After the break-up and the actual advice asking part**

I've been single since and trying to get my life together. I had my university graduation around the time of that break up and whilst full-blown therapy hasn't been an option yet, I've been doing self-help courses and I'm on medication for my mental and physical health issues. So I feel a lot more independent and I don't so much as have a panic attack from waiting in a waiting room for a doctor's appointment anymore. I have a job that I hate only half the time, but I'm not completely financially independent because I can't afford to live on my own. I pay rent though, so I don't feel like a complete leech. 

For a while, I've been wanting to start dating again, but I'm always a bit worried. I get scared I'm going to end up in another unhealthy relationship, I worry I might meet someone who is nice and completely understanding and I won't be good enough for them. 

Truthfully, I don't know what a healthy relationship looks like. I have my ideas, but I thought that last relationship was healthy at the time and now I just wonder 'why did I ever let it go on that long'. 

I want to meet a nice guy or girl, and I want to treat them the way they deserve to be treated. I wanna be soft and sappy and be their princess whilst they're my king or queen. I wanna surprise them with little things like their favourite chocolate and have a cuddle from them when either of us is having a bad day. But physical affection doesn't bandage everything and as I learnt the hard way, my body doesn't mean shit. I can't keep a healthy relationship purely on fulfilling their physical needs and deluding myself thinking it's enough. On the other hand I still worry about *not* fulfilling those needs and disappointing them, but it's far too damaging to make myself do it. I guess I'll just have to hope they're patient and don't mind having to wait to mess about.

**How do I know if I'm ready to date again, and how do I make sure I don't make any mistakes and fall into something that's going to hurt me or someone else?**

&#x200B;

*Kinda sorry for how long a post this is, but I wanted to explain as much as possible about why I'm hesitant to date again and why I feel my love life has been a dumpster fire so far. I've had mixed feelings about those past relationships but ultimately they were two-way streets, I'm accountable to some degree for hurting myself.*",

The question is, how you can negotiate them and how much you are allowed to limit your partner's possibilities.

How do I just have fun when the time is right and not expect current person to be the one?,"I have this same issue. I think the first thing you can do is to be concious of this and to know that everybody don‚Äôt feel the same way as you.

I think people like us that have attachment issues have had heavy feelings of loneliness and when a person appears in our life we attach to them very heavy. That can be a red flag for some people, but don‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs bad, its a way of feeling love and attachement and you‚Äôll have to work this to not cross other people limits.

Try some introspection on why you think this happen to you, maybe you think the key to happiness is to find a partner? Maybe you feel stagnant and this makes you feel something? 

I don‚Äôt know what is it for you but as more you know why you feel that way, the more you‚Äôll know how to deal with it.

A short term solution would be when u feel you‚Äôre being too much go to walk or do something you like, play some games, hang out with friends, do sport‚Ä¶

Hope this helps, I feel super identified with this, you‚Äôre not alone :)

dating,144gkqd,2023-06-08 18:11:56,Girl playing games?,"Hello guys!

There's a girl in my class in college, and we've been texting for a while. Initially, she responded to all my texts quickly, then started delaying response time when I subtly began to make my intentions known (just a little bit of flirting here and there, which she seemed to like and find funny).At certain times, she texts/calls me if she doesn't hear from me. 

All of a sudden, she started becoming distant, even replying my messages after a day. It went on for a while and since I hate playing games, I forgot about her and stopped texting and she did same.

She started calling and texting me last week. I pick her calls - which she says is just to check up on me - but scarcely respond to her text and even if I respond, she takes too long to reply. 

She continuously initiates  texts with me, but doesn't reply till the next day, and her response is usually just a word or two.

My question is:
What do you think her motive is?
How should I approach this situation?

I don't want to taint any relationship we have since we're classmates and still have a few months before graduation. 


Ps. I know she's not busy, because she told me she has nothing to do at home (We have a 2-week break).","Don‚Äôt know what her motives are, guessing games aren‚Äôt really useful.

Me? I‚Äôd write her off in a dating sense and not really pay her any mind‚Ä¶If I were to engage I‚Äôd match her energy and just respond platonically whenever I want just to be polite

dating,144fnkd,2023-06-08 17:36:49,Has she (19F) lost interest in me (19M),"Hey everyone,  

So this girl and I (19M) met through college last year, being in the same class for a few subjects. We hit it off as study buddies at first, but gradually started hanging out more often from December last year. Anyhow, we went on multiple hang outs such as ice skating, grabbing lunch, playing golf and tennis etc (touch barrier was broken through holding hands and hugging). After these hang outs, I started to fall for her personality, resulting in me wanting to ask her out on a date.  

I asked her last week in person when we met up to study, but wimped out from directly stating the word 'date' and ended up just saying something like, ""Do you want to do ___ on a Friday after our finals.""  
She responded with a yes, but also stated how we will plan a proper date sometime soon after the exams. To note, her final exams are two weeks after mine, and both her and I massively prioritise our studies over anything else. Anyways, I wanted to clarify that this will be a date and not a hang out so I shot her a text that night to make sure we were both on the same page. However, this is where I'm a little confused as she has left me on delivered and has not responded since (it's now been a week).  
In my past dating experiences I would immediately take this as a rejection, but considering the fact that she genuinely has a very busy scheduled lifestyle and its the final exam period, maybe she will respond once hers is over? At the same time though, I'm sure nobody is that busy. Should I just wait if she responds, and just move on if she doesn't?  

tl:dr, Met a girl through college last year, went on multiple hangouts and asked her out on a date but got left on delivered",
dating,144flv1,2023-06-08 17:35:00,Im nervous about dating again,"Hello. I don‚Äôt know if this is the right place to ask for advice. But I see others have their own issues so I hope this post will be ok.

I‚Äôm wanting to date again but there‚Äôs things holding me back. Firstly, my past. The last two women I was with just completely ruined my life. One cheated and the other made me homeless just to be with someone else she liked. I was so low I ended up on anti depressants and I‚Äôve been diagnosed with PTSD and social anxiety disorder which my GP thinks is linked to it all.

I hate it because it makes me feel like I‚Äôm not normal and less of a man if that makes sense? The worst thing was I put everything into both of those relationships, which to me is the right thing to do, there‚Äôs no point being in a relationship if your not 100% committed. After it all I just got walked over and even today I can‚Äôt think of what I did wrong? I was considerate, always there when needed, supportive, all the things a man should be and what a woman deserves. It put me in the wrong frame of mind in many ways which I won‚Äôt bore you with, but one was thinking every woman is the same (I know they are not) and ‚Äúlove‚Äù simply didn‚Äôt exist anymore. Honestly I still have the same thoughts about love as I haven‚Äôt been proven wrong.

The other thing holding me back is my social anxiety. I never use to but now I find it difficult to be around people I don‚Äôt know. Just talking to someone I‚Äôm finding it difficult to even find something to talk about and I find it seriously frustrating. Others think I‚Äôm being rude or not talkative but that‚Äôs completely not true. And I can‚Äôt explain because no women would want to listen and I doubt some would even try to understand.

I don‚Äôt know what to do. I have a councillor and I even find it difficult to talk to her. I‚Äôm 40 years old and been single for nearly two years, I feel like my life is wasting away and all I want to do is simply settle down with someone and be happy. It‚Äôs not much to ask but it‚Äôs damn near impossible to get. My councillor claims some people don‚Äôt ever get over their anxiety, if I‚Äôm now stuck like this I doubt I‚Äôll ever find anyone, and the thought of going through life alone, honestly it‚Äôs not nice.

Honestly, would you say I should just give up hope? Because from where I sit I can‚Äôt see a way forward with it. It‚Äôs always the nice ones in life that get shat on simply for being a good person. I‚Äôm pretty broken I just don‚Äôt know the best way to go about starting to date again. I don‚Äôt want a repeat of the past.

Thanks for reading my miserable story and I hope it was ok to ask.",

dating,144f6p9,2023-06-08 17:18:38,"I screwed up by being too pushy to get together, but maybe it's for the best?","# Meeting and first dates

I (29m) met a woman (26f) on OkCupid. She's really pretty, and she makes these amazing cosplays. While I don't really have the time nor skills to make my own cosplays, I've always greatly admired them.

I'm definitely an activity-oriented person, and I love doing stuff like board games, amusement parks, and other fun things (well, I think they're fun, at least). So, for dates, I always try to plan an activity, so that if it doesn't work out, at least I had fun with the activity, and it doesn't feel like a wasted night.

For our first date, we went to a brewery where we had drinks, ate pizza, and played board games. The next week, she was too busy to hang out in-person, so we had a video chat. For our second date, we went to a small amusement park where we played mini-golf, did bumper boats, and ate ice cream, before going back to my place where we ate takeout and played her favorite video game that many of her cosplays are based on.

While I really struggle reading people, she seemed into me, and it seemed like she wanted to get together again.

# Planning the third date

She was busy the next week, but we made plans to hang out the Friday after that (two weeks from our second date) when we were both off from work. I was going to cook her dinner, and we would play more her favorite video game. The only snag was that she didn't yet know what time she was coming. As a meticulous planner, this really bothered me, but I decided to let it go, since at least I knew the day she was coming.

It wasn't until the day before (Thursday) that she told me she was driving her dad to the doctor at about 3:30p, and she wouldn't be available until that was done. While I was disappointed that she wouldn't be coming until late (I thought we would spend the whole day together), I am family-oriented, and I know the importance of helping family, so I told her I totally understood.

When Friday came, the forecast said there was going to be thunderstorms, so she said she didn't feel comfortable driving to me. I was really disappointed, but she said we could still video chat. So, I put the chicken I had defrosted for her into the fridge, and we hopped on a video call.

She was working the next day (Saturday) until about noon, and then on Sunday she was going to an art museum with her friends. I asked if she wanted to come over after work on Saturday, where I could cook her that meal I had promised, and she said she would see if she was too tired or not.

When I reached out to her the next day, she said she was too tired to come over. I expressed sympathy, but I really wanted to see her, so I asked what time she was coming back from the museum the next day.

And I never heard from her again.

# Thoughts and reflection

I reached out late on Wednesday to say ""Hi"", but she never got back to me. It looks like I was being too pushy about hanging out, and I scared her off. But, maybe this is for the best? I am a meticulous planner, and while I'm definitely an introvert, I like to go out and do fun things with people. While I enjoy the planning process, and I'm totally fine doing all of the planning myself, all I ask in return is that I get a date and time when they are available, and she couldn't even do that.

Maybe I'm just crazy, and people are never going to be willing to make plans. Maybe I'm right, and asking for a date and time to hang out is reasonable. Maybe getting together in-person at least once every two weeks is unreasonable, especially when you've only gone on two in-person dates? What does everyone think? Should I just lower my expectations of planning (especially that early in a relationship), or should I try to find someone who can make that kind of commitment? Is there something I need to work on about myself?

**Note**: This is an edited version of the original I wrote that was around 1,300+ words long (this is about 700 words long). I tried to cut it down so it is not too long while still explaining the important points, but if anyone thinks I should post the long version, please let me know!","Hmm idk, I like planning things too. I think u r fine, she just wasn‚Äôt interested.

I get tired easily but every weekend I would spend a day with the guy I‚Äôm dating and even drive all the way to him if he was really busy. If u like a person you‚Äôll make time for them.

I would say that u don‚Äôt need to go all out on the first couple dates. Play it by the mood. My ex and I had our first date planned to be ice cream but we ended up having lunch and I got home at 10 pm. After that we would spend 2 pm - 12 am on date days.

dating,144e3eo,2023-06-08 16:37:07,The dating proces has made me stop believing in love...,"I don't think I believe in love. And at most I believe it exists for others, but not for me. It's not that I don't want to believe in love, it's just that all previous experiences for me have been very disappointing. 

Every time I allow myself to start believing it might be possible when it is going well with a guy, it turns to shit. I know dating is about finding the right person at the right time and so many things have to align for it to work. But at the same time, it seems to align pretty easily for others. 

I do tend to be a true romantic at heart which doesn't really help with the disappointment as it hits even harder. I really want to find love. But maybe it doesn't exist and I am just setting myself up for failure? When I say I don't believe in love, I also know it's a lot of fear talking. I don't know when I became such a cynic, but I am. I feel like such a bitter person sometimes and I wish I wasn't, but it's like I can't help it. 

Nobody has ever loved me or given me a chance. And to make matters worse. There was never a reason. I even got, I really like you and I felt something, but then it all went to shit and they started ignoring me. So yeah.... trust shattered. I guess I wonder how other people keep believing in it? Maybe because you felt loved before so you know it exists? I have never felt that. Nobody has ever told me they loved me and maybe nobody will ever say that to me. 

How do I start believing in love again?",My marriage and long term relationship has made me stop believing in love.

dating,144e0hs,2023-06-08 16:34:03,Why are scammers the only people I match with,"I‚Äôm 22m. I‚Äôve been on dating sites off and on since I turned 18. When I first got on it was discouraging that no one matched with me. I‚Äôd go weeks and weeks without a right swipe and I lived (and currently live) in a college town. To be fair I wasn‚Äôt in the best of shape back then.

I took a break pretty much from when I turned 19 to now. I had spent a couple years working manual labor (warehouses) and I was feeling super confident about where my body was when I started getting matches. Nothing crazy. Maybe 2 since last week but that‚Äôs 2 more than I ever got 4 years ago. 

The first one was Tinder. We talked for like an hour on the app and it seemed like we were looking for the same thing, an NSA hookup. Then she added me on snap and halfway to her place (a 30 minute drive) all of the sudden she wants $80 for an hour. And I‚Äôm willing to admit, while it isn‚Äôt something I‚Äôd usually do I sent her the first $40. I pull up to her place and then she sends me a snap telling me to ‚Äútalk to her manager‚Äù so I added her. The manager then tells me she needs a $500 security fee. Needless to say I left. Other than this I‚Äôve had 0 likes on tinder. 

After that I downloaded Adult Friend Finder because I‚Äôd heard it was good for the kind of relationship I‚Äôm looking for rn. Chatted with a girl I met on there on Instagram and after making plans to meet up she told me I‚Äôd need to get some ‚Äúsafety merit badge‚Äù. I looked at the link she sent me and it looks like a scam. I mean they‚Äôll photoshop your face and birthday onto a card and make outrageous claims like you‚Äôre HIV negative with no more info than your name and cell phone. I told her I‚Äôd pay for a real background check if safety was her concern and she got mad, claimed I was a sex offender, and told me no one would meet up with me without this specific badge from the site she sent me. When I said no she told me she‚Äôd ‚Äúcontact the admin‚Äù. So I blocked her. 

Is this happening because I‚Äôm being so transparent about only wanting NSA in my bio?",So sad

I am a M/ 26 years old. I recently started dating a new lady a few weeks ago. It was really unexpected and strange it felt like fireworks I thought we had dynamic chemistry.

We had been on about 3 dates but in between those dates we would switch off and stay at one another‚Äôs house on the weekends, and we hooked up quite a bit.

She even took imitative and planned on of the dates.This lady even already gave me a nickname, introduced me to all of her coworkers, and the first night we met told me that she could see her self marrying me.

On my side, I had mentioned to her that I do see potential in the relationship. And I would 100% would want to ask her to be my girlfriends if things continued going as well as they were.

This lady is a medical tech and works night shifts. She had to work 3 days in a row so I hadn‚Äôt heard much from her. I did not think much about it since I understand that grind and I‚Äôm not much of a text person myself. Anyways yesterday after knowing my grandfather died the day before she decides to tell me that she is overwhelmed and that this was all too much for her.

I responded with the typical no worries. And she said she would reach out to me next week to talk.

My question is for all of you with the context should I just cut this girl off? Or should I maybe wait to see if she reaches out and take things from there? ( if she even reaches out this seems like she was letting me down nicely)",

She told me over text that I roll over and show my belly too much and she was into bad guys. But she has also told me she likes me a lot and wants to make out and stuff. I have no experience when it comes to women or relationships in general. Is this red flag material? Or is it just my self sabotaging behavior making an appearance trying to tell me I'm better off alone and there is no one for me out there? Because that is how I am feeling right now.,"She's telling you to be more persistent.

To go for what you want in this relationship.

Stop being so passive.

It may not work out, but it seems like she's rooting for you, my man.

Stop overthinking this, and do what comes naturally.

Women don't want bad boys. They want good men who are confident and badasses.

Am I being self destructive?,"I've (30M) been seeing this girl (28F) about 8 weeks now and while we are not exclusive we've had this discussion and that's where things are headed. However, I know this whole time she has been seeing and talking to this other guy but not spending as much time with him as she is with me. 

This kind of bothers me because I feel like she hasn't fully committed to being exclusive with me yet because she's waiting on the other guy to make a move. I've already told her I'm ready to take the next step so she knows where I'm at. 

She told a mutual friend a few days ago she was going to make it official with me soon but then I find out she's meeting up with the other guy today after we spent last night together. 

Am I being irrational for wanting to tell her she has to decide now otherwise I'm going to move on?",Maybe she wanted to let him know in person it was over? Or maybe you really are just the backup/safe option. I'd just tell her she needs to make up her mind or you're going to move on.

We have been dating for 6 months so it‚Äôs still a pretty new relationship. He is busy with his last semester of school and I try and fill up my week with work to keep myself busy too. I just seem to get upset and annoyed when we can‚Äôt see each other as much as I‚Äôd like to. I don‚Äôt normally tell him if I‚Äôm annoyed because I get upset at dumb shit. Stuff I shouldn‚Äôt be annoyed at. So I try and take time to calm down or distract myself. We also have different love languages. Mine is 100% gift giving and having time together. So I feel like I get him little things here and there and do cute stuff for him (not expensive) and I don‚Äôt get anything ever. I mean he buys me food but you know every girl wants something small here and there. That also drives me crazy. But other than that everything is going great I feel like my brain is the problem.

dating,144bbcw,2023-06-08 14:49:42,please share advice and thoughts on casually dating multiple people.,"I have decided I want to make an effort at mindfully dating around and not jumping into anything serious.  

I have been in several multi-year relationships and just want to try and be more sure about the next relationship before investing into that with someone. 

The primary reasons is that I really want to find a life-partner and a relationship that lasts.  And I don't want to waste my time time or that of other's on anything that doesn't have real potential to last more than 2-3 years.  

I know this is not necessarily ever known for sure, but in past relationships I know I at least was less sure than I could have been and I now know much better what I am looking for and how I can be a better partner.  

Anyways, since this is sort of new to me I am asking for advice and thoughts.  

My primary concerns are keeping things casual while also testing compatability and getting to know someone.  I know communication and being on the same page is key.  

But also, the more time you spend with someone the more intimate things naturally likely become - how to continue seeing that person if you are still not ready for a serious commitment. 

At some point I suppose you must make that judgement that if you are still unsure that it may likely not be a good match. But there is one person for example who has been on the same page but things start to feel more intimate than the casual dating label might suggest.  

Idk exactly what I""m asking but hope I've described my thoughts and concerns well.  Appreciate your input.","Set very, very clear boundaries and make sure to communicate your intentions. If you‚Äôre confused, ask questions because assumptions, second-guessing and ‚Äúreading people‚Äù won‚Äôt give you answers. It‚Äôll give you false hope and unwarranted expectations."
dating,144bawp,2023-06-08 14:49:10,"[M26] Great Tinder date, but unsure about her interest. Advice appreciated","Hey everyone,

I'm a 26-year-old guy who recently had a fantastic Tinder date with a 23-year-old girl last Monday. We matched on the app and spent about a month chatting before deciding to meet in person.

I had an amazing time during the date. We enjoyed some drinks and food together, and as I live in a different town, we walked back to the train station when it was time to say goodbye.

We shared a goodbye kiss, and I mentioned that we should definitely plan to do this again sometime.

However, since then, I haven't received any response from her. The last message I sent was on Monday, just to let her know that I arrived home safely and wished her the same.

I'm feeling a bit uncertain about where things stand. Could it be that she's just busy or not interested anymore? I'd appreciate some advice on how to proceed. Should I wait a bit longer or reach out again to see if she's still interested?

Thanks in advance for your help!","Honestly not interested, I have had that happen a few times and it just confused me why it seemed great then no answer but she could be seeing more guys and just likes one better. Anyway goodluck"
dating,144axj4,2023-06-08 14:34:01,I 26M want to break up with my girlfriend 26F but it seems like a bad time.,"Long story short, I 26M just can‚Äôt handle the stress of my relationship 26F any more and I know that I need to break up with her. My life is way more stressful than it was before we started dating and I can‚Äôt keep living this way. The dilemma I‚Äôm facing is that we are supposed to go to the beach with her family tomorrow night or Saturday morning. I really don‚Äôt want to go at all but I feel like it‚Äôs a bad time to break up with her cause she would go on vacation with a broken heart. I know there is no good time to end things, but I don‚Äôt know if I should just suck it up and go or end it tonight when I see her. My mother says it would be cruel to break up with her before her vacation and go with a broken heart, so I‚Äôm torn. Advice would be great!

TLDR; I want to break up with my girlfriend but we are going on vacation with her family this weekend and I feel stuck.","It's gonna suck anytime. But perhaps there is a way you can get out of going on the vacation yourself - like sudden ""gastro"" or a work thing or a 'family member X really needs you to help with this thing that came up' - and breaking up once it's over. So then you have some distance from her, while allowing her to enjoy her vacation. I'm sure that's a bit of a grey area ethically, but it might be a compromise.

Otherwise, break up now. It sounds like you're fit to burst and you're gonna end up blurting it out ON the vacation. And that's gonna be unforgettable."

dating,144ab5h,2023-06-08 14:08:47,Change approach to dating/relationships?,"Currently in college 21M and went on about 7 dates total this year half from hinge/half from school.  I feel like learned so much along the way about myself, what I'm looking for so regardless of what's happened i've improved a lot. 

With that being said there's a bit of a trend here with girls and rejection. But I figured I could ask here and maybe get some help! 

One thing I wanted to ask here is about potentially changing my overall approach:

I have a bit more of an eccentric happy go personality. The problem I'm thinking that's occurring is that most of the girls i'm seeing see this as  sweet gay male friend which isn't exactly what they want. I am bi so sometimes I can give off not fully straight energy which might be off putting to the general female population.

I do still make very intentional attempts to show I'm interested through flirting physically and with words too but it might be too much? 

Is this a case of keep being who you are and someone good will come eventually or do I make efforts to just tone it down a bit, establish that I'm not uninterested/gay friend e.g through kissing, sex etc. then open up a bit more as we go so as to not confuse them at the beginning?

hopefully that makes sense thanks for the help","Keeping your mouth shut is a sure way to attract girls, seriously. Be good at conversations but keep your mouth shut. I used to speak a lot when in college and than shit things happen last few yrs and I stop talking a lot lol, turns out in my favor. Girls just dig it. 
When you are with a girl, joke about sex, their sexuality, how they have fun, don‚Äôt talk about other bois you will definitely be a gay lol, touch, I have a habit of going straight for thighs haha. And looking at the boobs, they know, they notice and they will joke on your face. 
Be a lil bit stern so you don‚Äôt come off as gay. 
Don‚Äôt be coxky. Don‚Äôt jump around a lot, you are not chimpanzee."
dating,144a77y,2023-06-08 14:04:28,"Men, do you ever regret losing someone who was good to you?","I recently have been reflecting back on a past relationship and wondering if they regret taking me for granted. I know I was really caring and supportive towards him. He would randomly tell me how my love was felt everyday. However, he had attachment issues and tended to self sabotage the relationship. A few days ago, a friend of mine was venting to me about how he screwed up with someone he liked and how he realized when she was gone, how much of a supportive person she was. And I guess I just want to know if this is a common thing? Or if anyone else has a similar story. We‚Äôre you just not ready for a good woman at the time? And what exactly made you regret it?

EDIT: This question is meant for men who have considered to have had a good woman in their life. Not to bash women or a woman because you‚Äôve only had bad experiences.","My ex and I split up because we were different people. He wanted polyamory, I didn't, and it broke us up. A few years later, when I was willing to try friendship and we'd healed, he mentioned that the first few months, he felt like he was drowning trying to re adjust his entire life. He didn't realize how many small things I did that made his day run more smoothly or the ways he relied on me that I never made a big deal out of. 




My great grandmother called the way I love ""Fairy Love"". When you take the time to know your partner in little ways and try to improve little things. 





My current fiance notices and appreciates the things I do. I wake up early even though I could sleep in to braid his hair, I make his coffee some mornings, if there's a towel in the dryer I'll run it so that he can have the warmest towel or warm blankets before bed occasionally and where my other partner would never notice I watch my fiance melt when I do these things for him. In the end hon, it doesn't matter if they miss it. What matters is that they didn't appreciate it when you were doing it for them. Find someone who does."

It feels like he tries to avoid me in school and he doesn‚Äôt even try to talk to me. He‚Äôs like a different person almost. 

My class was on a field trip yesterday. We did different activities, but every time I tried to go up to my boyfriend to talk to him he always does something else. So lunch rolls around and we are eating. I finally have the chance to talk to him and we only talk for 10 min. So i says: I‚Äôve been wanting to talk to you all day, but every time I go to talk to you, you‚Äôre doing something else. And he replies with: I was absolutely not gonna go do that. I‚Äôm feeling kinda hurt but I tell him: You can go do what you want. So he nods his head and leaves.

Today we had another field trip but different, my class and his class weren‚Äôt interacting at all. But I saw him at the end and we were gonna hang out today, but he left me for his guy friends.

At this point I would just let it go and put it out of my mind if I were you. Think of all the reasons to do so:

1. He's leaving in 3 weeks anyway and there's no future to this situationship. It sounds like he's already pulling away and holding onto this will only erode your self esteem. I've been there.

2. In your other post it seems like he was talking about you with his friends in their language? And was upset with you after? Insisting that you stay over and sleeping with you but everything was ""off"", most likely he just wanted to hook up one last time and leave it at that.

3. There's no rule of thumb to an ""acceptable way"" to end a relationship or situationship. People do what they want, and sometimes it's shitty. If he's leaving for good then it's likely easier for him to just not follow up with any contact at all.

So yeah, try to occupy yourself in the next while and do your best to just forget about this dude, whether he reaches out or not should no longer be your concern at this point and should be of no consequence to you whatsoever. Hope this makes sense!"

At this point I feel fine I suppose. I‚Äôm productive at work, have been more active socially and am able to take care of my business, but dating to me just doesn‚Äôt seem viable right now.

For more context, I just moved back to the city I call home, which is one of the largest metropolitan areas in the country, if not the biggest after being abroad for awhile and was very eager to get out there. In my first week I was seeing a lot of success, but then got the call about my dad.

On top of that, I decided to mostly give up drinking as my father was an alcoholic and I have had some issues with binge drinking, so it felt right. 

Now it just feels weird to me to go on dating. A major event just took place in my life and I made a major lifestyle change and I still don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm ready. 

So my question for you all, when did you feel ready and when did you start getting out there again?",The only correct answer here is to date when YOU feel like it‚Äôs time . You will know when you‚Äôre ready . I‚Äôm sorry for your loss & congratulations on quitting drinking ! ‚ú®üôèüèº
dating,1448fq7,2023-06-08 12:51:03,I feel confused about what the hell is happening or what this guy even wants from me.,"So I've been training at the same gym for over 1.5 years. This guy who I thought had no interest in me recently approached me and is obviously try to chat me up and it turns out he is moving in a few weeks. He seemed fun and flirty and I am looking to dip my toe into dating. He'd always come hang out in groups when he finds out I am there in the past month. 

The sexual tension you could cut with a knife, one of his friends kept joking that maybe we can fall in love so that he can stay in town. He came to this giant dinner unexpectedly and told me he wanted to spend more time with me. He stayed by me all night and we talked. He offered to drive me alone to the second location. There would be little accidental grazes and we would have some really good conversations in the car. I thought maybe he wanted to hook up.

But then when he drove me home, we got into this deep conversation that lasted over an hour. He was like in near tears talking about how he rarely finds a spark in women that he likes and he sees this spark in me. I was put off by it because I thought he was idealizing me and I told him you really don't know me. We end the night where he got out of the car to give me an awkward hug, I thought he was going to make a move but didn't. I was going to make the move but the hug was so quick.

Then before he leaves he says he wants to see me before he leaves but then starts to slow ghost me. Kept giving vague answers about when this hang out would be. My other friends think he accidentally caught feelings and felt awkward about the car talk. I wanted to make him feel less awkward so I did text him saying that I may have not reacted in the best way to him opening up and it's been hard for me to open up to people I don't know well. He really appreciated how honest I am and liked spending time with me.

Then recently he started texting me normal conversation stuff to tell me about his move but suddenly it just stops mid convo completely after asking me a question about my life. I am so confused on what he even wants from me. Was he after a hookup? I kind of resent that he just dropped into my life before he left and now does not even seem to want to be friends. Like what was even the point of all that? We all belong to a group at the gym. None of the guys know what happened and think we had a thing but like nothing happened at all.","Sounds like a guy who....

\- Has no game  
\- Has got a few personal issues  
\- Lacks confidence

....and when he made a tit of himself in-front of you, he was suffering from embarrassment (hence the slow ghosting). 

So yeah, just sounds like a really socially awkward guy. You get them sometimes. 

If he's moving town anyway, you could just let it be and forget the whole thing even happened. Because I'm pretty sure that if you began dating him, it wouldn't be long before you stopped feeling attracted to him."
dating,1447yw8,2023-06-08 12:30:37,Should I give a nice guy a chance?,"So I met this really nice guy via Tinder and we went for one date. He is not bad looking at all and there were a lot of points we connected over, but I just don't feel instant attraction that I felt when I met the people I dated in the past. Like, there were dates in the past where I instantly knew that I was attracted and could easily imagine myself getting physical with the guy, but this is, unfortunately, not the case. Should I trust my gut and don't waste his time or should I try to know him more to see if my feelings are going to change?",">Should I trust my gut and don't waste his time

This is exactly what you should do.

dating,1447ms8,2023-06-08 12:14:59,"""I'm not ready for a relationship right now""","I (M) talked to this girl on Hinge for about a week and met up a couple days ago. Conversation was great, she was super cute, I got her number and we moved off-app pretty quickly, and she confirmed with me before the date that we were both looking for the same thing: a long-term relationship.

&#x200B;

The date was amazing. One of the best I've ever been on. We talked about so many things and the vibe the whole time was really fun and flirty. We were making plans to meet up later in the week and everything seemed to be going really well. She seemed like a really honest and genuine person and we talked about a lot of things that I wouldn't expect to talk about on the first date. We got dinner, walked around the town, made out on a bench. I walked her back to her car with plans to meet up at her place the next day. She texted me when she got home and thanked me for a great night.

&#x200B;

She texted me good morning the next day. Things were continuing much as they had before the date. She said she had a headache after work and wanted to take a nap, and I had no reason not to believe her. She texted me a few hours later saying she was feeling better, so I asked what her plans were for the evening, expecting her to invite me over. Instead, she said she had a great time last night but realized she isn't looking to date. She assured me it's not me, she just isn't ready for a relationship right now.

&#x200B;

I was really blindsided by this and I've been hurt and confused since she told me. I haven't gotten this many green flags from a date in a long time, and we had great chemistry in person. I just can't wrap my head around it. I know she either isn't into me, which doesn't make sense to me given the vibe on the date, or she's seeing someone else and didn't want to tell me, which could make sense. Or she's telling the truth. Maybe she's just scared of commitment.

&#x200B;

I know there's nothing I could have done to change her mind, and I don't think there's anything I would have done differently. It's just really frustrating and confusing to have that kind of chemistry in person and get nothing but green flags for the whole night into most of the next day only for her to change her mind. I know it was literally one date, but I hadn't felt this way about anyone in a long time. I guess I appreciate her letting me know instead of ghosting me. I'm going to take a break from dating for awhile, and I'm sure I'll feel better given a bit of time, but this whole situation is really frustrating and confusing. I wish her all the best and I hope she finds happiness in whatever way she needs, but I really thought we could have had that together. It feels like I'm setting myself up for failure when I get excited about dates at all anymore, because there's a chance of something like this happening. It just sucks man",When a girl says they‚Äôre not ready for a relationship it usually means they‚Äôre not ready for a relationship‚Ä¶ WITH YOU.  Just their way of letting you down easy.
dating,1447iim,2023-06-08 12:09:16,Confession,"I want apologize first off to my superwoman and kids and then to everyone who I mislead including myself. This comes from the heart, so my words are real. Im glad none of you took me serious enough to actually meet cause you would have meet someone else that would have been bad. Im not a bad person but a person put in a heartbroken situation and feeling like the only way I could get the pain off me was to hand it to someone else. So when my family left me I went into a rage. But two days ago I found out some thing's that tortured my soul. But I didn't react negatively, I reacted with a smile and positive words. The mother of my kids really hates me. And after looking at it can't blame her. Although I never cheated on her I did something worse. I missed the birth of my daughter because I was to afraid to stand up for myself and walk away so I played into the game and lost. Now here I was again. Without the only woman in the world who gave me peace. I can't do it again. I won't do it again. I won't continue to live a lie like im not hurt, or miss her, or wish that I could somehow repair and get back everything I lost but I can't. But i felt I needed to release this balled up energy of pain that I've been giving a lot of people because of the action I've made.. No one deserves that. Losing someone you love more than anything in the world is a different feeling than losing a friend. I lost that and that pain and torture became my temple. Although I won't say things to incriminate myself just know that if I didn't have it and they, ya was was a target because nothing was more important than them having it and me seeing a smile on they face. I haven't been sexually active since September of 2021. I wish she just  knew how much I miss them and how my world was rocked. But today is my first step. Being honest ...baby mama if your out there , I promise to love, protect, nurture, and provide with every ounce of me. I've made mistakes and I manned up to them. But on my kids I've never cheated on you, will never cheat and never thought about cheating. After seeing the things I saw and hearing your words to me and seeing the prayer that my baby constantly sends to God I know I must change. She's the mother of children the queen of my empire. God I am sorry for the lies and pain I caused people because of my pain. I can't deceive another person, I won't deceive another person. Im created for one person and you've shown me who that was long ago, just being without my right hand made me go into a great depression and didn't care who was hurt as long as they got it when they needed it.  You know my heart lord and I know this is why my faith and prayers and manifestations wasn't coming to life. Im leaving all social media knowingly and unknowingly. My focus is back on being the greatest father ever, the male I could be and hopefully winning spouse comeback of the year lol.. you said all things are possible if we trust in you wholeheartedly. This was my first step to showing that im committed to to getting them back regardless. This is the real me no hidden cameras no hidden faces no nothing. Just the real me from here on out. I know im going to be tested but I will prove to them all that nothing in this world means more to me then to be back in the presence of my superwoman and kids. I just wish one day she would text and say hello. Just to let me know that someone is in my corner even if it's a silent corner. Thank you guys for listening and again I do apologize. Signing out.. 
Long Road To Home","I was the original creator of this point. I thought by coming here to release the bad energy and pick up some good ones would do me some good. Well I guess the spirit word heard me. I woke up refreshed and full of energy and even seen a bank transaction that was posted to my account of the funds stolen. Yesterday on my continued journey I stopped and picked up my lab work after taking my girls to see if they needed up to date shots and things. Lab work and hair follicle drug test results came in. Well I passed both. So now this is my new confession, I still can't for the love of me comb my daughters hair and I can't get my baby to stop asking God this same one prayer she wants. When I tell her to stop saying it she cries. She tells me, you said I can ask God for anything. I won't ever stop her happiness or tell her she can't dream. Now in the transition phase to move , I can't lie im a bit afraid"
dating,1447gn8,2023-06-08 12:06:45,What should I do now after two dates and a cold text reply afterwards?,"Guys, what‚Äôs the best move I should make next?

I(28m)‚Äôve been on two dates with a girl(25f). First date went well, we had great chat and we kissed. Second date was even better, spent 3.5 hours in a bar(went to get a bit of food in between), we made out like 10 times passionately, we held hands, bantered and laughed a lot. I walked her to the bus stop and we kissed a few times before her bus arrived. She comes to my city for work 2 days-ish a week but she‚Äôll move here fully soon.

After the date I texted her 2 hours later asked if she got home ok and she said she did. We haven‚Äôt had sex yet.

* about our communication

She has never initiated any text convo unless it‚Äôs date related.

There were 14 days between our first date and our second date, we only texted a few times all related to the second date I initiated, she gladly said yes and told me when she‚Äôs free. We had very handful small talk in between.

We are not texting regularly. It seems like she‚Äôs not always on social media as she doesn‚Äôt have many pictures on Instagram and doesn‚Äôt post story.

The question is:

After I said ‚ÄòI had a great time yesterday, let‚Äôs do this again‚Äô, she tapped likes on the message and didn‚Äôt reply, which was on yesterday morning.

What should I do? Shall I ask her out again soon? I‚Äôm feeling a bit like our effort is imbalanced. Briefly mentioned making her food and cocktail so I might consider asking her coming over as well. She is enthusiastic when we meet though. She doesn't initiate physical touch, which I do all the time.

PS. Not sure if this matters, she‚Äôs a local in this country and I‚Äôm an expat, English is her first language and it‚Äôs not for me.



Updates: I asked her out last Friday, read my message and no reply. Until 3 days later she said ‚Äòsorry thought I replied, shall we do xxx on Thursday?‚Äô

I never really thought about this but is this usually the case?

\- desperate and don't have options, still have feelings for the other person, or the sex was just that good

For those that have been offered or asked to do fwb what was the reason for it?","I don't think it means she has no options. Of course she can have sex with other guys.

Although we aren't dating I think down the line there is a possibility that we will end up dating. With this in mind should i bother with online dating?

edit: So i did use online dating before. I had decent success with online dating as that is how I met my ex. Got an ok amount of dates with different girls from the short time i used it. It's just that i found online dating pretty time consuming and meeting new people was draining. I've also noticed that it's a lot harder to find compatible people from online dating. For example with my ex she was a sweet girl it was just that i found out we were so different, her values were really different from mine, her sense of humor was different from mien so in the end i had to break up with her since i didn't see us going long term

This is actually why i want to date my best friend. I've notice when ur friends with someone u are friends with them because u share similar values and sense of humor",Don't put your eggs in one basket. Date around.

I know that it‚Äôs not short or anything but I was just curious how much my height would limit the range of girls that would be okay with it.

She's clearly into me. We always have good chat. She's touchy and makes eye contact. She laughs at my jokes and always hits me playfully.

We have chemistry. She's nice and attractive ENOUGH.

BUT I'm just not really feeling it. I could ask her to get a drink really easily, but I just know she's not the one.

Maybe we're too similar, maybe I'm not THAT attracted to her. I just know I don't want to be in a relationship with her.

We could hook up, but I'll see her again and run into her eventually.

We're instagram friends and she comments on my stories every once in a while. Sometimes she asks questions and I just answer them without asking anything back. Again, really easy to say ""hey, let's get a drink,"" but I don't and that's a sign.

So I guess we can't really be friends and I've friendzoned her?? There's a good chance she feels the same way about me, which is why she's not proposing activities and she's just slightly more outgoing than I am.

Anyway, I didn't say anything about this specifcally. But a few weeks ago I said ""are you real about me? Are you only seeing me? Because I have the feeling and almost know for sure you're seeing other women"". He denied this.

He went home and things were different. He started to ignore my texts and after 2 weeks we meet up again. He said ""I ignore you, because you blame me for meeting other women. I know you never trusted me, and that's okay. Maybe we should stop with our relationship, because you stress me out"".

I wanted to have a full conversation about him on these apps, but as soon as he said I stress him out and so on..I felt like I was the one to blame for all of this.Do I stress him out by asking the truth?

It's such a mindfuck and I feel kind of depressed of this situation. The lying, when I asked him. Now I'm the one to blame.

I found out he has been doing this our whole relationship, for 2 years long....

He doesnt use his real name on the app. It's like he wants to be undercover. Only photos with sunglasses and he's acting like he lives in a different city","Since you have proof you don't need anything else. It doesnt matter if he's denying it, the proof you have is everything you needed, since you feel like he's lying and there is no trust in general then it's better that you broke up.

dating,1441mb5,2023-06-08 06:41:01,Boyfriend cheated,"I (31) am awake, and my boyfriend (42) of 2 years was using his phone to cast Netflix to the tv. He fell asleep, the tv asked if we‚Äôre to continue watching so I opened his phone to say yes. 

I have known his password for maybe a year but in the initial stage of our rship, I had told him I trust him and will never search his phone and I didn‚Äôt expect him to search mine aswel. If he  does have to use my phone I hand it to him freely and he does the same, in fact he was the one who told me his password.

Anyways, upon telling Netflix to continue playing , I decided to search his phone. Which is a promise I broke. But to my surpised I found a conversation of him speaking to someone on Jan 9, the conversation had been building over a few days it seems and on Jan 9, it progressed to them meeting up to have sex. It mentioned up to the very point where my boyfriend told the person that he was on the way, what road he was turning on and that he has arrived and  outside, the person said their pu*ssy was wet and waiting. My boyfriend explicitly said he was going to Fck the person raw and pump his load in the person. 

The only message after that was the person saying ‚ÄúI take it you didn‚Äôt enjoy that as much as I did‚Äù. I gather that is because nothing was said after the meet and the number is now blocked. 

I don‚Äôt know how to proceed because the way I found out is me breaking his trust as well.

dating,1441llc,2023-06-08 06:40:01,Still reeling from his ex üôÅ,"
Hi everyone. I need advice. 

I have been friends with a guy for a while through both of our daughters been best friends since kindergarten. They are now in fourth grade about to be in fifth. When I first met me, no boyfriend, he was from what I thought, happily married to his wife, and his daughter, who it happens to be my daughters, best friend.
Going over there to drop off my daughter and get to know them, I came to find out that his wife was having an affair with a guy, and actually bring him over to the house, while the play dates were happening and the husband would leave knowing this. I was mind blowing. I couldn‚Äôt understand why he wouldn‚Äôt stand up and at least all them to do their shenanigans outside of his own home. Moving forward, she ends up, marrying the guy and moving on with her life. I got out of a toxic relationship and wanted to be single for a while. All the while, for about a year to my nail boyfriend was pursuing me very hard. I decided finally to give him being that I knew he was a good dad, a good guy, a good career and house, and was tired of toxic men so I gave it a go. In the beginning, he would take me shopping, etc. etc. to try to impress me. All the while, as I was trying to get to know him. Overtime, I realize that most conversations would lead to his ex wife. It seem like he would start taking me or was taking me to the places they had been together. We talked about moving on in the future, but he still wants to remain in the same house him and his wife purchase together. I feel like that house has lots of that energy being that she cheated on him in that home as well. I want to start fresh with someone and my dream is to buy a home with my future person. He was talking me into, perhaps building onto the house for my children so that we could all fit together but still, he won‚Äôt let go of it. Here‚Äôs a catch, when they first broke up three years ago, they would exchange the children every Wednesday and have dinner together as a temporary thing for the kids to get on with the divorce. It‚Äôs been three of us for years now, and they are still meeting every Wednesday for dinner. Most of the time they meet for dinner and have a glass or bottle of wine or two and talk about more than just the kids. It ends up becoming a two or three hour session. He‚Äôs inviting me to it to prove to me that nothing was going on, but the whole time he was just talking to his wife about their kids, ignoring her husband, and I, or her husband was making comments about finally getting to bed and hits for James to finally leave. it seemed as though he was overstaying his welcome. I cannot do every Wednesday with him as I have a life of my own. He promised me that these Wednesdays would eventually evaporate, and he would be spending time with me, but it hasn‚Äôt happened yet. I definitely feel like I am at the point where it‚Äôs either me and spending more time with me or him and his ex and their past relationship. I‚Äôve told him this a few times, but I‚Äôm ready to really let things go. Should I stay with this guy because he‚Äôs a great guy and maybe down the road things will get better? We don‚Äôt spend any time during the week together and he and I only get together on weekends or with the kids, we rarely get date nights or selves, maybe every other weekend, so it makes your every day evenings like cooking dinner together and having wine and talking about your week literally nonexistent. Is it just me or does he have a very unhealthy connection to his ex wife? I‚Äôm trying to support the idea of coparenting which I do, but it seems a bit excessive. They talk every day about the kids and I really don‚Äôt feel like I have much room to start a relationship with him and my kids.",Just because someone is a great guy doesn't make them a great partner - or a great partner *to you*.

dating,1441ij6,2023-06-08 06:34:53,What is the Japanese dating culture,"Hello everyone, I, 22F am currently on vacation in Japan, and almost two days ago I happened to get talking to a local guy my age. He‚Äôs not my usual type at all, but we got along wonderfully. We have alot in common. He‚Äôs also got great English and has lived previously for a long time in my home country. We have exchanged phone numbers for photography purposes (as we are both photographers). Since then, we haven‚Äôt really spoke. He has asked me about my social media‚Äôs to see more work‚Ä¶ but that‚Äôs as far as we have communicated since. I do find that I have been thinking about him. Not sure completely why. But part of me would like to see him again. We stopped doing our Photography and just sat for hours instead talking, and went on a beautiful walk. I felt like I had known him for much longer than mere hours. 

I am wondering if wires have been crossed culturally. Perhaps I have taken this differently to how he has. Or our cultural styles of romance are different. I would love if someone could tell me more about the Japanese dating culture and how it works. ~ Many thanks!","I live in Japan for a while as a foreign female. Men are shy here you it‚Äôs fairly common to make the move. 
But maybe if you are only travelling the guy is not going to consider it anything serious. 
His he also 22? A lot of males that age have little dating experience and are just really shy"
dating,1441c8q,2023-06-08 06:24:30,Got my period during sex and he ghosted me. How do I recover?,"I usually can spot the f boys when I see them but I didn‚Äôt with this one and it really stings.

We had a great connection, conversation flowed, etc. I stayed the night and wanted to sleep with him since I knew he was about to be out of town for a while butttt i was also expecting my period. I told him and he was reluctant at first but ended up wanting to do it. Without being too graphic, I was on top and it was good at first but then I got my ahem, period, and it was kind of a lot. He said we should probably stop and I agreed and then apologized. He seemed nice about it and said there was no reason for me to apologize because it‚Äôs natural, etc. 

The next day, I felt a shift in his communication & thought maybe he was genuinely busy but from then on, ours texts went from all day to maybe 1-2 a day. I mentioned how embarrassed I was about what happened and he reassured but then dwindled off a few days later til he completely ghosted. 

Before this happened, we were with his friends and he was acting a little distant towards me around them so things did feel a little off then, so idk if something else happened before then.

Tl;dr: I‚Äôm just utterly humiliated about the whole situation and am embarrassed. I feel like he probably told his friends about it and they probably laughed about it. But I‚Äôm more upset with myself for sleeping with him bc I wouldn‚Äôt have done it unless I saw it going somewhere. It hurts that he just ghosted after 4 dates with no explanation and after we slept together and after we had made future plans. How do I recover from this?","Period or no period it sounds like he would have behaved this way all along.

Don't ever be ashamed of your bodily functions. I've had my period twice during early dates without my knowing I was due. One guy totally cool about it the other acted like I was an alien.

Sure it stings but sounds like he was going to do this to you anyway after sleeping together and just a shame it happened during a vulnerable part of the month. 

There is no way to weed them out. Just know you dodged someone not good for you and there is no shame on your part. Give yourself some self compassion here you put yourself out there not knowing what to expect. It's natural. Give it a little time and jump back in the saddle."
dating,1441c6b,2023-06-08 06:24:22,Occupation Flag,"I‚Äôm an American who met a great Bosnian gal. We both live in central Europe. We met on Bumble and have gone on two dates. We had a third date set up for today but she is now getting more distant after I told her what I do for a living. 

She works for the UN. I build tanks, and NATO is one of our clients. This was a big red flag for her. When I confronted her about this, she reminded me that she is Bosnian, and NATO bombed her country. 

Maybe I am wrong, but the Bosnian war was between the Bosniaks and the Serbs. And the Serbs were the real issue here, also the Croatians who I think were finding for the Serbs. NATO stepped in later after Pakistan crossed a weapons ban (to help the Bosniaks), and was fighting for Bosnia against the Serbs. The war ended not long after NATO stepped in. 

Am I wrong? I am foggy on the Bosnian war, but I don‚Äôt see her issue here.","This is an interesting thread. My partner is in a different occupation than I am, so I know how difficult it can be to manage a relationship while trying to balance our professional lives and interests.

I am sure I did not do anything bad but may have said something that turned her off. I don't know. All I know is when I asked her why she didn't want to see each other anymore, she said it was personalities and connection.

Is it my fault that there was no connection ? Why did it even last for 3 months ? Should it not have already ended in the 1st date ?",Don't blame yourself. Sometimes it's just chemistry thats missing. Just keep on meeting people. I would be only concerned if you start noticing a pattern over a long period of time. Then it might be worth reassesing whether there's something you do wrong.
dating,1440pbu,2023-06-08 05:48:26,How should I (24F) have this conversation with him(31M) after our drunken night I don‚Äôt remember all of?,"This guy comes into my work regularly. For the year I‚Äôve been here. We talk more and more each time. He used to sit alone until one day there was only one free seat and it was at the bar. Now we talk for hours when he comes in. I love talking to him. He‚Äôs kind, funny, smart and laughs at all of my jokes. 

He has invited me to go meet him before at a bar but I have never went. So we just talk every week at my work. More recently we‚Äôve sat down and talked with each other while I was off work a few times and talked for a few hours. 

Last week, we talked for hours, I got a little tipsy and suggested we go to another bar. He said yes and I was a little shocked because he‚Äôd never stay out too late there.

We had fun, talked a lot, had a really fun walk to the bar. We had a drink or 2 and a shot and I got pretty drunk. I told him about the crush I have on him, then BLANK. I don‚Äôt remember what his response is. I remember him walking me home and us hugging. We were out until 4am. 

I haven‚Äôt been able to stop thinking about it. Should I even talk about this with him when I see him again? Should I apologize? I want to know what he said but scared if the answer might be a rejection.

Edit: I hope I didn‚Äôt try and make any passes or try to do something with him while I was drunk(the parts I don‚Äôt remember). what if I was sloppy?",I suggest being as honest and direct as possible when having the conversation. It might not be comfortable but it will feel better in the long run if you can be straightforward and communicate clearly. You know the situation so you know best but try to think about it from the other person's perspective too and give them the respect they deserve. Best of luck.

I took a year off dating after my engagement fell through to process my feelings and heal. My past relationship was healthy. He just needed more time for himself. We are still friends.

Anyway, this new guy I met on Mutual seemed promising, handsome,  charming and all the red flags you can think off in the first week of talking stage. The first night we met 10 minutes into knowing each other he trauma dumped his whole life. Why? I don‚Äôt know. I swear I was never seeing him again after because what he confessed was something I never wanted to involve myself with. However, he kept trying to communicate and was kind and pretended to be everything I was looking for ofcourse. I was like what the hell let‚Äôs see, what‚Äôs the worst that can happen? I gave it a chance. I couldn‚Äôt find friends in mutual but eventually found someone we both knew (his ex wife) already sounds messy but I promise it was a coincidence. Our dates went well. He was going too fast, fake futuring, hypersexual, clingy and gave signs of jealous type. Suddenly, after reaching his objective ( u know) he stopped being clingy. He realized we ‚Äúwent too fast and was scared‚Äù lol. Yup the typical avoidant, unavailable man. I immediately felt sick to my stomach because I knew  this was over. He would randomly call me and disappear stating he was busy bla bla. I couldn‚Äôt believe that this was actually happening but as a result of my poor judgment and weakness I deserved it. I knew better. I wasn‚Äôt strong enough to re-state my boundaries and accepted him breaking through the walls.  I automatically knew that if he cared or actually meant anything he would have protected me. However, I could have protect us too and didn‚Äôt. I failed as well. I didn‚Äôt think much of it because adult dating life is like that. It was just hard because I don‚Äôt sleep around. I don‚Äôt have an anxious attachment style but I could tell he did and had very toxic forms of building relationships. I felt it was rubbing off on me. He admitted to have had an extremely toxic past. He always had an excuse for failing me. He was divorced and had a child so I assumed this may had been a contributing factor. He was very mysterious. I started getting a feeling he had a commitment and just used me for sex and fulfilling his fantasies. I began getting rid of every illusion without further confrontation. I accepted my L and felt like I dogged a bullet. Part of me was hoping he would just block me but he didn‚Äôt. I did let him know a couple times before I left him, how he was hurting my feelings and making me feel confused. I expressed that what he was doing to me was not okay. However, he had excuses to justify it. I feel he knew what he was doing and did the typical text here and there to keep me reeled. I felt insane, insecure, not ok and prayed about it and felt it wasn‚Äôt right and he had so much going on. I had to run away because I felt I had been put through some trauma and just the things we did with each other were not ok or normal. To him it was probably another sexual encounter with a girl from a dating app but I believed everything. I needed to cut the root and deleted him. I was scared of him because I feel he just saw me as a piece of meat without clothes and I don‚Äôt feel ok spiritually or morally. Him having access to my photos made me uncomfortable. Here is the bigger red flag‚Ä¶  The last FaceTime I had with him he had someone else on a video/voice call. It was a males voice telling him, ‚ÄúYOUR MIC IS OFF‚Äù. I was very confused, and did not know why he would even have another phone call going or listening to us talk‚Ä¶I continued about my night and tried giving him the benefit of the doubt and not accuse him of anything. I did not hear much from him after because I ghosted him due to all this weird mysterious crap. I even staged a whole fake relationship to make him think I moved on weeks later. A couple days after a black truck pulls up behind me in a hotel I was staying at. To my surprise I was going live for tik tok and the man who approached me walked away. I recorded his face on my live video. I don‚Äôt think it had a connection but the call was very sketchy. I shared this story to ask you guys what you think. Could he have had plans of hurting me more? The guy was just so weird and unavailable. I liked him so much and I still wish him the best but I am not the one haha. After this ordeal, I felt I needed to cut the tie and run away for my life. I‚Äôm grateful that my friend played my boyfriend. I was becoming more toxic than I already was haha.

What we had in common was that we come from the same culture and the way we were raised was fairly similar. We also speak the same language.
Our date went fine. We spent a few hours together, got coffee. We talked a whole lot and I genuinely enjoyed our time together.

We kept texting back and forth for about a week. Things seem to be going good until she decided to abruptly stop texting me at all. I haven‚Äôt heard from her in days now. 

I‚Äôm not really sure what went wrong or why she stopped talking to me.

Talk with him, let him know your needs with communication and ask him if he can meet you at the same place. If he can't, ask him if you two can compromise.

We said goodnight, which was a little awkward. He apologized for staying late but I told him I was glad he did. I thanked him for coming to church with me and said he was welcome anytime. There was a loose hug and weird tension.  I was SO tired that night so I feel like that contributed to the awkwardness. He said ‚Äúok cool well I‚Äôll text you later this week‚Äù and left. It‚Äôs almost Thursday and I haven‚Äôt heard from him.

I feel like when guys don‚Äôt reach out right away after the first date, it means they just aren‚Äôt interested. Which is fine! I am just wondering if I‚Äôm overthinking this or if there‚Äôs legitimacy to my thoughts on the matter haha.","He might have noticed the awkwardness and doesn‚Äôt want to push it. 

Have you reached out at all? 

You could always send a text saying you hope he is having a good and mention something from the date or movie to let him know you were thinking about it in a positive light."

I'm an introvert so trying to get someone in real life would be difficult especially since I'm not always out & about & dont wanna talk to anyone when I amü§£ 

I never done online dating before & only been one 3 date & that was with my ex. I feel like it would be exciting since I never done it before & wanna feel I guess young & free agian.

Any suggestions & tips would be nice","Since you're a woman looking for a one night stand, anytime. Just say very clearly on your bio you're only looking for exactly that and you'll likely get a guy within minutes, unless you're a catfish.

That said, there's no guarantee your one night stand will know how to make you orgasm. Most likely, you'll find a low quality partner who will only care for his own pleasure."

dating,143xva3,2023-06-08 03:23:11,A woman is demanding that I tell her my height before we meet. Red flag?,"As a taller than average guy (6 ft 2) I've been lucky enough in my life to avoid the problems that arise by being a short guy. I've seen my shorter friends be brutally rejected by women for just being a few inches shy of 6ft tall.

With that being said, I suppose I've developed empathy for my friends over the years. And I don't like being treated like a meter stick. So I remember a while ago I removed my height from my dating profile.

Anyways, I've been talking to this girl for a few days now and we finally decided on a place to meet up. But now, a day before actually meeting up, she wants to know what my height is because ""she needs someone who's at least 5 ft 10 so she can wear heels).

Obviously I meet her requirement, but I'm feeling a little iffy about this situation now. This demand in particular makes me feel dehumanizing in some way. Like , would she really not gonna meet up just because I could potentially be under 5 ft 10? Like Damn, I would never force a girl to tell me her weight or bra size before meeting up. Seems sketch.

What do yall think? Should i just move on?","IMHO as a short guy it's her preference.  When did we start forcing people to date people that they are not attracted to. If I ever come across a woman that prefers taller men I won't have a problem.  I also have my own preferences and refuse to find a partner without certain qualities, or physical attributes, so I understand woman that won't date me for the same reasons."

I‚Äôm reading here people lie.. is it attractive when a woman confidentially tells you she didn‚Äôt cum and that she would tell you if she did? 

3. When he texts me I let him lead the convo.. sometimes I want to be funny and joke but think I can do that in person. It‚Äôs been working so far, but today I wanted the convo to continue because he stopped it and I asked how did your day go? He continued the convo again with good engagement but then stopped it again.. is it good to sometimes do this?

4. We didn‚Äôt sleep with eachother.. he‚Äôs very busy with work so it‚Äôs hard during the week to see each other and I work a lot too. Is that the reason he‚Äôs still around? Cause he wants that?

However, my girlfriend of 2 weeks just admitted that she is not the physically affectionate type. She told me that she is the kind of person who would listen to a (lady) friend in distress rant, and then proceed to give them a pep talk to the effect of ""here's how you can get over what you're going through"" instead of offering a hug. She admits that she has tried to improve on this over time but with little progress (after her friends mentioned it)..  
I consider myself the romantic type who believes in old fashioned romance - letters, cuddles, sweet nothings, surprises, hugs and the like. I have always longed for a very affectionate woman - it is a GREEN flag for me. I know that this is early days (2 weeks) however, somehow I think she may never improve/change since I have my eyes on something terms with her.  
Any advice on how to handle this would be greatly appreciated..","If it's important enough and something you need, you'll need to remember that it's a priority for you and might need to consider moving in if necessary. If your desired green flags aren't present, then it's a red flag. It doesn't necessarily mean that the relationship is doomed, nor that she doesn't care, but it could make it more difficult for you to maintain interest in the relationship longer term. 

To be perfectly honest, this is what the early phases of relationships are for: figuring out if you are compatible and whether or not you want to mutually stick around. It takes practice and getting used to, but basically don't be afraid to walk away at any point for any reason, because in the end it's better to be single overall than it is to settle for less than what you want or need."

dating,es2cek,2020-01-21 22:35:34,r/Dating is NOT the place to soapbox Incel/Blackpill rhetoric.,"There has been a slow and steady influx of unwanted and misguided conversation plaguing our boards over the last year or so. I don't think this is a surprise to any of you all. While we ultimately encourage healthy discussion around both the positives and negatives of dating the overall spirit of this sub has been lost. Many of our readers have expressed their concern to our moderation team and we honestly feel the same way.

Our ""No Soap-boxing or Promoting an Agenda"" rule has always been on the sidebar for our users to see but I want to stress our current stance on the topic. **Soap-boxing will and has always included red/black-pill ideology, ""alpha-male"" talk, and the subset of vocabulary that comes with it.** 

This means that using our board to preach about how there is no hope for men (or women) who are conventionally unattractive is unwanted and will be removed. Using our board to discuss how you think women are shallow and will only choose the top percentage of men is unwanted and will be removed. Even just a mention of the term ""Chad"" is unwanted and will be removed.

We can sympathize that dating is difficult and is even more difficult for people that might not be the prettiest. It's no secret to anyone. What we value though is genuine discussion and helping those who actually want and need it. The countless misogynistic threads about how women and society aren't fair to men are toxic and don't do anyone any favors. There are better subreddits that would love to discuss these types of concerns with you in a more healthy way. Misandry is as equally intolerable. 

At the end of the day let's lift each other up. Let's share our experiences and learn and/or laugh from them! Ask the questions that need to be asked. But let's not lose sight of what dating is really about.

**EDIT: If you do see any rule breaking behavior please report so that we can take action. It's hard to see every comment. Thanks!**","Reminder: please review our rules, especially rule 4:

- No broad generalizations, e.g. ""All women are x and do y""

dating,147yt9e,2023-06-12 21:55:45,Did he (24) get distant because I (22) refused sex?,"This happened a long time ago, but I need somebody to make sense of this situation to me. 

I met the guy on a dating app, he reached out to me, was quite flirty, and initiated a date at his place. I asked to meet in a public place instead, and he suggested a bar which was close to where he lives. We met, it went well, we had really a lot in common so I liked him. After the date he walked me to his place, even though I had told him earlier that I didn‚Äôt want to go to his place. I made an excuse and left, but the following day he asked me for my IG and said he was deleting tinder. 

A month goes by (we were both away as it was Christmas break), he doesn‚Äôt message me at all after the date but watches my stories and likes some of them. Eventually we‚Äôre both back in town but he doesn‚Äôt initiate a meeting, so I do it. He postpones it a few times because he‚Äôs busy, but ultimately we plan something and he suggests getting some food and going to my place. I reluctantly agree, since I know what that implies. Date goes great, he‚Äôs very respectful, we have a lot in common, he seems like he likes me, we talk about my past, his past, him wanting kids in the future etc. Then we go to my place, he suggests watching a movie in bed which we do. He attempts to initiate sex a few times, which I refused (I didn‚Äôt feel ready). He takes it well, is kind, but leaves earlier in the morning than he said he would and looks visibly disappointed. 

After that, a week goes by and I don‚Äôt hear anything from him. No plans of another date, nothing. He continues watching my stories but doesn‚Äôt heart them. Eventually I reach out (again) and say that I felt like our last date ended quite awkwardly and ask if he‚Äôs down to meet again. He says he is, but when I ask him when he‚Äôs free, he says he‚Äôll let me know. I knew he told me earlier that he was busy with work and college, but several days pass by and he still doesn‚Äôt let me know about his availability and stops watching my IG stories. I reach out yet again (unfortunately) and say I‚Äôm free the following weekend if he wants to come (at this point I had already caught feelings for him and felt quite desperate), he suggests I come to his place. We set a date (that would be 3 WEEKS since our second date) and I ask him to send me his address then later, he just hearts the message.

Would you guys say, at this point that he was only looking for something casual/a hook up, especially judging by how distant and reluctant he got after our second date? I found that really confusing because it felt like we were so similar and had so much in common, and that he genuinely liked me. Also, I don‚Äôt have much dating experience so it‚Äôs hard for me to tell.",

dating,rznqgx,2022-01-09 09:12:56,I had the worst date of my entire life,"I(29f) met this guy(32m) on hinge & we was talking for about a week. He lived an hour away from me so we were trying to plan our first date. We spent a lot of time talking on the phone, had some FaceTime dates & I was really feeling him. He was handsome & fit with a good job and no kids, that was rare enough as is. 

Eventually he asks me to go to this botanical garden to look at Christmas lights at night, which was another hour from me but two hours away from him. When he showed up to pick me up. He had two babies in the car. He tells me he lied to me & that he is a father. I got so mad. But I felt obligated to proceed with the date since he had just driven an hour out to see me with these kids.

So we go the whole extra hour out, I‚Äôm still mad so I‚Äôm not talking much. The babies are f(6) & m(4). We get there & when everyone got out of the car I noticed his daughter wasn‚Äôt dressed at all for this occasion. It was cold that night & he had her in a t-shirt & biker shorts with mismatched socks on & mismatched ballerina slippers & her curly mixed-girl hair was not done at all it looked like she rolled out of bed & he just brought her out there. I was like wtf. I felt embarrassed because I know ppl would look at us thinking I‚Äôm her mother & wonder how tf I have her out here looking a hot mess like that, while I‚Äôm looking cute, rocking Gucci but this child doesn‚Äôt even have a jacket. 

So we go into the garden and his kids start throwing the biggest tantrums over normal basic child care. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre hungry dad we haven‚Äôt eaten in hours‚Äù ‚Äúwe‚Äôre thirsty‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm cold‚Äù I was like wtf. He didn‚Äôt have any supplies for them for this two hour road trip he brought them on.

And the whole time they‚Äôre suffering he wants to be all up on me & ignoring them. I also noticed when he was close to me he reeked of tequila. Now they‚Äôre yelling ‚ÄúI hate u dad‚Äù & telling me they don‚Äôt like me. I‚Äôm sitting there like look I‚Äôm with y‚Äôall I‚Äôm starting to hate y‚Äôall daddy too. That place had no food for them, nowhere to buy drinks, no little store to buy them jackets. I was like look I‚Äôm ready to go.

So we‚Äôre leaving it‚Äôs late like 10pm. We drive off and pass all this city driving for like 20 mins, didn‚Äôt stop once to feed these kids. oh and he can‚Äôt drive he‚Äôs swerving all over the road most likely drunk & he runs out of gas. On a bridge.

I just couldn‚Äôt believe it I thought running out of gas was something u did  when you‚Äôre between 16-19 years old. We sat there, kids whining, him throwing an anger fit at himself me texting my sister to come get me‚Ä¶we sat there for 45 mins and eventually a nice person stopped and gave him some gas. 

We drive to the nearest gas station the kids are asleep I run into the gas station because I also hungry and buy me some snacks while I think he‚Äôs filling up the car. The line was long and I was probably in the store for 10 minutes. When I came out he was standing by the pump & got mad when he saw me I said what‚Äôs wrong and he began walking into the store & said ‚ÄúI need to pay for gas‚Äù so I was like wtf did he expect me to fill his tank? 

He pays gets gas we go on our way he‚Äôs swerving like crazy now. We get to my house at like midnight & he‚Äôs saying his phone is dead. I didn‚Äôt give a fuck but I felt bad for them kids so I said okay y‚Äôall can come in to use a charger. This man came inside & fell straight to sleep on the couch. I had to put his kids back to sleep in my guest room. I went into my room & stayed up just because I didn‚Äôt want him in my house. 

Once 6am hit I woke his ass up and told him to go. Those poor kids were still trying to eat they were asking me if I had cereal. I gave them some granola bars and said bye.

dating,i44vev,2020-08-05 12:58:37,"Let's stop telling people ""looks don't matter"", because they absolutely do, to the vast majority of people","People who genuinely have a ""Looks don't matter"" mentality towards other people they would date are very rare. For the vast majority of people, men and women, looks DO matter and they play a considerable role in attraction alongside other things.

No it's not the *only* thing that matters, but it IS **a** thing that matters.

So whenever someone suggests that they may be unattractive and that could play a role in their lack of (fe)male attention, don't just doubt them because it could very well be a factor. Alongside other things.

The majority of couples have matched looks, sometimes with one considerably more attractive than the other (usually the woman more attractive). But if the majority of couples have matched looks, it should be an indicator that ""leagues"" are somewhat real.

Either way, ""looks don't matter"" is like saying ""personality doesn't matter"". They both matter a lot. Unless you are in the small small minority, you are likely lying when you are saying that someone's looks doesn't play a role in your romantic attraction to them.

Both men and women have been rejected because the rejectee decided they weren't physically attractive enough, whether it be facial features, height, weight, clothes, etc. To pretend this doesn't happen (even often or frequently) is wishful thinking!","Yeah, looks definitely matter to most people. Some people have different standards than others, but even to those people looks still matter, 
it's just a different spectrum. It's easy to sit there and say looks don't matter when it's not your own problem, as that's generally how it happens. You notice how it's never the people that can't get dates that say that looks don't matter? It's always coming from someone that doesn't have trouble with dating. 

That's not to say that personality isn't super important. It absolutely is. Looks can get you in the door but personality keeps you there. The problem is, you can have the best personality on the planet but without the looks to get you in the door you're still stuck outside."

I was a little bit puzzled (we‚Äôve had sex before).  She then informs me she has her period, appears visibly upset and apologizes.  I sort of start laughing; now she looks puzzled.

I tell her I‚Äôm chuckling at the apology; there is absolutely no reason to be sorry and I couldn‚Äôt be happier just giving her a kiss at midnight and waking up beside her tomorrow (she‚Äôs never spent the night).  I offer her a heating pad, pillows and to run out to grab some midol; whatever she needs to be comfortable, she need only let me know.

The result was a lovely young lady, stunned by the thoughtfulness and filled with appreciation.  Though I invited a ‚Äòdate‚Äô over for dinner, we brought up exclusivity and I woke up beside my new ‚Äògirlfriend‚Äô the next morning.

dating,cs5jz8,2019-08-18 19:09:37,How to be an attractive guy.,"All of this advice on ""how to read women"" and ""what to do/say"" is bs. Social ""intelligence"" and body language are two very idiotic concepts because those rarely come innate and are very hard to control. This is why us guys stress ""say what you want"" because social ""cues"" are purposely misleading and cause misunderstandings more than not. And yet most women *still* rely on them more than verbal cues. 

It took me 10 years to ""learn"" social norms and cues, and how to portray confidence. I've read every ""pick up"" and ""how to date/be attractive to women"" book and article there is. From ones written by Red Pill misogynists to ones written by hardcore feminists/misandrists. I've spent hours and hours reading and practicing. I've bought lesson after lesson.

**It's all a waste of time.** 

If you're putting that much effort into being attractive, *no one* will find you attractive. 

The best thing I learned after all this time is to sit down and really figure out if I like myself. If you do this and you don't like yourself, figure out what you don't like and change it. *Self-Love is the most important love you can have.* Self-love comes before *everyone else* besides your children. You cannot love someone else, til you love yourself. 

Once you love who you are, spend every day focused on what *you* want. Ignore every woman unless she's a part of your life. Think of it like this: as a straight man, when other random men pass by, how do you view them? You don't. You don't care. They could be invisible. 

Yet when a random cute girl passes by she immediately occupies all the space in your brain. 

And she's literally done nothing but have a good bone structure and probably some meat on her body. Big whoop.

As a man you are *going* to learn this someday in life: The most gorgeous super model in the world still takes shits everyday just like you. Stop putting them on a pedestal and hiding your emotions. If you're on a date and there's a silence and she seems bored, ask yourself are you bored? Is she entertaining you? Is she making you laugh? No? Then why are you so concerned about entertaining her? No matter what our media portrays, it is not your job to entertain women. 

Focus on yourself and making sure you're having a good time. Focus on your life and make sure *you're* having fun. I'm not saying be a complete asshole. You should always care about people, but **not** more than you care about yourself. I've gotten so much attention from women by focusing on myself versus when I used to try and focus on them. 

So that's my advice.",Man this is so real. At age 32 and having basically zero relationships and recently a girl saying she doesn't want to talk to me anymore because she feels nothing towards. I needed to hear/read this. Thank you

dating,f44ijz,2020-02-15 04:34:07,RANT: Dating as a woman is NOT easier. Finding love as a woman is NOT easier. Finding sex is. It's not the same. We are just as lonely.,"I'm part of the foreveralone subreddit because I haven't had a serious relationship in 5 years. Yet, none of the posts there describe me, and if I were to ever post anything, they'd chew me up so fast: I'm a woman, objectively physically attractive, it's very easy for me to get ""dates."" As a result, I'm not ""forever alone"" because people want to go on dates with me, right? Right?

Sure, let's agree that women, in particular, steoreotypically attractive women (young, fit), can get dates. Sure. Ok.

But number of matches in tinder does not equal love. Guys buying you drinks does not equal love. Guys sleeping with you and then GHOSTING you does not equal love. Guys leading you on and breadcrumbing you for WEEKS or even MONTHS  is not love.

And little tiny scraps of attention here and there, or even sexual interest, does not, in any way, somehow quench our loneliness.

We are still lonely. I'm still lonely.

Yes women can be lonely. Pretty women can be lonely. Women can be surrounded by the ""attention"" of 20 men and STILL be lonely. Hint: because more often than not, it's not real attention. It's fleeting, momentary, empty, and baseless. It will be gone. Very soon. Maybe by the night's end.

I'm just so exhausted of my feelings of loneliness being dismissed over and over. As if I didn't have a right to feel lonely or sad. Here's a list of all the guys I've ""dated"" over the past 5 years:

\- Guy that was gonna move to Asia in 3 months. Said he loved me deeply while simultaneously keeping a girl in Asia ""warm"" for when he got there. When I complained he explained that he was being logical, as he was gonna move there soon, he needed to keep his options open.

\- Guy who wooed me and made me laugh for weeks and then months only for me to discover he had a LIVE IN GIRLFRIEND back in his home country all along. Texts me that he misses me to this day.

\- Guy that i was crazy about that would generously grace me with his presence for 1 HOUR A WEEK for MONTHS. When I spoke up about it he said that was all he could do. Take it or leave. I took it. Even though I cried for the other 6 days every week.

\- Guy that slept with me for 1 entire year, gave me an orgasm ONE TIME in that year, and when I spoke to him about it, said it was my fault. After a weekend full of sex in which he came 6 times and I came 0 and I begged him to please try he accused me of rape. Said I was forcing him. I stopped talking to him. A month later he showed up at my house again, said he treated me so harsh because deep down he thought I was a ""bad person"" but that he (and i quote his exact words) ""still want to fuck"" me.

Those are the long term guys. In-between, I've had several other short-term ones, including the guy I went on 2 horrible dates with, was thoroughly confused when he kept on asking me out (we had no chemistry) and then ended up literally BLOCKING ME as soon as he slept with me and then disappeared. Or the guy who showered me with promises of fun date after fun date after fun date, only to completely disappear in a couple weeks too. But not block me or ghost me no- just string me along whenever I ask, make sure I'm kept warm in the repertoire.

I'm tired of being used as a sexual commodity, I'm tired of having my feelings played with. I want love. Real love. I'm so ready and willing to commit to one man only, to build a family, to build a life. I'm ready to give a man my all. But somehow because I can ""get dates"" easily is like Im not entitled to feeling lonely, to feeling unwanted. But how can I not feel unwanted when the last time I heard the words ""i love you"" were 5 years ago?

/rant ends here

EDIT 1: WOW THIS BLEW UP!!! Thanks for the Silver and 2 Awards!! Thank you so much for the kind comments, messages, and even chats I've received. My inbox is very full right now, I'm trying to get back to everyone. A few thoughts:

1. I was both glad/sad to read SOOO many women's comments with the \*exact same\* experience as me. Glad that we were able to find each other and provide support, yet sad that so many of us exist and are stuck in this conundrum.
2. I was also very pleasantly surprised and touched by how many men reached out in kindness and understanding! Even though men have a different experience when it comes to dating and romance, most men were able to put themselves in women's shoes for a moment and understand, even if for just a little bit, what our experience is like here on the other side, and how we can be just as lonely.
3. There were also very, very few (maybe 5 compared to the 2,300 that upvoted?) people that reached out, all men, with actual harassment and threats of physical violence. To those people I will not respond, but I actually wish them love and kindness. I've clearly had bad experiences in dating but yet, I don't hate men. Not one bit. It's the opposite: I am actively looking for 1 man I can give my heart and soul to, and try to find this man, over and over again. Yet, these \~5 or so men that contacted me with violence, do hate women. To them, I wish their souls are healed. You can never find love with so much hate in your heart.
4. Finally, to all men and women, gay, straight, bi, pan, or any other sexual orientation, that commented with similar feelings of loneliness and a deep desire to find love: I wish all of us good fortune. I hope we all find what we are looking for.","For us guys it's hard to understand this because it's a completely different experience than what we go through. *However* the reason why I think this post should be stickied on this subreddit forever is because you explained perfectly how even though it's different for women, *it's not better*. 

You've got to understand that for guys who haven't had sex or even the prospect of it for a year plus, hearing about you having sex with this guy for 6 months and then this guy, and then another guy is envy-inducing because having that many partners is something they probably don't even dream of happening anymore.

But that's why it's different. For you it probably feels like you're picking through an endless field of bad crops trying to find a good one. You've picked up so many bad crops that at this point you're likely exhausted and just done with trying to find a good crop in this mess. All you see and endure for miles and miles is *endless* bad crops.

For guys it's like being in a barren field, working it constantly to get anything to grow, begging for rain, and still nothing ever comes (pun intended). They hear about your endless field and think *what I would give to have that many crops*, but as you've explained really well: what's the point of having endless bad crops? 

For me, I'm somewhat attractive and I get a little attention from women, but I know as soon as I engage I'm expected to put on the show. To be funny and charming and engaging and mysterious. 

And I'm at an age where I know who I am and I have no interest in faking a persona just to keep a woman's attention. I just can't do it. I've ran into time and time again where a girl will flirt or give me attention and then it'll die as soon as I don't do the above things, so I just ignore it now. So I get a little (small fraction) of what you're saying even as a guy, because all attention is not good attention. In fact most of the time it's bad attention for one reason or another.

----------------------------------------

EDIT: I suggest everyone check out Aziz Ansari's book *Modern Romance*. He gathered a bunch of psychologist and did the largest study of modern dating ever done up to that point. He traveled several countries and spoke to hundreds, if not near thousands of people. I got the audiobook and it was well worth the price. I would suggest any guy reading it definitely *shouldn't* emulate the ""lonely dude just looking for love"" persona he has because it is the most unattractive look on a guy, but besides that, it *really* opened my eyes to the problems that modern dating is dealing with, like no other generation before."
dating,uxqfun,2022-05-25 20:34:21,Completely checked out and traumatized from dating after my date died the second time we hung out together. NSFW,"TW: Death 


We met on Tinder and kicked things off pretty quickly. She was enthusiastic about meeting me and taking me out on my birthday for our first date. It went really well but I felt like something was strangely off about her that night. The next couple of weeks we had been texting/calling each other everyday. She expressed to me how stressed out with school she was, her depression, and other trauma related issues. I felt overwhelmed and at a loss wishing I could do more for her situation. I kept telling her that she could always come over and get away if needed. 

When she finally found the time to do so, she came over and I made her dinner. We cuddled, watched Lords of Chaos (great movie btw), and had sex. It was a very wholesome and comforting night for both of us. We both fell asleep holding each other and joking around together. I got the best sleep ever having someone with me that I cared about. We woke up a few times to get water and kept falling back asleep.

Until, I was woken up with her rapidly breathing. I thought that she was having a night terror or bad dream. I held her hand as it cramped up. Her neck tilt back and I held it away from the pillows so she wouldn't suffocate. I got very concerned at this point that something was very fucking wrong. She took these three giant agonal breathes and suddenly stopped. I shook her a few times to wake up and that's when I realized what happened. I put my head to her chest and heard nothing. It was the scariest fucking sound I've ever heard. 

I immediately called 911 and had to lift her off the bed onto the floor in order to do chest compressions until the EMS showed up. I was doing my fucking damdest to keep my head straight because it was spinning from the anxiety I was having. The EMS stormed in and took over. They were constantly questioning me her medical history or family info and I was helpless because I barely knew her or family. They spent an hour on her on my living room floor trying to get a pulse. I stumbled outside and took the social media trying to find family members. I sent out multiple messages about the emergency but never got a response.

Once they got a pulse she was rushed to the hospital. I followed along but stopped by her apartment on the way to let them know what happened and to get in touch with emergency contacts. I finally got a hold of her Mother and told her where I was and what happened. 

Stuck in the ER alone they wouldn't give me any information until her family showed up. I was a fucking wreck by this point. Her Mother and Sister shows up and I explain more of the situation. They both get invited into the family room and I decline to go in. I get taken out by a social worker an hour later and was told ""she didn't make it"". I knew what was coming and I kept my. expectations low but the pain of hearing those words were still devastating.

Her family came out an hour later and sat with me. I told them the complete story and expressed my condolences. It happened all so fast and felt like a literal movie. They were very supportive, loving, and thankful that I was there to take care of her and that she didn't die alone. 

I spent the rest of the day with friends processing what just happened. Drank into a blackout and couldn't return back to my apartment due to the trauma. Woke up on my friends couch and time just felt slow for the next three days. 

I knew you for a short time Emily, but every moment was special. I will never forget you and your infectious laugh. Rest in peace. 

As for her death, I want to be as respectful about what she was going through beforehand. But it led to her having a heart attack that morning.

I don't really know where to go from here. Dating in Austin, TX is already a goddamn dumpster fire. The loneliness at times has been really hard and other times content. This is all still fresh to me since it happened 6 weeks ago. Couldn't be more thankful for her Mother and Sister who have been very supportive. 

Thank you for taking the time to read my story.","Omg... Therapy bro.

Even if you think she's crazy.

She's giving you her body, and trusting you. She is human and deserves respect.

Edit: YES this applies going from girls to guys as well.

Edit: One would really think this is a no brainer but the amount of pushback in the comments is unsurprising and kind of depressing.

Edit: To those who are saying ""if she's willing to give sex and open her legs she doesn't respect herself and doesn't deserve it, well if YOU are willing to sleep with her or someone that doesn't show self respect, that means that YOU don't actually respect yourself all that much."" Also just because someone wants sex that doesn't mean they don't respect themselves, they are just looking for a good time just like YOU are. That means giving them an orgasm if they gave you one, making them feel safe, and respecting boundaries. Also keeping whatever is private in the bedroom and not declaring it to your friends (if it wasn't agreed upon).

Edit: What do I mean by respect? I don't mean treating her like your gf, but I do mean just treating her like a human and not saying shit like ""if she opened up her legs that means she doesn't deserve respect."" Also respecting her sexual boundaries in bed even though she's not your gf. No pouting and no expecting X,Y,Z to happen JUST because she's in your bed.

Edit: And, lastly, if you feel you can't handle doing all this then maybe you need to lower the amount of people you are hooking up with so they can all be treated with respect.",The people that need to be told this don‚Äôt listen anyway.

I went through an extremely crushing heartbreak recently because my ‚Äúgirlfriend‚Äù was still holding a torch for a guy she had dated at a little before we met.

We had a great relationship for 4 months. I was the happiest I‚Äôve been in a while. This last year has been difficult in my life and when I started seeing her it was a break from the rest of the life. From the global pandemic, from a soul sucking college semester, from family issues. She was my reprieve and it made me forget the bad when I was with her.

Then, a week after my 21st birthday she dumped me out of nowhere. She told me that she wasn‚Äôt ready for a relationship. I was hurt but I was okay with it. Our time together was genuine. Then 2 weeks later I saw her posting about her first month with her boyfriend. 

I called her out on it and she said that she was sorry but she was still in love with him and just didn‚Äôt want to hurt me. And that‚Äôs when it crushed me. Our relationship was fake, I was a distraction for her and when the guy she actually wanted came around I was worthless.

Backstory: Im a 27 year old guy just FYI. About a month ago on the dot, my sister and her girlfriends were inquiring about why I'm not ""talking to any girls"". I told them the truth - ""I've never had any girl say yes when I've asked them out, nor has any girl ever shown me any interest.""

My sister suggested ""Why not just use Tinder? That will be easy to get you someone to talk to!"" 

I was like ""Are you kidding me? I'm literally invisible on dating sites.""

She said something along the lines of ""I'm gonna take some nice photos of you right now and get you a girl ASAP.""

I told her ""I bet you 100 bucks that you can't get me a date within a month. I've been trying for years."".

They all laughed and she accepted the challenge.

She took a bunch of photos for me wearing some nice clothes, made a profile for me with some funny/charismatic content, and here we are 1 month later, still dateless.  

She video chatted with me earlier saying that she couldn't believe how hard it was to get any matches, let alone get any of the girls to reply to me. She was also surprised at the rate at which some of the matches unmatched her once they received a nice message from her. I could tell how frustrated she was with the whole experience of dating as an unattractive dude (although she will never admit that I'm unattractive).

I'm not posting this to get any pity though. I personally think that this was an educating experience for my sister and her friends. I think that her Tinder account has over 1000 likes, so it was like two completely different worlds colliding. I actually think that now she understands my predicament a lot better, and I doubt that she will be hard on me for not having a girlfriend anymore. But only time will tell.

So anyways,  I might not be a ladies man, but I made some easy cash and now at least my sister understands me better üòÇüòÇ",Now find someone else to do the same bet and just start a monopoly. Who needs dates when you can earn free money.

dating,te15o7,2022-03-14 16:16:02,"If someone had told me that downloading Tinder would lead to me drawing a man a bath and checking him for a hernia, I would have laughed.","Weirdest date ever. That's all I can say. Not a first date, but still weird.

He (44m) invited me (31F) to meet him at a coffee shop because we both had work we needed to do. After a few hours we stand up to leave and he mentions that he injured himself earlier in the day.

Wouldn't you know, he can't stand up and he can barely walk. Now, I'm not a petit woman. I'm 5'8""; I work out. I can help. It's not like he's *The Mountain* or anything and he's built like a little jackrabbit. So I help him up and help him to his car, but he is **struggling**.

I offer to make him dinner if he wanted to come over because I had been marinating some chicken anyway. He accepts and we head back to my house. It's worth saying that I have a three floor townhouse with lots of steps. It's also worth saying that I have a tendency to be clumsy and so I have all sorts of ace bandages, crutches, etc in my house.

I set him up on the couch, bring him water, a heating pad, a pillow to hold for sneezing/coughing, crutches to help him stand without using whatever was injured, and start cooking dinner.

Eventually he chimes in with, ""I promise I'm not just trying to show you my dick, but can you look at this?""

Wouldn't you know, there's a weird bump near his groin. So now, what was a pulled muscle might actually be a hernia. I offer to take him somewhere, but he refuses. Instead, he asks me to wrap an compression wrap around the bump.

Eventually I ask him if a warm bath would make him feel better and he says that it might. Trouble is, he can't really go from sitting to standing all too well. So I draw him a bath and sit there. The whole time. I jokingly throw in a colorful, sparkly bath bomb and bring him a glass of wine because of the sheer absurdity of the situation.

I'm sitting here. Bathing a grown man. One I met off Tinder. I felt his groin for a hernia. I compression wrapped said groin.

This man has absolutely tested the limits of my domesticity. And I actually didn't mind. We've been seeing one another since December and I'm kind of in love with him.

Edit/update: he got it checked out. The lump was from the swelling of a torn muscle. Still not good, but not as bad as a hernia.",Gotta get you some goalie gloves cause you‚Äôre definitely a keeper‚Ä¶üëçüèº

I wonder where he is and what he's doing. I wonder if he's in a relationship right now. I wonder if he's happy or if he's miserable. I wonder if he wonders about me too. I think about how much I wish he were here with me and how I can't wait to finally meet him. I think about how all this bullshit will have been worth it if it's what leads me to him.

But sometimes I wonder if he even exists at all, or if he will forever remain a product of my imagination.","This is so wholesome! I think about him all the time too :)

as someone who drinks almost only water, it really annoyed me. it‚Äôs probably just me who‚Äôs unlucky enough to have such bad taste in guys but i wanna know if this is a common thing?? 
is drinking water considered gay, bros???

   i definitely feel less crazy now that i see most people agree it actually is weird they didn‚Äôt drink water, most of the comments here have made my day one way or another so thank you for that.

dating,dgizvi,2019-10-11 18:13:34,A tinder story,"A few years ago, my girlfriend dumped me for another guy. I felt heartbroken. I‚Äôm not a very emotional person but I was crying for a whole day. I didn‚Äôt know what to do. I eventually re downloaded tinder. I got a few compliments and dates but nothing special and I felt like giving up. But then I saw this one girl. There was something different about her. 

She was everything I ever wanted. Smart, cute, athletic, motivated, helpful. She wasn‚Äôt like the ten gals that want to be stay at home moms and eat Cheetos all day long (no offense to any sahm) that I just swiped left on. I swiped right on her and I kept checking my phone for a notification. A few hours later she matched with me and we messaged back and forth for hours. She agreed to go out on a date. 

I was hit with nerves about everything. I freaking wore a red flannel shirt, ripped dark blue jeans, and black leather boots. I got a bottle of wine and spilt it everywhere. I thought it was done but she felt different. She viewed me as genuine. 

After a few more dates (that we‚Äôre also much better), we began dating. We got higher paying jobs and eventually moved in together. She has been my world for the past three years. Even if it‚Äôs just reading and drinking coffee on a rainy day, the view of her makes me feel the sun start shining. Tomorrow she planned a date at the original restaurant where we met for our three year anniversary. 

Tomorrow I will also be proposing. 

I felt lost and alone but I would feel like that all again if it meant I have her in my life. I am super happy to have gotten her father‚Äôs blessing, as it means I get to possibly have her in the rest of my life. Don‚Äôt give up.

So I matched with this guy on a dating app.  He‚Äôs a pizza maker/delivery boy about a 5 minutes walk from my apartment.  Probably have seen him a few times even.  But I thought he was cute in his profile, and moreover goofy, which is 100% my style

We had a plan to meet up later this week for the first time but today after work he texted me saying he just got off work and wanted to see (just my face!!) for a second.

I decided to be spontaneous and go, no makeup and leisure clothes in all.  I came out, and we immediately started going for a walk (masks on).

We ended up walking and talking and joking and holding hands for two hours.  (Don‚Äôt worry korea isn‚Äôt quarantined, my area is small and there was literally no one around) His profile only had one picture, so I wasn‚Äôt sure exactly what he looked like.  By the end of it, i realized I only saw his eyes the entire time.  I mentioned it.  But at the same time, I felt like it really didn‚Äôt matter.

The whole time we didn‚Äôt have to worry about appearances, just talk and have fun

If you say something like that to me, I WILL call you out without question because you don't get to put my race down like that. If you think it's wrong to say ""you're pretty smart for a black guy"" to a black man, then don't say similar shit to Asian guys. We're not pushovers who's gonna take that racist bullshit lying down.

Just a note, I think I wasn't clear about the nature of my relationship with her; we've been distant friends for close to a year, and I actually took her out on a first date 2 weeks ago. This is why I was more upset than I typically should be, as I have had a growing crush on her for a while and the first date was actually quite great. Oh, and sadly I didn't go out and enjoy a solo date like a lot of you guy suggested, because I really wasn't in the mood for it. I'll hopefully be better by tomorrow.*

I took the whole day off. Cancelled all my plans, shaved my beard and cleaned myself up and have been looking forward to this date for the past few days. As I sat there all suited up and ready to leave, I get the text. I'm such a fucking idiot. All this time, I was the only one taking the initiative. I asked her out for the first date and have been initiating text with her for the past couple of weeks. I saw zero effort on her end and yet, like the blind gullible idiot I was, I still put the effort in.

So he was 37, about ten years older than me. 

He was good-looking and financially successful. The whole date, which was two hours, he kept making comments about how he doesn't like going on apps in our Southern city, as girls are not as in-shape and there are some single moms. He also insinuated several times he just doesn't find women his age attractive.

About forty times, he mentioned his salary (which is high.) He kept talking about the car and house he wanted, and the house he bought for himself, etc.

I felt like I was in a cartoon. At one point, he said he had a bunch of books at his old apartment in a European city he got stationed at for his job (in hedge fund management), which he never read, kept there to impress other people, and just gave away when he moved.

There was absolutely nothing inside of him. He did not have any appreciation for beauty or for art, for love, for anything. His whole operation was to find the smartest and most beautiful woman under 30 who would date him, and that was that.

I read a lot of dating complaints here from women, and I want you to know that it is better to be alone than with someone like that. Do not be swayed by good looks and money, if there's nothing inside of the person.","Though I am not a woman, if they mention their salary that‚Äôs an immediate disqualification.

dating,j1pknj,2020-09-29 01:31:08,ALWAYS ALWAYS assume the person you‚Äôre with is seeing other people unless stated otherwise.,"I‚Äôm in shambles right now. 

I (24F) this guy (22M) off a dating app about three months ago. We moved pretty quickly to seeing each other multiple times a week, and on the days we didn‚Äôt  see each other we‚Äôd play online games together from home as well as texting semi-frequently. 

I‚Äôd grown pretty used to having him around and really started to fall for him, he‚Äôd bring me flowers, take me stargazing, call me ‚Äúbaby‚Äù the works. 

Our most recent date he takes me to a nice outdoor restaurant when halfway through dinner i notice it: a hickey the size of a quarter on his neck. 

My headed started whirring as I realized we hadn‚Äôt seen in a few days and knew for fact it couldn‚Äôt have been done by me. He tried to deny it at first but couldn‚Äôt keep up the act. He‚Äôd admitted he went on a few dates with another girl and their makeout sesh had gotten a bit steamy. 

I broke into tears as what felt like a semi truck hit me in the gut. He went in to say that he assumed I was seeing other people too solely due to the fact that I have a place to myself and that we‚Äôd met on an app. I told him I hadn‚Äôt seen anyone else because I didn‚Äôt WANT to, I was so stuck on him I hardly cared for anyone else. And I assumed he‚Äôd feel the same- I‚Äôm surprised he even found the time to see another person while we were wrapped up in what I saw as mutual puppy love. 

We went back to my place and I could tell he felt some remorse about it all. He said he didn‚Äôt realize he was leading me on (??how??) and outlined the several reasons why he thought we wouldn‚Äôt be good as boyfriend and girlfriend, including some not-so-nice statements about my personality that I had no idea he was thinking. 

I‚Äôm also pretty cautious of COVID and I find it disrespectful that he would quickly go from swapping spit with someone else to me. 

Anyways. That‚Äôs the story. Please, please, please. Save yourself the heartbreak. Don‚Äôt do what I did. If you‚Äôre reaching the stage in a relationship where you want to become exclusive, say it. Even if the relationship ends there, it‚Äôll end far less painfully than mine did.

Edit: thank you everyone for your kind comments. It makes me feel so much better to hear your thoughts, stories, and advice. 

To those saying it‚Äôs my fault for not defining the relationship, I see what you mean. I think it‚Äôs on both of us - him for leading me on for as long as he did and me for just assuming what he was thinking.

Thank you all for engaging with discussion here, I think this is an important topic of today‚Äôs dating that isn‚Äôt talked about enough.","I‚Äôm sorry that happened to you but yes, unfortunately in today‚Äôs dating ‚Äúage‚Äù, you need to quite literally state exclusivity or else it usually isn‚Äôt.

Three or four times, he made me feel a bit weird with comments like, ""I love your style, you're not too much. Most girls these days slather an inch of makeup on their faces"" and things like that.

Then he asked if I'd like to go on a date, and I didn't answer - I decided to Google his name first. I could see his full name in his IG handle (he'd offered to add me before). I found his Twitter pretty quick. And ... hoooo boy.

This guy isn't just a keyboard warrior, he's a full-on cyber bully and a creep. He only targets women on Twitter, women he doesn't even know but constantly levels verbal abuse at them under their selfies, commenting on their makeup and undermining their appearances (those women looked pretty gorgeous to me!). The intensity of his vitriol was insane. He'd tell them to hang themselves if they replied disparagingly to him, and his tweets all revolved around ""females"" and ""feminazis"". One tweet aimed at a girl who told him to piss off essentially said, ""Girls like you needed an abusive father.""

I actually reported his account. I don't even know how it's still active, with that kind of abuse. But that was definitely the same guy who talked to me - the little quirks in the way he types are all consistent. And what's worse, when I searched his name on Twitter, I started seeing input from other women about him harassing them IRL. What the fuck.

TL;DR Boys and girls and everyone in general, look up the people you're thinking of meeting. Some of them might just be sociopaths.

EDIT: I love the discussion that's going on in the comments, even if a few of them are bending over backwards to try and justify poor behaviour from people.

dating,kfro9s,2020-12-18 19:19:55,Can we just admit that modern dating is unbelievably exhausting?,"Dating apps were supposed to make dating easy. 

But my god there are so many shitty people on dating apps. 

The challenges are different depending on your gender. 

For guys: 

Online dating is like being a being a stand up comedian except that instead of boos or getting tomato‚Äôs thrown at you, you are greeted with radio silence. You have to be ready with pictures that show case you as an interesting person, be armed with witty lines, great jokes, good stories to tell, and you get ghosted repeatedly over and over again. And all of this isn‚Äôt for America‚Äôs next top model. This is for your regular girl next door. This also reminds me of that LinkedIn post where someone ranted about how companies should expect you to go through five rounds of interviews if they aren‚Äôt gonna pay like google or Facebook does. 

For girls: 

Online dating is like being a shopper at a bazaar in Istanbul. You are greeted by several guys who whistle at you, tell you they got the best Turkish carpets and can offer you Turkish tea to buy them. Some people try to win you over by throwing Hollywood song and dance if you‚Äôre European or Bollywood song and dance if you‚Äôre south Asian or Kpop dances if you‚Äôre East Asian. While it is fun to look for some cool items, it‚Äôs exhausting to say no to several pushy vendors over and over again. Except, you can explore a bazaar for maybe a couple hours and then do something else that doesn‚Äôt involve pushy bazaar vendors. Dating apps are constantly buzzing 24-7. 

Then for both genders, the people you talk to are completely disposable. A man is lucky to get one match a week even if he gets ghosted. A woman can turn on her apps and be flooded with 30 matches in four hours and can freely reject all of them without any remorse. This reminds me of the picky employers on LinkedIn who get 500 job applicants for one job and still complain there are no qualified candidates.","Just call it what it is..

So I thought ok he likes my body. So we have sex again today and he asks me again if I go gym. I said yes I do and he responds with 'well what about your stomache'? I was abit taken aback by this, as it's the first time someone made a comment like that about my body. (I do have a stomache it's in proportion to the rest of my body but I still am quiet insecure about it) I played it off cool at first and said well yeah I'd love a flat stomache but I also love food too much to restrict my diet. So he said well you need to have self discipline and work for it. I was like wtf, I mentioned to him if he has a problem with my stomache and he waved it off and said he likes my belly but he said this as he wants to motivate his girl and make sure she looks good. I thought that was a shitty reason and I'm left feeling abit crap so wanted other peoples thoughts. Is it just a preference thing?

EDIT: I've read through most of the comments and wanted to say thank you all so much!!! Hugs to you all. I feel so much better now. He can go fuck himself. I have ended it and will not be seeing him again.

And to the people telling me to eat healthy and lose the stomache. No thank you. I am not obese. The stomache is here to stay. I have a good, healthy, functioning body. Just some stubborn fat around the midsection that doesnt want to go away. 

Thank you everyone once again. Heres to finding a good partner that will accept and appreciate me as I am.

So I coped with independent entertainment‚Äîmusic, video games, writing, etc. It wasn't until college when I decided, ""Screw it. I'm faking confidence."" I've made lots of friends since. I got into fashion and rocked a new style. I amped up my sense of humor. People are always surprised to know that deep down, I'm introspective and anxious. I broke out of my shell even though it felt forced at first, but I quickly realized how easily it became to connect with strangers. It's like they gravitate towards someone unashamed to be socially themselves.

**Dating Experience:** I was 25 when I went on my first date ever through Tinder. Then two more. Great conversations; one girl's a good friend today. But it'd been dry since. Before then, let's just say I had a meh approach with women I wanted to date. I later realized it's because more than half of my friends are women, and I was naturally a friendlier guy‚Äî*never* the flirty guy. But how could I help it? I'd been rejected so many times from crushes and flirty messages that my brain's been wired to believe I'm not even allowed to flirt‚Äîthat romance was for other people, not me. Flirting was never the first impression I wanted to make, because the biggest thing I wanted in a partner was a best friend.

**The Kiss:** This girl liked me on Hinge a month ago. I wasn't even looking to date, but she was kind of cute, so I matched. Fast forward past essay-long texts, common interests, and so much more, and we reach our first date. I wasn't that physically attracted to her, but we had so much fun. Second and third date, she became more beautiful to me the more we spent time together. Finally, the fourth...I never made a move the last three times because I'd been so used to rejection that I literally couldn't believe that someone I'm starting to like might actually like me, too.

We sat by this moonlit pool fountain in Chicago. She wouldn't stop talking about mundane things. I was quiet. She was fidgeting. And it hit me: ""*Oh shit, is she waiting for me?*"" So I asked her, ""Can I kiss you right now?"" Everything in my body remembered the weight of past rejections, of hands that pulled away, of seeing tall and handsome men with the girls I used to like, of my immigrant mother asking me why I'm not married yet, of silly excuses I told myself that no one would ever want to kiss me‚Äîbecause after all this time, why would they? And she said yes.

**And turns out we're both terrible kissers, so we're** ***both*** **out of practice lmao. But hey, that'll change soon. :)**

**UPDATE:** Weeks later, we're officially a couple! And to my pleasant surprise, we've both grown incredibly...um...*talented* with each other. Oh, the untapped magic that comes with practice and confidence. We're so happy together, and we're both in this for the long run. :)","Im so invested in your story, this is amazing, congrats! And dont worry, everyone's first kiss is awful, it would be weird if it went great haha. I hope you and her keep on advancing, I feel very proud of you!"
dating,woycus,2022-08-15 12:25:30,"Unpopular Opinion: Most men are totally okay with waiting to have sex, but they're scared of being friendzoned so they feel pressured to make moves on dates","I have a theory that a lot of men, including myself, feel pressured to drive things in a sexual direction while dating or else we'll wake up to a ""I think you're a great guy, but I'm just not feeling it"" text message.

Like when I'm going out on a 2nd date, I'm thinking ""I better kiss her goodbye by the end of this date, or else we'll be entering friendzone territory.  Nothing is more anxiety inducing than being in the middle of a 3rd date without having pecked yet.

It's not so much that I'm some weird horn dog, it's moreso I feel like I have to make moves or else her interest will plummet over time.

Thoughts?","I've had a handful of dates that I thought went extremely well end up texting me afterward with some obviously made up excuse as to why they cant hangout again or they'll straight up tell me they aren't feeling it.

When I think back on those dates at first, I can't figure out why. We had great conversation, have a lot in common, so what's the issue?

I have great conversation with my barber. Do I want to fuck him? No. Great conversation isn't enough and in fact its expected that any functioning pair of adults should be able to converse and find commonalities.

Thinking back on those dates again, not once did I tell them they were pretty, not once did I attempt to be any amount of flirtatious, not once did I show any amount of spine or confidence in myself. Even if they don't want to go home with you on that first date, they at least know you are interested and sure of yourself. Don't be disgusting about it, but giving compliments, flirting, showing confidence and assuredness will go a long way."
dating,ogy4k9,2021-07-09 15:37:56,Met a girl at the psych ward,"**Edit: Added a huge header below the intro because many people will recognize the story. Everything below the header is what went missing for almost a year. It is also not identical to the original so it is worth a read :)**  


Hi everyone! This post was originally made almost a year ago but most of the actual text got deleted to many peoples frustration. I have got maybe 50 requests to write the story in full again. This is still not the original but somewhere close to it.

The story is 100% true despite some claims that it is fan fiction.

I have spent several weeks trying to figure out a good way to capture 5 years of memories into a single short novel. I feel like it is finally good enough to make public.

I have gone far down memory lane to recreate this. It was a wonderful experience. I hope someone appreciates it as much as I did <3.

***Met a girl at the psych ward, the final chapter***

**Not going to go into too much detail about how I ended up there but I was hospitalized for about 9 months after a proper mental breakdown. It was a place where we were focused on recovery so it was after the emergency stuff. So we were about 16 patients and probably around 40 staff. At first I was just too ill to really socialize. One of the staff asked me if I had met this girl yet. I said ""no"". She then said that it was the pretty one. I had no idea until a few days later when I met her. She was pretty and seemed quite healthy.**

**She seemed somewhat cold at first and I didn't really try to get to know her. Just assumed she wasn‚Äôt interested in talking. But at the hospital we had a lot of activities so eventually most of the patients were talking to each other‚Äôs. I think she started talking to me out of boredom after a couple weeks. I realized we had a lot to talk about and we actually got quite a lot in common. She was 23 at the time and I was 25. So we often just sat around in the living room talking for hours every day.**

**I started crushing on her a few weeks after that. So I tried to find ways of flirting with her without making it too obvious. So in the beginning we often sat together when going on a road trip etc. She flirted back eventually and we were basically together but I never kissed her. It wasn't really socially accepted.**

**The staff often told me that what we had was special and that I needed to stay in touch with her after I left the hospital. I thought I had found a girl that I could stay with indefinitely. She eventually left the hospital after staying there for 4 years. The time we got together wasn‚Äôt too much. 2-3 months maybe. I stayed for 6 more months after that and I lost contact with her completely.**

# The part that went missing:

**I never forgot about her although my crush for her gradually dissipated over time. I stayed at the hospital for another 6 months. I was done with treatment in the late summer that same year. I realized I still had her number, so I decided to call her. I told her that my sister just bought an apartment in her city and that I am going for the weekend.**

**She asked me where it was and I told her it was close to that. She told me she also lives close to that place! She then asked me the street name so I told her. She told me she lived in the exact same street. My sister lived in number 23. She lived in number 19. We talked on the phone for over an hour and caught up on events over the past few months.**

**Destiny seemed to have sided with me. We met up the next day and went for a walk. We talked about everything just like we used to do in the hospital. When I got back home that night, I dreamed about her. In the dream I was in love. I woke up and realized that this was what was going to happen.**

**I met her multiple times a week for the next 2 months. She visited my place several times even though it is about an hour from her place. Her mom picked me up one day and she introduced us enthusiastically. In October I decided that I was going to confess my feelings to her. I invited her on a proper date. She declined and told me that she didn‚Äôt think she was ready for a relationship. I later realized that I wasn‚Äôt really ready myself.**

**We met up about once a week on average and we usually hanged out for between 3-8 hours. We didn‚Äôt care about the time. We just went places and we talked. We made it a tradition to go buy bubble tea and made an agreement to try out every single flavour. It was probably 100 of them.**

**We often walked next to each other‚Äôs, bumped into each other‚Äôs, and held hands. We shared bubble tea as we were walking. It wasn‚Äôt too different from a relationship just without the kissing and sex part. We both got better over the next couple of years.**

**After seeing each other‚Äôs for 100s of hours over the course of multiple years, she told me one day that I seemed so much healthier than I did when we first met. I told her that she seemed happier, prettier. I had lost 12kg during those years and we had both more or less quit our medicines.**

**She moved out from her moms apartment and bought one of her own eventually, next to my sisters apartment. I got myself a new flat as well in my city. She got herself a dog and I got myself a cat.**

**It was summer. We started meeting a lot more often because of the vacations and Covid restrictions. We went paddle boarding, bowling and I introduced her to all my friends which of course asked if we were together. She never denied it. She told them that she liked me a lot and I was never in doubt that the emotional bond we had was very deep and genuine.**

**You could say we started dating but it was more of a romantic nature than anything sexual. We went bathing together late at night in a local lake in the woods. We were completely alone. Looked into each other‚Äôs eyes but we didn‚Äôt kiss. We lied on the grass in a local park under a tall tree and listened to music together. The new song ‚ÄúBegging‚Äù was out. We listened to it with my earplugs.**

**She invited me into her apartment more and more often. We drank coffee together and talked for hours. One day right before the restrictions was lifted, I was at the mall with her and her sister to buy some groceries for baking. We both wore a face mask. While her sister was away to find something, she grabbed my face and adjusted my face mask. It was the most romantic thing. We glared into each other‚Äôs eyes for maybe a minute until her sister returned.**

**After that, she started asking me if I wanted to move to her city which I always had to decline because of my studies. But I told her that I could always move when I am done. We went looking for apartments together a few times just to test the idea. It has been over 5 years at this point.**

**Last time I met her, she suggested that I try to live with her for a few days just to see how it goes. She had just invited me in for a second coffee after being out for around 3 hours. We lied next to each other‚Äôs on her couch, talking and staring at the roof. Looking at each other‚Äôs.**

**I was bumping into her feet with mine. I removed one of her socks and started massaging her foot a little. She didn‚Äôt mind. I was about to kiss her, but she got stressed out, told me she was on her period, and we just ended up talking for a while longer instead. After some coffee, she grabbed a bottle of wine and told me that we should share it since it was finally some sun outside.**

**we sat down on a bench outside her apartment. The bench didn‚Äôt have a back. She sat down on the middle of it with one leg on each side. I did the same thing so that we were facing each other‚Äôs directly. A few people walking by assumed we were having a moment. And we did.**

**I played a song for her that I just discovered on Spotify (Ti amo). She told me that wasn‚Äôt the original and added the original to my playlist. We were sharing my set of earplugs. When I tried to turn it off after about a minute, my phone glitched out and I couldn‚Äôt turn it off whatsoever. I had to restart my phone.**

**She laughed her ass off but now she couldn‚Äôt get the song off her mind. She has a great singing voice. She started singing the lyrics to me in Italian. It is a hot Italian love song. We only had one glass of non-alcoholic wine before she kissed me.**

**I am meeting her again in two days. I will be living with her for 4 days and celebrate her birthday. Wish me luck!**

**Ps: To anyone interested, we are both demi sexual. We have talked about sex a lot actually, but it simply takes a lot to turn us on. We appreciate the emotional bond over anything else. Personalities: I am an INFJ and she is an ENFP.**

**This became quite the novel. Even longer than my original from almost a year back. I tried filling in the blanks, and I don‚Äôt remember every single detail from the original anyways. I don‚Äôt think my writing skills have gone totally to hell though, so I hope it is worth the read.**","Thank you for sharing this. it warmed up my heart. You sound like quite the novelist, it was almost like reading a story. I hope everything turns out well for you two!"
dating,n5o17o,2021-05-05 19:15:49,Maybe the reason so many of you have miserable dating experiences is you want stuff that only comes with time right out the gate.,"This is common as fuck on this subreddit regardless if your gender. All the great stuff I see people expecting in the initial phase of meeting someone: great sex, fancy dates, emotional connection, displays of affection, gifts, trust, exclusivity, feeling special etc. we all want all of this stuff. I want to spoil you, make you feel special and prioritized, go out of my way to do things to make you happy, be there for you and I‚Äôm sure most people want to do this for their partner. That‚Äôs the key word though ‚Äúpartner‚Äù. Why in gods name would you expect a total stranger to do or be any of these things? Would you? Fuck no. That type of shit is reserved for people you care about. So expecting it from someone else is just dumb. You‚Äôre shooting yourself in the foot. All these great things only come with TIME. A few dates is more than enough time to figure out if you‚Äôre attracted to someone but not nearly enough to develop most of the stuff we all claim we want.",Preach. I think sometimes people want to pick up emotionally where their last relationship left off. But like you said that only comes with time.
dating,in91h0,2020-09-05 21:08:59,"For the first time ever, I went out with a guy who didn‚Äôt try to sleep with me on a second date üòä","Don‚Äôt get me wrong, physical intimacy is really important to me in relationships, and I‚Äôm not opposed to having sex to test our chemistry. But for the past two months, I‚Äôve gone out on several dates where the guy would invite me to his on either the first or second date, and would go from the first kiss to shoving his hands in my pants in 5 seconds. 

Yesterday, I went out with this guy who invited me to the city where he lives (I‚Äôm from the burbs)... we met at a park. To gauge where this night was going, when I got there, I asked him if he lived nearby and he said ‚Äúnope, it‚Äôs a 30 minute bike ride‚Äù. He laid down a blanket for us to sit on. He had brought wine and so we drank and just sat and talked for a bit. We ordered food to eat at the park, and continued to shoot the shit. I must say that his eye contact was *intense* and if he had asked me back to his place, I don‚Äôt think I would‚Äôve said no lol but he never even tried to kiss me. We walked around the city for a long time, had a ton of laughs, and I felt a deep sense of comfort and familiarity around him which is weird for a second date. We found a bench to sit on near the lake, and we continued to talk. He had his arm behind me, and he would occasionally rub my shoulder or arm with the backs of his fingers, but he never tried to force anything, nor did he shift the conversation to be overly flirty. He walked me back to where I was going to catch my Uber and waited with me‚Äî before I got into the car, he gave the best hug and kissed my forehead and thanked me for coming down. 

I never thought I‚Äôd be so smitten by a guy who seemingly barely tried, but everything about last night was so great. I went home feeling so excited about the fact that he enjoyed talking to me and being around me, and not just wanting to get me out of my pants. 
I do hope he invites me back to his for our third date though. :)",I am a male and I wish my partner would feel like this. Goals right there.

""Um, what?""

dating,pkfj3z,2021-09-08 17:51:21,The hardest part about dating is accepting the things you find out about yourself.,"If there is one thing I learned over 15 years of dating, it's that the perceptions we hold regarding our own behaviours, wants and needs can often be flawed or skewed to a degree that consistently cripples our dating life.

Currently I'm in a relationship, and have been for the last 8 months... but before January, I had been single for 3 years. Not truly single.... I had been on dates with quite a few men, I had dated 4 or 5 different people for short bursts of time before things got too serious and someone bailed or got cold feet. But I felt lonely pretty much all the time. I was convinced that the dating world was a problem, and that I was the ONLY ONE who could see how miserable it was. I'd come home and cry about how i'd be alone forever, and badger my siblings to be honest with me about why I wasn't ""marriage material"" or why I wasn't worthy enough for love. I grew resentful of the whole dating platform, I played the blame game by trying to stick it on men as being the problem, and then I blamed dating platforms, and then I blamed myself for not being skinny enough, or pretty enough, and then I blamed society for making me feel that way.

It took me a while to realize that every date was an opportunity to learn a bit more about the real me. Over the course of a year before I met my boyfriend, I really analyzed the process of my dating and came to some really uncomfortable conclusions about myself;

1. I'm not a perfect 10, let alone a 8 or a 9. I'm perfectly average, and perfectly suited to someone out there... but in my early twenties... whenever I got rejected I would take it so personally that I would automatically assume that the person I was on a date with was an asshole. This was due to the fact my parents made me feel like no one would ever be good enough for me. If they didn't want me it only made me want them more, as if they had simply made a mistake and would soon fall madly in love with me. The harsh reality was that often those men simply didn't find me attractive enough, not just in looks, but in other aspects like how I dressed, how i was shaped, how I spoke, my goals, my personality, my beliefs.... and instead of accepting that people have every right not to want me, I refused to see myself as anything other than a total catch and would be fiercely angry over it. I thought I deserved a relationship that was found in story books and movies. I thought that winning at life meant getting the whole package that you see in celebrity magazines. The guy with the striking good looks and emotional sensitivity and wonderful bank balance. But I never realized how unsustainable those standards would be. I didn't realize that I had an average job, and had a nice... but average body, and a nice... but average face. There was nothing supermodel about me, I didn't have a successful business to boast about or a charisma that draws people to me. Yet, I was looking for that in men. It was essential for me. It took me a while to notice that I was actually quite a clingy person to my partner, I was someone who needed constant reassurance over the fact they wouldn't leave me. I couldn't handle my own emotions and I made up stories in my head about them cheating on me. I was someone who was trying to have a perfect exterior despite struggling to ever feel worthwhile to someone. I believed someone would just have to ""accept me"" and ""work around my flaws""... but also be perfect and put together themselves. I hurt many good men by viewing them in this way, and it sucked to accept that about myself. I made quite a few changes in my life for the next few years, starting with how I placed value on people, and I also asked myself what I brought to the table.... and increased my own value by developing better communication skills, hobbies and independance so I could bring forward a life that someone would be eager to share with me, instead of me just fitting into theirs like a puzzle piece.
2. On the opposite side of the coin... I also realized I often dated certain types of people in order to get the approval of the other women in my life. I was a people pleaser to the extreme. I was hanging out with friends who had some of the most terrible and shallow outlooks on romantic partners. They would make fun of men who were balding, or pity the guy who wasn't making 6 figures, or who was too short or too stocky.  They would date multiple people at once and laugh about the anxiety they would cause these men just to gain some sort of upper hand in making them jealous. So I asked myself... would I date someone who had friends like mine? Would the ""good man"" that i'm looking for be excited to hang out with the people I surround myself with? Do potential partners look at me and think ""yikes, if thats who she surrounds herself with... she must agree with them to some degree"". After an embarrassing evening where I caught my date grimacing at my friends as they took selfies and ignored his polite questions.... I ended up dissolving these friendships slowly out of my life, and actually ended up friendless and quite afraid of how empty my social circle was until I engaged in hobbies and group events that better suited my interests and goals. Now most of my friends are married mothers or career driven women with long term partners... and they are a much better support system as they share my values. But it wasn't easy to accept that I was surrounding myself with people that did not share my values, and therefore hurting my own chances of finding the person I wanted.

So while the dating world is savage and cruel in many ways, and while it felt like everyone I met just wanted a quick lay or a ego stroke... something that helped me find my current partner was to accept that I was the other half of all my dating decisions. I was the one choosing to go on dates with people who didn't represent my values, I was the one saying yes to friendships with people who had no interest in the goals I had in life. I was the one dating certain types of people in an effort to impress or show off. I failed to recognize that I came to each date with my own set of flaws and failed to recognize that I'm not everyones cup of tea. I also realized that there are factors in life I have control over, and that being surrounded by unhappy people, or having an ex clinging on to your life like a bad smell will often come across to people as being a red flag... and that if I expect someone else to have good, healthy friendships, and be free of baggage regarding their past partners... that surely should also apply to me.

In short, become the partner you want to have... and that person will undoubtedly show up.",Quite impressive posting on your self awareness and learning.  Thanks for sharing that exposition of wisdom.

dating,jqwp3m,2020-11-09 12:26:08,Middle aged men who date teenagers are weird af,"I‚Äôm in my early 20s and I met a 38 year old man via dating app. We were talking about past relationships and such and I decided to test his maturity. I asked him if he would ever date an 18 year old. He said yes, if there were a connection. If you‚Äôre 38 and willing to date a senior in high school, then that‚Äôs crazy af. Needless to say, I broke it off with him. I don‚Äôt trust him at this point. ","I think the issue here isn't necessarily legality. 

It is legal. But there is probably a moral issue, regardless of gender. Personally speaking, I could never date someone who was 4 years younger than I am (26F). There's going to be a gap in maturity and wants/needs. I don't think I would feel fulfilled by someone who is still learning who they are as a person. 

When I see huge age gaps, especially when the younger partner is 18-24, I worry about them. They're still trying to learn and become proper adults and are generally easier to manipulate. It might not be true for EVERY 18-24 year old but I do worry about them, regardless. There can be very unhealthy power dynamics and most younger people have trouble picking up on manipulative or abusive behavior because, quite simply, they lack the experience. 

As long as the relationship is healthy and the younger party is headstrong and confident, I don't necessarily see an issue. But I always advise people to be cautious in dating older people just simply because of the instances I've witnessed not turn out for the best..."

dating,h9wzss,2020-06-16 04:57:10,A quick note on phone use,"This past weekend, my (23F) boyfriend (23M) of a few months and I went for a little getaway at my family's cabin, just the two of us. It was all wonderful, but what I want to point out as oddly amazing to me was how little he used his phone.
We got there and I grabbed his phone to take a picture, and I asked why his brightness was so low. He said it was because he forgot his charger, and I told him he should have said something when we swung by my place on our way out (our phones have different chargers, but I do have one that would have worked for him). He shrugged it off very casually and said ""I don't plan on using it anyways, I'm here with you.""
I didn't realize how sweet of a gesture it was until he said it. For the rest of the weekend we would go on a walk, for example, and he would never take his phone. He focused on me and us.

Just thought I'd share that those little things really prove you're paying attention and show where your priorities are!","This. One of my exes irritated the shit out of me by always being on her phone. Like what could be so fucking important that you're looking at your phone when you should be present with your partner, who took time out the day to meet you face to face. Unless you are expecting an emergency work or family issue, there is zero excuse. When I'm out on a date, my phone lives in my bag."

dating,hsur2j,2020-07-17 12:24:38,"Dating alot on tinder, have really made me realise how many guys needs to see psychologist ASAP.","The last 4 of first time dates I been on, the guy overshared his personal childhood trauma and mental problems etc. I literally had to sit with them  to prevent a mental breakdown. The oversharing came literally out of no where.

I know people looks at this differently, but I really don't think it is okay, to 'burden' someone you just meet with all your problems. Maybe they don't have many friends to talk to, but still.

I (27F) have seen a psychologist for the problems I had, but I really don't know many guys that do that. (I grew up with a emotionally and physically violent dad). Almost all girls I know who are troubled are seeing help, but no male friends I have are doing that. 

 I think it's really a huge problem, that many men don't seek help or therapy for mental health. The idea of traditional masculinity and being seen as weak is maybe the problem. What do you think?

Edit:
 I realise therapy isn't affordable for everyone, but there are stil options.

I started to notice that most of my male friends, never really talk about how they are actually doing. (they are almost lying to, an extent). Friendships are for hardships and being there for each other. No fake pretending and more guys needs to realise that. 

English is my third language.","as someone recently using tinder for the first time after a 10 year relationship and dealing with my issues with a counsellor I can say that oversharing is something I have had to fight against, for men discussing mental health is something that isn't done enough so when we start it is difficult to stop. 

trust me the next day they are kicking themselves"
dating,hh5w82,2020-06-28 01:33:37,"Movie, then dinner. Not dinner and a movie.","Everyone always says ""dinner and a movie"" but that's not a good plan, especially if neither of you are good at starting conversation. 

Think about it. You go to dinner, have awkward conversation over a meal, then sit quietly in a movie before going home.

Go to the movie first, and you have an immediate icebreaker. The movie. Get conversation going, and it's easier to jump into the about you kinda stuff. Not only that, but the last thing your date will remember is the fun conversation and good meal you just had.

Thank you for coming to my talk.

EDIT: So I see a lot of reasons why dinner and a movie are a bad thing, mainly ""You can't get to know each other during the movie,"" but in part that's the point.

Talking to people is a skill, and not everyone is good at it. To everyone suggesting this where it is you, the other person, and basically nothing else, I think you're missing this point. The movie first is meant to give you an entire movie with of things you can talk about to get the conversation started.

For the people saying ""dinner first, in case they're a creep so you can leave"" you can leave during a movie too. But awkwardness in conversation can be taken as creepy even if it's just a lack of knowledge on how to have a conversation.

To those saying I forgot the word ""Ted"" I know :p it was on purpose.","How about no movie or dinner as an early date?

Movie: you can't talk. you are stuck with someone who sucks if there is no chemistry

Dinner: $$ early on for someone you don't know yet. bad body language = sit across the table, very stifling.

Do an activity instead. Bowling/mini golf/pool/walk. Now you have your immediate ice breaker, conversation will get going, and gives you more chances to flirt"

That's absurd. As a dude, if I'm not interested in the conversation because all I'm getting is two word responses and no questions from me, I'm gone.

I ask my other (F) coworker if she‚Äôs flirting with me and she says she‚Äôs pretty sure she is. 

Well my hot water heater was out and I brought it up in a group conversation and she offers me to take a shower at her place. I said I‚Äôd probably just power through my cold shower or go to the gym if I really needed a hot shower. Then I thought about it and thought ‚Äúyou know what? Screw it, I‚Äôll take her up on the offer‚Äù. So I approached her later in private and said I‚Äôd take her up on the shower. We exchange info, finish our shifts, I head home to eat cereal. 

I pack a shower bag and bring some condoms because I‚Äôm thinking things might go down that road. She invites me in and shows me around, then leaves to take her daughter to school. I finish my shower and she texts me saying I can leave the house (unlocked) or I can stay if I want until she gets back. I choose to stay. She comes back and puts something on Netflix while we hang out on the couch. I‚Äôm pretty awkward but I asked her if she wanted to ‚ÄúNetflix and chill‚Äù and she said YES, and I went over to my bag and said ‚Äúcool, I brought stuff just in case.‚Äù She says to me ‚Äúoh, you mean like snacks?‚Äù To which I reply ‚ÄúUhhh‚Ä¶ condoms?‚Äù

Ladies and gentleman, she did not want to sleep with me at all. 

‚ÄúCONDOMS? Wha made you think I wanted to *sleep* with you?‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause YOU DO!!‚Äù

And other back and forth about the logistics of ‚ÄúNetflix and chill‚Äù, how unusual it is to invite someone to be naked and bathing in your own home, etc.

Anyways. We had a laugh about it. I apologized multiple times for making things awkward. She said it was cool and said we should get drinks sometime. I drove home and cursed my luck, felt foolish, and went to bed. üò™

Initially things were really balanced and he seemed equally invested. Cue the slow fade. I knew it was happening so as a last ditch effort to communicate and get answers, we finally met in person for dinner. That evening he tried to toe the line of ""I like you so much, but I just got out of a relationship a month before I met you yadda yadda yadda...I'm conflicted because I really like you but I can't give you what you want"". I've been in that spot, I booked it out of there. He told me he was ""disappointed"" and I told him I was *not*. 

Less than two weeks later, an acquaintance friend of mine asked me out. We've only been out once but he was already planning our next date \*on\* the first date. Texts me all the time, asks after me, does things he knows I'll appreciate - there is no question in my mind that this dude is into me. And he's in the process of letting me in. Today he left a little jar of chocolates on my front porch with an encouraging note just because he knew I was stressed with school work. When I texted him about it, he told me he was trying to think of something ***all day*** to help lighten the stress I was carrying.

His profile pictures are all from this month. And one of them is a picture I TOOK on OUR date.","[Original post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/jsytqo/i_22f_had_a_bad_gut_feeling_about_the_guy_21m_ive/)

&#x200B;

Well here's my update. I feel like my life is a movie. It's a long one so hang tight.

&#x200B;

So I confronted him about his Tinder profile. I showed him screenshots of his recent profile pics and also the one that I took of him when we were at the beach together. He admitted he did download it for a day because we've been fighting a lot but he felt ""too guilty"" and deleted it straight away. He said he never went through with anything because his conscience kicked in and he knew it was a selfish thing to do and that he regrets it so much and if I could ever forgive him he would do anything to make it up to me again because he feels so bad.

&#x200B;

Even if this was true. It doesn't excuse his behaviour. It doesn't excuse his actions of downloading Tinder and updating his profile pictures. He said he ""didn't go through with anything""??? That just means he was talking to girls. I told him I'm done with him. His last message to me was him telling me how sorry he was and how bad he feels and how much he regretted it and that he wants to let me know he really does love me and care about me. No he doesn't because if he did he would never have done that in the first place.

&#x200B;

I found out on Thursday. I ended things completely on Friday. I've been fluctuating between knowing my worth to crying a lot. How can someone do this? How can you tell me you love me every night before bed and do that?

&#x200B;

Well, here's where it gets worse. I've been thinking about all his words. Lies, really. Did he really only download it recently? Or did he have it all along? Did he really delete it after a day?

&#x200B;

So I did some digging. Long story short I discovered one more girl who he was talking to on and off  since July! I met him in July! She even noticed that I commented on his instagram pictures and asked him about me but he told her I was just someone he used to talk to! Then, I met another girl and she told me they met on Bumble on Tuesday!!! So he even had a Bumble account!! I only found out about Tinder on Thursday. She told me she's been talking to him everyday since Tuesday and they met up and went for a drive on Friday night!!! I ended things with him on Friday morning! What a scumbag.

&#x200B;

He's a narcissistic, lying, manipulative asshole who only cares about himself. I gave him my last words and told him he needs help. How does he sleep at night? How does he live with himself lying to so many girls? What was he going to do with the Bumble girl? What if I never found out about his Tinder? What a selfish little ass of a boy. He is now blocked and deleted off everything and I am going to thrive without him in my life.","If you've been fighting and he downloads Tinder even for a day. It shows he has potential to cheat on you.

He's actively went out to look for someone else. Even  if it were for just a day or a few hours. The fact he had the intent to do it from the start. He knew what he was doing.

When people fight. They make up. The fix things to move forward. He downloads Tinder hoping to replace you.

Youre worth more than that."
dating,muum07,2021-04-20 16:45:07,"I thought I'd been ghosted, but as it would turn out he'd just passed away over the weekend and I didn't know until 3 days afterwards.","   The guy I'd been dating for the past 3 months passed away over the weekend on a trip that I was not with him on. We'd talked about marriage in kids in depth. He was only 31 and he had so many plans and ideas. We hadn't even gotten to the point where we ""defined the relationship"". We'd decided 3 months would be a great point wait it out to see if we matched well, and we were only a week shy of that. I'd been spending whole weeks at a time at his house with him and he lived alone. 

  Part of me is still in so much disbelief. I didn't follow him on any social media platforms and nor did we take any pictures together. Neither of us used social media like that, so there wasn't much of a point. We were both very private. That being said I never met any of his friends or family either, so when he completely stopped talking to me for the first time in 3 months I had no idea where to even start asking. I did think he had ghosted initially, but I knew that wasn't like him, so I combed through what little I could find everywhere and anywhere. 

   None of his immediate friends or family were on social media. I'd only learned of his death from a facebook post his cousin had posted a day ago. They knew he was gone on Sunday and I didn't find out until today. 

 He didn't even tell me where he'd actually gone. I thought he was at a dance competition, but it turns out he went with his friends to a small private birthday party for his tight knit friend group. At this point I'm wondering if I was actually as close to him as I thought. Could I even deserve an invite to the funeral? 

I don't know what to think or how to feel. This is the first time anyone this close to me has died. I've not even experienced a close family members death before. I am only 23 and I've been so blessed. 

Tldr; How do I move on from someone who I'd grown so close too after their passing? It wasn't long enough of a relationship that we had a title, but it wasn't a short amount of time either.

**Update**: Today is day 2 of the loss and the devastation left with me has made it difficult to even eat. I did reach out to his cousin and he passed along his mother's phone # (without my asking for it). Part of me was so shocked that she even wanted to talk to me. I have no idea what I'm going to say to her. I spent all of last week with her son. Every. Single. Day. 

And I'd thought I'd be waking up to him even just this morning. He lied to me, yes, but I know that I would've been the first person he came to see after he got back, if he'd made it back. He didn't stop talking to me up until the point that he'd passed. He'd made me his priority in so many ways the past 3 months. I will be forever grateful to him for the example he'd set for me. The next man has very big shoes to fill. Thank you for your advice and your condolences. Sorry I can't share more details, but as many of you know so many pieces of  this story aren't even mines to share. I shared with you only what was important to my perspective and reading through your replies has helped me to validate my feelings. I did seek professional help, but only time will heal this gaping hole. I hope you all got something from my experience as well.",This might be above reddit's paygrade.

dating,mtdzb6,2021-04-18 14:36:12,"Why she doesn't just say ""no""","I've seen a lot of posts recently about men complaining when women won't give them an outright ""no"" and even urging women to do so if they're not interested. So I'm here to give some explanations as to why women don't (and often shouldn't).

1) Safety: too many men take outright rejection very badly, with responses going from yelling (I've experienced this one) to threats and outright assault. It's also very difficult to tell if a seemingly nice, stable guy is going to flip out on you, so playing along and then dropping off the face of the earth is often considered pretty much the safest option.

2) Social conditioning: Women in most societies are expected to be caring and nurturing, which makes it psychologically difficult for them to be assertive and reject someone to their face. A hesitant, ""well, maybe"" may be as harsh as some women can get.

3) ""No means yes, yes means anal"": As this Yale fraternity so eloquently puts it, even when being told ""no"", too many men interpret this as ""try harder, she's testing you"". So what's the point? Just say yes and ghost. (See point 1.)

Yes, being ghosted sucks. You know what else sucks? Fearing for your safety. So next time a girl stops answering your messages after agreeing to a date, don't be mad at her. Be mad at the assholes whose behaviour means this is the safest option.","I actually posted on here last week complaing about a girl ghosting me hours before our date. I did not call/text or blow up on her. I just went about my day and said oh well kind of thing. That was last Sunday. 

She texted me Tuesday apologizing and saying that she got nervous and bailed. She went on to explain she has had a really traumatic experience with s guy several years ago and has a hard time trusting them since. 

I said that I understand and was willing to give her all the time and space needed until she felt ready to see me again. She said she really liked what she saw and wanted to see me again. I said I did too.

She texted me Thursday and wanted to see if I was free at all this weekend. I always am lol. We went out Friday and had a blast. She kissed me when I dropped her off. I said ""if youre ever feeling anxious or anything, just let me know but don't disappear because I want to see you more"". She said, ""I think we'll be okay now""."

She then proceeded to ask why I was single, and I told her that I have spoken to some girls recently, but I wasn't really into them and they weren't into me either, and told her that maybe those girls just weren't interested in what I had to offer.

dating,j2ldid,2020-09-30 12:42:38,A male coworker asked why I‚Äôm still single,"I get this question a lot. It‚Äôs usually from men-married men that aren‚Äôt completely happy in their marriage. He‚Äôs asked it several times and has shown interest in me (that I shut down quickly-I don‚Äôt mess with married men). I finally laid it out for him  

I‚Äôm a working woman- I make my own money, I own my own home, own my car, have savings and I have my amazing pup for companionship. So I‚Äôm not looking for a man based on what he has. I‚Äôm looking based on who he IS. I want a companion, a partner, a best friend. Someone who I connect with deeply. Someone who want to go on the journey of life with me. Someone who brings me more peace than stress.

And I‚Äôm looking for a man who wants those same things in a woman. A partner, not a baby momma or a live in maid or someone to take care of them like their mommy used to. And most men around where I live want those strings attached

I talked with this coworker for almost 10 minutes about this, and *surprise surprise* he still didn‚Äôt get it. He said ‚Äòbut you‚Äôre so beautiful, you‚Äôd make a man so happy‚Äô.

And that says a lot- to him making a man happy is a woman‚Äôs responsibility, and she should be happy enough to just accomplish that :(

EDIT: I really didn‚Äôt expect this post to get as much attention as it has. There‚Äôs no way I have time to reply to everyone so I just want to add:

1. I have no problem with women who choose to do any of these things. There is nothing wrong with being a homemaker or keeping up the house or taking care of you significant other. My issue is with those who believe that is purely ‚Äòa woman‚Äôs job‚Äô, an exact phrase I‚Äôve heard many times before

2. I have had relationships with men who have had anything they could want monetarily, and I‚Äôve had relationships with men who have been at rock bottom and trying everyday to improve themselves and their situation. What they have doesn‚Äôt really mean much to me. That‚Äôs part of my point. It‚Äôs the journey forward that we‚Äôd be going on together that matters

3. This guy that this convo happened with was someone I had considered a close friend until he tried to pursue me.

dating,kpob0o,2021-01-03 17:12:01,Having to constantly start over with someone new is EXHAUSTING.,"This is a post mainly venting about the last 8 months of crap I've dealt with. Maybe people can relate.

I'm not used to the dating scene. I'm not used to going in and out of short term relationships. Up until around 8 or 9 months ago, I was always in long term relationships that lasted between 2-4 years (3 different relationships since the age of 17, I'm now 26). But when I decided to leave my last long term boyfriend due to being completely unhappy and spending the last 6 months of that relationship feeling miserable and alone, I thought finding someone new would be the best choice. I didn't think I'd be entering 8 months of utter disappointment and heartbreak.

&#x200B;

Guy one: I met him through a mutual friend (online). He lived around 10 hours away from me but we had a really great connection. Talked all the time, video chatted, played games together, etc. We made plans for me to take a trip up there to meet him and stay with him for a bit. When the time got closer, he started acting distant and weird, then when I confronted him about why he's acting so strange he basically freaked out at me and completely ghosted me. Since I never met him I wasn't too upset about it, just confused and kinda annoyed but oh well.

&#x200B;

Guy two: I met him on Tinder. We talked for about a week or so before deciding to meet up. Our first date was at the beach, then we had food and went back to his place (no sexy time, just hanging out). He immediately wanted to make plans for a second date. Long story short I saw him 4 times within just a little over a week, just to completely ghost me after he realized I was serious about not wanting to rush the physical aspects of the relationship. Which I made clear multiple times. Whatever, he was a jerk, didn't care about me as a person, just wanted to get laid. Got over it.

&#x200B;

Guy three: Met on OkCupid, later matched on tinder. We talked for a couple weeks in voice calls and played some games together before deciding to meet up. We had an amazing first date, he invited me over to his place 2 days later. Completely okay with going on my pace, etc. After that we became official. 6 weeks of pure bliss, him telling me he felt lucky to meet his perfect woman his second time meeting someone on the app. Just for him to one day breakup with me out of the blue because he realized he just wasn't capable of being in a relationship. He couldn't handle the commitment that came with it, and mentally didn't wanna be ""intertwined"" with someone for too long. Little backstory: He was 28 and never had a girlfriend before, never bothered trying cause he never felt the need. His friends basically pushed him to finally try. I was the trial relationship to see if he could actually feel ""normal"" and want/be in a relationship. Yay me!!!

&#x200B;

Guy four: Now this is the one that totally broke me, and that if you look at my profile you'll see a post that I made on here about a week ago regarding this man. Like the former, met on Hinge, chatted, had 2 video call dates before deciding to meet up. Had an amazing first date, it lasted 9 hours! Instant chemistry. We saw each other 2 days later, amazing time, was like fireworks. He wanted to make it official, so we did. FOUR MONTHS OF TOTAL MAGICAL BLISS. My god. I thought I met my soulmate. The way this man treated me, the things he did for me, the stuff he said to me... Telling me how he's never been happier in his entire life, I was everything he's ever wanted in a relationship and a partner (backstory: he went through 2 long term relationships that were toxic, neglectful, and had no emotional or even physical intimacy). To make things short: He told me he was in this relationship for the long haul, told me things that indicated we were going to have a long term future together, we spent so much time together like a real genuine loving couple. I TREATED THIS MAN LIKE GOLD. I was so sweet and loving, affectionate, supportive. we never argued, we always compromised. a week and a half before the breakup he wrote me a love letter about how I was the missing puzzle piece in his life, how he never had to worry about his future anymore because he knew I would be in it. 1 week before the breakup he gave me flowers. I hungout with his friends, I met his family and spent time with them often. I spent thanksgiving with them, Christmas eve, Christmas day... On Christmas he made me something that signified we'd be together forever. We made new years eve plans with his friends. Then.. 2 days later.. out of nowhere.. He breaks up with me. Then he turned completely cruel and cold towards me after that. It's like the man I knew never even existed. Treating me like I murdered his kitten or something. Put up with awful relationships for years and leaves a loving relationship that he expressed was so damn amazing in 4 moths. This was one week ago and I'm still feeling heartbroken over it. Even knowing he wasn't the man I thought he was, I still miss the illusion he played for me.

&#x200B;

Guys, I thought these last 2 men were the real deal but in the end they just played me like a fiddle and didn't look back. I have no interest in looking for another relationship anytime soon, but part of me feels afraid to look again. I'm someone who loves deeply and puts too much trust into people and I see the good in them while ignoring flags due to rose colored glasses... Sometimes I wonder if I was better off staying with the long-term guy I was with, but deep down I knew he wasn't healthy for me.

&#x200B;

Anyway, if you made it this far, thanks for reading. I know I'm not alone out there and everyone has gone through terrible situations at one point or another. It just all really sucks.

&#x200B;

Edit: I made this post nearly two months ago, and since then I've made yet ANOTHER mistake by following my heart instead of listening to my brain. But at the same time I feel like I was used and taken advantage of, so I figured I'd add guy number five to the list now incase anyone else ever stumbles upon this post. This post is like a relationship journal to me at this point lol!

&#x200B;

Guy number five: I ended up meeting him through reddit. Ironically it was due to this very post! He messaged me and reached out to show sympathy and to say that he totally understands where I'm coming from. He explained a little about himself and stated that he was looking for someone to talk to and hangout with every (or most) nights and since we're both gamers he asked if I'd be interested. Recently broken hearted and lonely me said sure, since it would be nice to have a new friend to spend time with, especially since most of my close friends don't play games. Long story short, we really hit it off and he PUSHED for a relationship. I really did like him, in my head I knew I should've said no, but my heart was hurting and I knew I would probably say yes to him eventually anyway (so yeah I guess it was technically rebounding if you wanna label it as that, but once I started mending my feelings from my breakup, I truly did really like him and the more we hung out and talked, the more I started to feel for him). ANYWAY, lets move along to over a month later, we planned a trip for me to meet him as he lived a couple hours away from me, and he gets cold feet and breaks up with me. I shouldve ran after this part but, the way he initially broke up with me was fucked up. he couldnt find the courage to be honest about his issues so he tried to lie and say that he had to take his younger sister in because her life was in danger as she was being stalked by a dangerous man ??? and his whole life would have to be put on hold. he dragged this lie out pretty well tbh. then I texted him something supportive and kind, cause thats how I am. and I guess he felt like a POS cause he called right after to come clean about everything. he took full blame for everything and apologized a lot. He told me he wished he didn't rush things with us, and that he should've been honest about his commitment phobia, as he's been like this for years and thought it would be different this time. However, he swore he was going to seek a therapist and get help, not only for his fear of commitment but due to his very bad depression and self loathing. 11 days later, after continuing to hangout and talk, he just completely ghosted me and deleted me on everything. He was getting kinda mean and weird anyway, saying shit about ""needing space from people."" In reality it was just space from me, even though I wasn't really hounding him or anything, and HE was the one who always wanted to hangout and talk. This dude went from being up my ass 24/7 for over a month. Calling me every morning, every night, on his way to work, on his way home from work, running errands, during his work hours when closing. Always wanting to video chat. Always gaming. He did a lot of big talking about wanting to meet up so badly, have me move there, wanted all my attention, told me I‚Äôd be an amazing wife and mother, wanted to get me pregnant for crying out loud. (was a fetish for him mainly). Went through the trouble of planning a whole trip for us to meet up.... then had a breakdown, freaked out, lied, hurt me... then wanted to stay friends, still hangout and game... to then blocking me. LOL. Meanwhile he said it was terrible how I was treated by past guys and he wasn't like them and he'd change my life... Then he ended up being even WORSE than them. Plus he knew I've been going through a very bad time in my life, my grandfather is near death and my life has been rough lately, and he just decided to hurt me a second time in the middle of all of this. I know this has nothing really to do with me, and everything to do with him, but that doesn't take away the pain that it caused. The only thing I'm to blame here for is accepting the relationship to begin with. Everything that happened here was due to HIM wanting it that way... But ironically all the time together is what drove him away and made him crack? But it's what he wanted? I DON'T UNDERSTAND?

I'm very tired. I'm taking a few months break from dating now.

&#x200B;

\*\*\* TWO YEAR UPDATE \*\*\*

&#x200B;

I haven‚Äôt updated this post in 2 years. At this point I‚Äôm kinda using this as my dating journal, but since this post is still getting views I mine as well update it.

Guy number six: around September of 2021 I found out I was moving to a different state. I subscribed to tinder gold so I can have travel mode and set my location in the town I‚Äôd be moving to. The plan was to let any matches know that I‚Äôll be relocating soon, and if they‚Äôre willing to wait or still happen to be single by the time I get there, that I‚Äôd love to meet them. I was surprised to see that quite a few people were okay with that. But by the time I got there, I was only interested in one. We had our first date a week after I got here and he became my boyfriend for the next 7 months. Things were pretty good. We saw each other practically all the time. I hung out with his friends, his family, and I did a lot for him. I compromised a lot for him. I really tried to make things work. But sadly, he hid some really important things about himself from me. The fact that he was a serial cheater. We went on a ‚ÄúEXCLUSIVE break‚Äù from May to the end of July. We were still in contact every day. Texting, phone calls. We just weren‚Äôt having dates or meeting up. When we tried to make it work again in August, I found out he was cheating on me with someone, and after a couple weeks when I found out, I let her know that he wasn‚Äôt actually single and the poor girl had no idea. We called and spoke on the phone and she ended things with him. During the blowout I also found out he was cheating on me during the first 2 months of our relationship. Along with the fact that he had also cheated on the two previous girlfriends that he had before me. So‚Ä¶ things ended, obviously. Permanently.

&#x200B;

Guy number seven: Now it‚Äôs February 2023. I wasn‚Äôt sure if I was totally ready to get back into dating, but at the same time I just wanted to see what was out there. I installed the apps, had dozens of conversations, but no one really screamed ‚ÄúOMG YES‚Äù to me. Until I matched with this one particular person. Lemme tell you‚Ä¶ I thank the Tinder Gods for leading this man into my direction because he is by far, the most intriguing man I‚Äôve ever met in my entire 28 years of life. He‚Äôs so different than anyone I‚Äôve met before. He‚Äôs so deep and has so many layers. I‚Äôm wildly attracted to pretty much everything about him. The way he thinks, the stuff he‚Äôs into, his hobbies, his personality, his character, his looks. I‚Äôm even pushing myself of letting down a certain barrier that I had up for so long, that I never really let down with anyone else I‚Äôve been with‚Ä¶ and that says a lot right there. I genuinely like this man and I‚Äôm hoping things continue to move forward. I‚Äôm drawn to him like a moth is drawn to a million flames, it‚Äôs fucking wild. I‚Äôm totally smitten.   I‚Äôm hoping that the next time I come here with an update, it‚Äôll be a positive one, and not another experience that‚Äôll have me reaching for the tissues and watching chick flicks wondering why I can‚Äôt find love like that.","Unfortunately, even as a guy it's not that different. Had many girls using me while they worked on getting back with their ex, talking to some other unobtainable guy overseas (who they had real feelings for), or waiting to travel. 

Eventually I deleted the apps and met somebody at my new job. And it's been pretty great ever since. 

I'd say instead of focusing your time on the apps, focus on overcoming your anxiety and learn how to approach guys or speak to them in person. It's hard, and you'll probably fuck it up a bunch, but it's a life skill that you'll cherish forever and there will be no looking back"
dating,jj67b1,2020-10-27 17:59:57,How to hit on girls while they‚Äôre working,"Don‚Äôt.

Seeing a lot of guys lately asking for advice on how to hit on a girl they like while she‚Äôs working (at a bar, restaurant etc.) best advice I can give is don‚Äôt do it, they don‚Äôt go to work to get hit on, it‚Äôs their job to be nice. Don‚Äôt be the creep who mistakes kindness for flirting.

Edit - if you‚Äôre 100% sure she‚Äôs in to you then go for it but is it ever that certain? What I‚Äôm trying to say in this post is don‚Äôt be trying to move on the girl based on the fact that she‚Äôs smiled at you and is being nice.

Edit 2 - ironic how it only seems to be men disagreeing with me on this. With this post actually coming from a man I‚Äôd of thought more of us would be able to see the logical side, clearly not, there‚Äôs a time and a place, their work isn‚Äôt it.

Edit 3 - literally just seen a post from another guy copy and pasting this but switching the roles around, why are yall so salty over this üòÇüòÇ",Everybody‚Äôs different. But I operate on the assumption that people don‚Äôt want to be hit on at work.

I'm trying to find a legitimate relationship, not a transaction, I can have all the free porn I want if I wish and if I wanted to pay for sex then I'd go somewhere more reputable than someone I randomly find on bumble.

dating,gq245i,2020-05-25 01:52:42,Having someone who wants to spend time with you is so underrated,"This might sound totally obvious, but it's so nice when you meet someone who actually messages/calls you first. And wants to spend time together. I don't like to always be the one trying to initiate seeing one another. A simple ""want to hang out?"" from a girl and then like actually spending a good amount of time together without feeling like either one of you wants/has to leave.

I don't know. In my experience as a guy I've often been the one to ask someone if they want to hang out it feels like. Not always but pretty often I think. And it's nice when someone else expresses interest in you.

I think that I had specific memories as a kid/teenager when there were times when I got blown off or ended up by myself somewhere or something? Idk? All I know is that when someone expresses interest in talking to me and seeing me it brings out the best in me and makes me feel so good.","As a girl I struggle with knowing how often to initiate without seeming clingy or desperate, even when I really like someone. I try not to overthink it, but I‚Äôve been in situations before where I feel like I initiated maybe 40% of the time and felt like it didn‚Äôt really make him more receptive (more like the opposite), which now has made me really hesitant. Any tips on how often to initiate vs when to hold back?

Edit: thank you all so much for responding! I‚Äôve been feeling super down but it‚Äôs awesome to know other people were having these same questions."
dating,ql7asp,2021-11-02 15:55:55,"I (F25) do not put out until I'm 100% sure the guy is into me. I'll wait 6 months, a year, several years to have sex. My friends tell me this is why I'm still single","Ok so I'm one of those ""boring"" people that don't do casual sex. And the reason is that having sex with a guy makes me attached and it feels like mental torture to get attached to someone who isn't into you.

So if I'm dating someone I won't put out on the first 3-4 dates. I'll wait until I'm 100% sure the guy is into me. This can actually take a year or longer.

I have male friends who say they will have sex with women and then ghost them. So that kind of talk has made me scared to have casual sex. Its not for me. However my female friends say me not putting out fast enough is the reason I'm still single.

Are they correct? But what about those women that put out on the first dates? They're still struggling to find a partner.

I just don't know anymore what is right to do.",">But what about those women that put out on the first dates? They're still struggling to find a partner.

Dating is struggle. You can do everything right and still struggle. Dating is also competitive. Sexual attraction/compatibility is very important for a long term relationship and therefore highly valued. 

>So if I'm dating someone I won't put out on the first 3-4 dates. I'll wait until I'm 100% sure the guy is into me. This can actually take a year or longer.

1) There's a grand canyon of difference between 3-4 dates and a ***year or longer.*** It doesn't sound like you actually have a rule or procedure here. 2) It would be impossible for almost anyone I know to maintain a year long relationship without having sex. Sex is necessary for most adults. If I'm seeing a woman for over a month and we still aren't sexually active my assumption is going to be that her level of attraction towards me is low. 

>I have male friends who say they will have sex with women and then ghost them. So that kind of talk has made me scared to have casual sex. Its not for me. However my female friends say me not putting out fast enough is the reason I'm still single.

Every guy I know has also been ghosted after sleeping with someone. It's not unique to any gender it's just part of dating. Some people are just shitty that's why you need good screening. But you've overcompensated for your fear by screening out basically everyone. It's not that you're not ""putting out"" (gross phrase btw) fast enough it's that ***you're afraid to be vulnerable and it's manifesting in your sexual behavior.*** 

>I just don't know anymore what is right to do.

If you want a change in results you need to change your behavior. I kept getting burnt so I adjusted my screening. Just having sex sooner isn't going to solve the deeper issue - *you need to find a way to feel comfortable being vulnerable and then the behavior will follow.*  

Don't force it, don't rush it. It's a personal project for yourself. Good luck!"

My girlfriend (F28) and I (M30) have been dating for 6 months now and it‚Äôs the happiest and healthiest relationship I have ever been in. She is just such a calm and happy presence in my life. She doesn‚Äôt get upset when I‚Äôm gaming, she listens to me talk about my interests regardless if she cares or not but she never makes me feel dumb for it which has been an issue in the past for me in past relationships. 

We‚Äôre both pretty introverted, she likes her alone time to read, she will bring books or her kindle to read when we‚Äôre hanging out in my room and I‚Äôm playing, she‚Äôs reading but we‚Äôre just enjoying each other‚Äôs company. I‚Äôll never forget that first time, I think I almost cried when we sat in silence on the couch enjoying our different hobbies while being close together or when she lays her head on me. She fully trusts me and doesn‚Äôt blow up my phone when I‚Äôm not with her, she gets along with my parents and my friends. 

I love how excited she gets taking her to target or Barnes and Noble and getting her iced coffee and a book and listening to her ramble and vent about what she‚Äôs reading.

Edit: Whoa, I did not expect all these responses and for this to reach a lot of people. I hope this didn't come off as empty platitudes because this really just came from me being too in my head- asking myself if he's still into me (for the hundredth time), or if I should reach out one last time (again, for the hundredth last time). This is not about him. This is not me begging or asking him to see and treat me how I want to be treated. This is walking away from something that only causes me negative feelings I do not need.

dating,tz6t5d,2022-04-08 16:01:04,Why are women judged more harshly for their sexual history than men ?,"
I‚Äôve seen multiple posts on Reddit where men are bothered when they find out their wives/girlfriend‚Äôs sexual history. I‚Äôve seen questions on Reddit where people inquire whether or not they‚Äôd be comfortable marrying a woman with a high body count. 90% of the time it seems the answer is ‚Äúno.‚Äù

Most women I know are ashamed to admit if they‚Äôve had one night stands or disclose their body count. 

Everyone is entitled to their preferences, but why does society still have this preference ? Or why do you have this preference ?","Not my opinion but from what I've discussed before;

In the dating world men usually are the 'hunters'. They have to go out of their way to get female attention, ask them out yada yada. If an average man does 0 effort, he gets 0 female attention. If they succeed frequently they're seen as cool.

On the other hand, women usually have much more male attention without trying too hard. If an average girl does 0 effort she'll still get guys trying to get to know her one way or another. You can even see that here on Reddit, where if a girl makes a spicy post or comment, their DMs explode. So a girl with a lot of experience is not seen as a 'succesful hunter' but rather someone who doesn't really filter and is 'easy' to get.

Again, not my opinion but just trying to answer your question."

At the beginning, you‚Äôre still getting to know someone so let yourself get to know them. Stop romanticizing situations or your future with them when you barely know them. 

For me what helps is when I catch myself doing this, I remind myself okay, what are the facts and what have they told me. Separate facts from feelings and your own projection!

This definitely has saved me from a lot of heartache (when things didn‚Äôt actually work out with them and I felt heart broken for the idea of them and not necessarily them as a person)","Definitely guilty of this.

Can be quite exciting to start getting to know someone new. Perhaps the little I do know about them is great. But I've certainly created my own idea of what this person is all about. It does tend to lead to a whole lot of disappointment  when you start to realise that most of the greatness about them was simply manifested in your own head.

To no fault of their own, they end up disappointing you.

Kind of interesting to reflect on past relationships and wonder if they envisaged you as something you're not?"
dating,i088ac,2020-07-29 20:37:57,"I guess the perfect summary of heterosexual dating struggles can be this: while men are dying of thirst in the Sahara Desert, women are dying of thirst in the Pacific Ocean.","Seems like there has been a lot of debates on which gender has it worse when it comes to dating. However, I can equally relate to to the dating struggles of both hetero men and women. While men are dying of thirst in the Sahara Desert, women are dying of thirst in the Pacific Ocean.

Many hetero men who are unsuccessful are often over looked by many women and are often left out of the dating pool no matter how much they improve themselves or make themselves be more attractable. Often times, they try their best to be the charismatic and charming person they were told to be; however, they are still shut down. As a hetero man who have been rejected more than the orphan kitten with rabies, I will say the struggle is real. Being constantly rejected by everyone no matter what you do would make hetero men feel quite lonely.

Many struggling hetero women may have more options; however, most likely, these options are terrible and they would rather be alone. I have heard multiple stories of women in my friendship circles and families who were hurt by the infamous pump and dump as well as being led on by men who were absolutely terrible people (according to me). In addition, I also heard stories of them being chased by creepy and dangerous people. Likewise, women are more vulnerable to gender-based violence than men. So the thought of being physically and emotionally harmed as well as being harmed by someone you thought you loved would make hetero women feel quite lonely.

While the struggling hetero man is being rejected by every woman he approaches, the struggling hetero woman is only being approached by terrible men. Likewise, a lot of heterosexual dating norms only harm us heterosexuals and we can learn a lot from our LGBTQ+ peers in this regard. Hopefully people are more empathetic with each other and their own unique struggles. Thank you for allowing me to lurk and I really enjoy reading the content.

Edit: Thank you for the constructive and informative comments and thank you for the gold. ","As a woman, I‚Äôve found using okCupid and focusing on (1) how people describe themselves and (2) the answers they supply to questions have been a great way to search for someone.

I believe what‚Äôs in your heart matters far beyond appearances. Focusing on values compatibility without focusing on appearance can help find those diamonds out there that others undervalue. 

And since okCupid requires a match before messaging, maybe women wouldn‚Äôt be inundated using that platform. 

I found a nice man a month ago who says I was the first girl to initiate to him in his years on the platform.

I wish all these nice people could find each other more easily. There are lots of good people out there if we can only find each other."
dating,h0mjrl,2020-06-10 23:00:42,I (24F) just love how my boyfriend (27M) says ‚Äòwe‚Äô all the time,"I think my friends are probably sick of hearing how much I love my boyfriend, but I honestly think he is the sweetest person in the world. Over the weekend we went on a road trip to his hometown with some friends and I noticed something that made me so happy. Whenever my boyfriend talks about his future, he always says ‚Äòwe‚Äô he might be talking about something simple like next weekends plans or something more serious like his next house, but he‚Äôll always say ‚Äòyeah *we‚Äôre* free next weekend‚Äô or ‚Äòmaybe *we* could live in ___‚Äô. I love the way he does it as it makes me feel so important and loved. 

While we were away, we had a bonfire and were all sitting outside drinking. I got tired and decided to go to bed, leaving my boyfriend outside with my friend. The next morning she pulled me aside to tell me how sweet he is and that he was absolutely gushing about how much he loves me and told her how he really wants to get engaged next year and adores me so much...it made my heart melt knowing how serious he is about me and how badly he wants our future together. 

I truly think I‚Äôm the luckiest girl in the world, he is so perfect in every single way and I can‚Äôt wait for our future together","True love is the best feeling one can experience. Mazel-tov. 

One of the best ways you can capture this exciting time in your life is to keep a journal or diary to write down your thoughts and feelings about your experiences. You could begin as easily as copy/pasting what you posted. 

A written account of your romantic journey could serve a number of purposes beyond posterity depending on your circumstances. For one, you could one day share your writings with your future spouse and enjoy a nostalgic moment of intimacy (maybe in your late 30s or 40s). By then you will have grown so much as people so it ought to be quite a moment."

He took me to a coffee shop and even though it was obvious by my body language that I wanted physical touch, he still asked for permission each time he touched me or kissed me. It almost made me want to cry because I've never been shown that level of respect for my body/boundaries and I didn't think I deserved it up until this point. It seems like the bare minimum, but most of the time you don't even get that.

dating,iouaz2,2020-09-08 14:14:31,I Advertised Myself On A Billboard To Get Dates - 1189 Women Applied,"**TL;DR - I bought a billboard to find a girlfriend, over 1000 women applied to date me, learned a ton in the process and it kind of worked**

I recently put up a billboard to find a girlfriend... ([Here's what it looked like](https://postimg.cc/v1Vn3K2r))

And over 1000 women ""applied"" to date me.

**How it all started...**

Dating apps have been very time-consuming. And while I've had some cool virtual dates, it still wasn't what I was looking for.

I‚Äôm quite entrepreneurial (already build and sold my first business) so one day this idea came up‚Ä¶ what if I build a marketing campaign to get dates during this pandemic?

If it doesn't work, at least you'll have a funny story to tell your grandkids!

I was lucky to find a billboard that was really cheap and heavily undervalued... and I went and did it!

**The plan**

The billboard would lead them to a website (DateLeon . com), from there they can fill out an application form that asks them some really deep questions as well as for their contact details & Instagram.

If I find them interesting I slide into their DMs, set up a phone call and from there, if we still like each other, we can go on a date.

**The more people see it‚Ä¶ the better my chances of success**

The billboard in itself wasn‚Äôt enough to give me the exposure I needed to find women I really liked (after all, it was located right next to a liquor store‚Ä¶).

But I knew it would make it a noteworthy story on social media that captures people‚Äôs attention when they see it.

So the question was - how could I incentivize them to share it with their friends?

Maybe some sort of giveaway‚Ä¶ a prize they can win if they do so‚Ä¶

What if I offered $5,000 to the person that shared this with the friend that ends up becoming my girlfriend?

This way I‚Äôd only have to pay if the entire campaign is successful and I meet someone SO amazing that despite having (potentially) many options, I only want to spend time with her.

I don‚Äôt just hop into a relationship with anyone, I‚Äôm very careful and patient. So a $5,000 prize that would get people to share it was a no-brainer.

Some people warned me about ending up with a gold digger. Little do they know I repel gold diggers because I‚Äôm a very frugal and simple guy.

**It went viral‚Ä¶ but not the way I wanted it to.**

The idea with the $5,000 prize worked like wonders! People shared it on their Facebook feeds, tagged their friends jokingly or sent it around via Messenger.

At the same time, negative comments were piling in‚Ä¶ and they kept increasing.

Quickly, it was shared over 2,000 times on Facebook alone.

People were accusing me of pedophilia because I used the word ‚Äúgirl‚Äù on the website (alongside words like women & lady), saying this was ‚Äòhuman trafficking‚Äô because I was ‚Äòbuying a human‚Äô through the referral fee and many comments trying to emasculate me.

I wish I could say it didn‚Äôt affect me at all, but at first, it really did. I learned a lot about myself and people throughout this process!

But at least the traditional media weren‚Äôt so harsh on me as I was invited on multiple radio shows, had a reporter come to my house and had articles written about me in multiple countries.

**So‚Ä¶ have I met someone special?**

Out of 1,000 applicants, there were very few I was actually interested in and I went on 15 virtual dates in one week.

They were almost all great - smart, funny and they loved the idea of the billboard. Most of them weren‚Äôt even referred by someone.

There was just one problem...

Unfortunately, the majority of them didn‚Äôt even live in my city, my state or even the US.

But either way‚Ä¶

It was a great experience, I learned a ton in the process and I‚Äôve even documented it all [on video](https://youtu.be/r4IZEf-uBdE) for YouTube. So even if nothing worked out at all, I‚Äôve had all these wins.

But I do have some good news for those who were wondering if this turns into a real love story after all...

After a series of events, there‚Äôs now a girl in my life that I really like and she already said yes to the most adventurous, epic & crazy date I have planned‚Ä¶

I don‚Äôt want to spoil too much for now‚Ä¶ so I guess I'll have to update you again later if you‚Äôre interested‚Ä¶

Wish me luck!

&#x200B;

**EDIT**: Because people mentioned it - no I'm not the first one with that idea and I'm aware of that. I was a little disappointed that it was done before (by at least 3 guys I know of) but I still went ahead with it.",How much did the billboard cost you? Dating hasn‚Äôt been going too well for me so I gotta keep all the options on the table.
dating,jfcli6,2020-10-21 13:16:31,If someone isn‚Äôt making time for you. Cut it off.,"Just coming from my most recent experince. 

We met over one of those dating apps and really hit it off. 

Talked constantly for at least a little while (about two months) and hung out a ton. Then I brought up the ‚Äúwhere do we think this is going?‚Äù Question. 

It was the nail in the coffin - I just didn‚Äôt realize it at the time. 

It changed our entire dynamic. She completely pulled away emotionally and that was the end honestly. 

I did my best to salvage things. I gave her the ‚Äúspace‚Äù she wanted but in reality she just didn‚Äôt want anything to do with me anymore. 

I called her last night & we spoke briefly and I told her I wasn‚Äôt going to put anymore time or effort into it & that‚Äôs it. 

If someone does not make a conscious effort to want to talk to you and see you. Then do not waste your time on this person. Find someone who appreciates you. 

The most important thing you can do is completely cut things off. A clean break. Get rid of their number and remove them on social media. Save yourself the heartache. 

Dating is tough - but there‚Äôs plenty of great people out there. We‚Äôll all find someone.

Edit: a lot of very supportive comments below. Thank you for your kindness.",In my experience if you‚Äôre having to put in all the effort then it‚Äôs not going to work. The desire to spend time together has to be mutual. I‚Äôm sorry it didn‚Äôt t work out but it sounds like you made the right call.

Okay I appear to have been ghosted. Happens to lots of people..oh well. Back to the drawing board. Maybe 3 months later..I met other people during that time and forgot the whole thing ever happened. So one day I'm minding my business eating tater tots and get a random message saying ""Hey you. How has everything been?"" I reply with ""I'm Ok. Who is this?"" They respond with ""This is (name not important)..don't you remember me? Oh I see you must have deleted my number..oh wow whatever never mind..Smh."" 

At this point I could of just ignored it but I'm admittedly a king of being petty so I started thinking like nah I just gotta say one thing and I don't care how petty it is.. So I reply, ""What is the Smh for? Why are you the one shaking your head? You don't have the right. You ghosted me remember..I'm the one shaking my head right now. Between the two of us..I get to Smh..NOT YOU!! I didn't ask for your text out the blue..Smh! And I went back to minding my business.

The mind of a person I tell ya. What is the thought process behind that? Like yeah I totally ghosted your ass, and could possibly do it again at a moment's notice, but I'm back so let's live happily ever after. People are nuts..Has this ever happened to you?",People are weird and entitled.

- This person sent me three texts instead of two today, is it clingy behaviour?

- Hey reddit, i've had a very nice first date with this person but we didn't have any physical contact (sex or a kiss), is it bad?

Average dating advice: no, No , NO NOOOO!!!! Start violently making out or get them into bed right now and see if you're sexually compatible! If this person doesn't want to do it yet and it's a GIANT red flag and just find someone else.

- Met this person online and we talked for 3 weeks before deciding to meet up. The date went very well, i event went to it's place and had sex!

dating,qj0ozp,2021-10-30 12:41:43,I think I met my first cheap angry hypocritical male gold digger,"
I am 18F. Guy is 22M. Most bizarre date ever. 


So my family is well-off but obviously I don‚Äôt advertise this. My parents have actually warned me about male gold diggers before but I dismissed it then because it is not like I am chasing gorgeous male models much younger than me. Anyway I agreed to meet this one guy from Bumble for coffee because he seemed ambitious, funny, stylish and quite normal. 


We met in line and I was ahead of him. He looked visibly annoyed when I asked for a slice of cake with my coffee but relaxed when I paid for my own order. He ‚Äújoked‚Äù lots about me being a poor student and kept asking if I only got the ¬£5 cake because I assumed that he would be paying for me. Extremely rude and ludicrous but whatever, maybe he just had a bad experience recently. I got my cake and I was going to eat it. 


We made some small talk and then I asked him what he does for a living, which seemed to really trigger him. He sighed dramatically and told me how it is obvious why every girl asks this question, then bragged about how he is an engineer making mid five figures but it is getting so hard for him to weed out all the nasty broke gold digging sl*gs. He went on and on about how females these days only care about a man‚Äôs money, that we all just want to use nice guys for free meals but of course he is way too smart to fall for that. According to him 50/50 everything is the only way to go even if his girlfriend makes a lot less, because equality and it is not his problem that she isn‚Äôt smart enough to get a STEM career. He finished with how marriage is nothing but a huge scam for modern men, that he will definitely insist on a pre-nup to protect his assets and that anyone who has a problem with that is absolutely a gold digger.  


He looked super smug like he just totally called me out and was waiting for me to argue or to prove myself to him somehow, but I told him calmly that I agree completely with what he said about a pre-nup being extremely important and that if I ever get married my family will definitely insist on one. He looked really confused for a minute and then started asking all kinds of probing questions about my family and my assets. I know not to talk about wealth but this guy was such a clown and I most certainly didn‚Äôt want to see him again so I just told him that my grandparents are gifting me a beautiful house in a posh neighbourhood. 


He got extremely excited and immediately started asking how I feel about moving in there with a boyfriend because I am an adult now and it is time for me to stop living with my parents. He then moaned about how he has hefty student loans and still has to pay an exorbitant amount to live in a tiny flat further away from the city with two other guys. He gushed about how great the location of the house is and how much money he could save if he didn‚Äôt have to pay rent at all. He even had the audacity to ask if I would eventually consider giving my boyfriend co-ownership of the house since he can contribute by taking care of the garden and whatnot. He then confessed that in spite of his cynicism he is just a romantic at heart who believes that marriage is amazing with the right person and that when there is true love, pre-nups just feel so cold and one-sided especially when overprotective families try to intervene. 


He then started bombarding me with negs (?) like how I seem smart for a non-STEM major and look alright for a tall girl. He kept talking about our bright future together in ‚Äúour‚Äù house, that ‚Äúwe‚Äù have the money to retire early and travel the world and creepy stuff like how our kids are going to inherit his IQ. He was extremely pushy about setting up a second date on the spot and declared that he would even be willing to treat me to a nice dinner to show his sincerity since it is ‚Äúour‚Äù money now. 


I faked an emergency, left, saw him typing furiously on the app and blocked him immediately. Total psycho with no social skills and zero self-awareness. At least nobody is falling for that. 


TLDR: I guess guys who constantly cry about all women being gold diggers usually don‚Äôt have much gold and are totally projecting. Avoid!","I am not well off, but the amount of men I've met who generally have nothing don't even own their house who assume EVERY woman wants their money is honestly scary."

It doesnt mean she‚Äôs doing that with every guy she meets, and even if she was, as long as everyone is being safe, who cares? That doesnt mean she doesnt respect herself either. And why is it always the girls who dont have self-respect? I never hear people talk about guys who sleep around and say its because they dont have self respect. I respect myself and know my worth and that has nothing to do with how often I hook up.",I never understood this. And then these same people insulting these women will still sleep with them. Like???

You go on dates with three to five people simultaneously. 

Many cases you go on several dates with each of these people. 

You have to keep the text conversation going frequently or you run the risk of being ghosted. 

There needs to be constant ‚Äúchemistry‚Äù, ‚Äúbutterflies in your stomach‚Äù, and fireworks all the fucking time. It‚Äôs like you need a scene from the romance movie the notebook to see your dating life as promising to many people. 

Then if you survive this marathon of dating, you have to be very clear that you both are exclusive and then you need to turn down the others you went on several dates with. And my oh my people have such commitment phobia. People don‚Äôt want labels of ‚Äúboyfriend‚Äù or ‚Äúgirlfriend‚Äù. 

Dating has become as complicated as interviewing for a job at google...good grief. Why? The paradox of choice is you don‚Äôt choose anyone.

I was nervous and prepared myself for a date that wasn't a good match. I quickly realized I was wrong and enjoyed the few hours we spent together. Right off the bat, I was caught off guard by normal I felt around her; I wasn't anxious, I was relaxed.

It didn't take long for me to pick up on how interested she was in me. Although she didn't know it, she handed me several compliments that, in my head, have long been deep insecurities of mine. In fact, they were things none of my exes‚Äîor anyone I've dated before really‚Äîhas told me before. I didn't know what to say at first, but I felt *super* flattered. I've rarely been complimented with such sincerity. None of them were things I typically hear, but they're things I've always wanted to hear. It felt so nice.

I have no idea how things will unfold with her. That's not the point. If it lasts or if it doesn't, I'm beyond thankful for a date that gave me confidence in myself like never before. I was able to break from my first date cliches birthed from overthinking, and instead focus on the nice things that were happening in the moment.

dating,mu7qli,2021-04-19 18:57:51,Protect yourself against STDs and don't compromise.,"Decided after getting vaccinated and being single for 9 months to start dating again. Matched with a ""cougar"" who was 18 years older then me. She had been divorced since Jan 2020 but was estranged from her husband since 2017. She had some pent up frustrations and let me know that she was looking for something casual and had a thing for younger men. We chatted a bit more and she let me know that she was DTF. We talked about meeting up Friday for a drinks at a quiet bar (we are both vaccinated and cases are really low locally). I said that'd be great but I have two deal breakers, no more then two drinks before hand and that we have to use protection. 

She agreed to the two drink part but said that she didn't like to use protection and that she trusted when partners said that they were clean. I said that I know I am clean because I got an STD test two weeks prior and can prove it but I still want to use protection. She kind of grumbled a bit and said that she'd only been with her husband and two other men in the last year. I said wait you were still sleeping with your estranged husband and she said yes until September 2020. I asked if she had been tested and said that it was sometime in April 2019 after she found out that her husband had a meth problem.. She said some story about how she would get lonely and that she had needs. I said you're husband has a drug problem and how does he use meth.. She said with needles. BIG FUCKING RED FLAGS.

I was like you need to get tested immediately, she said that she doesn't need to be told what to do but would do it to prove me wrong. So she got tested and the rapid HIV was negative and would let me know when the rest of the results came back. Few days later I got ghosted.. Removed from Tinder and Snapchat. Either she found someone else or found something in her test. 

It's been 10 days now and I am so glad I didn't compromise on wearing protection. Stay safe out there everyone! Its going to be a wild wild summer.","I think this is the first time I've seen a ""I'm a guy and got ghosted for insisting on safer sex."" Nice to see this kind of gender equity!

dating,loz359,2021-02-21 15:17:00,I have made it my dating goal for 2021 to get rejected as many times as I possibly can,"I know it sounds like an outrageous goal but here me out. I've spend my whole life never trying with girls and rejecting myself before they had a chance to...Now my plan is simple. I'm actually gonna start trying to ask out girls, talk to them a lot more and try to date the ones I'm interested in. In order to get over that fear I have of being rejected, Ill just ask if they want to date me. If they say no so be it.

Luckily I have the gift of being able to easily cut off people in my life, so I can just move on fast if they don't want to date. None of what we do matters much in college after we graduate. So I thought why not just ask out as many women I'm interested in fully expecting to be rejected? Its the perfect way to go about this, since I've been single my whole life and have zero experience with the opposite gender. I will eventually become numb to rejection till I get so used to it and keep on trying and trying till I turn 30 years old.",[deleted]
dating,la4ulf,2021-02-01 14:55:44,"Five things you need to get dates on OLD and maintain sanity: Good photos, positive bio, unmatch on flakiness, ask for a date early and no lies","I'm an average guy, I'm on a few dating apps and I get all the dates I can handle (2-3 a month), here is what made a huge difference for me:

1. Have really good photos, *top notch quality*. Sharp, good light, good composition, good posture, etc. You want two head shots, two full body shots and two ""fun"" shots (quirky, group, with a pet, doing a sport, etc). No selfies, no mirror shots, no filters and no more than one group shot. No more than one sunglasses shot. No masks. Have a different outfit in every shot. Good light means that people can see the color of your eyes in the photo. Read about portrait photography, buy a cheap tripod and use the timer function. Hire a photographer if you have to. Put effort into this, it's super important.

2. Write an interesting, non-generic bio with no negativity, self deprecating or bitterness in it. Not even as a joke. So many people self-sabotage their dating prospects by having bitterness in their bio. Write about yourself, your work, hobbies, interests, goals. Be specific and *non-generic*. Avoid ""I'm down to earth"" and similar utterly meaningless phrases. Give the other side enough material to start a conversation with. Avoid ""Swipe left if you are XXX"" statements. *NO NEGATIVITY*. 

3. Unmatch early and aggressively on any sign on low-interest or flakiness. No reply for 48h? Never asks a question? Only replies in single words? The first message was ""hi""? Something doesn't feel right? Say goodbye and unmatch. This will save your sanity and self-esteem.

4. Ask for a date sooner rather than later. It's a DATING app, not a CHATTING app. The goal of chatting is to figure out of you two are compatible enough for a first date. That's it. The ""getting to know each other"" part should be done in person. When you chat for too long, you create an imaginary and perfect person in your head, and then reality always disappoints. I find that asking for a date on day 2 or 3 works best for me. After you have a date scheduled, keep chatting to a minimum. The excitement of discovery should be left for the date itself. 

5. Don't lie about anything. Don't lie about your age, height, status, education, number of kids, etc. Use current photos that show you clearly, your face and your body. Don't hide anything, or you'll just be shooting yourself in the foot. Lying is an instant deal breaker for most people. You want to filter out anyone that's not attracted to you, *as you are right now*, and you want to do that before the first date. 

Good luck.",I am a girl and I think these are great advice.

I miss intimacy so much, making out, cuddling while watching a movie etc.

My country has a very strong kissing culture, kisses are not a big deal and they don't necessarily lead to anything else. So I feel like I'm missing out on so much by being alone. I just would really love the touch of another person right now.

Any of this sound familiar or am I just bad at dating?","We're seeing the endgame of decades of social media and dating apps.

""Connections"", if you can even call them that at first, are superficial at best. Maybe we find that one person who's very compatible in one area, like sex or finances, but they're a terrible fit for everything else.

Everything moves so fast and with the idea that we can dip out and trade up at any time, nobody bothers to work through issues anymore, much less taking the time to properly vet people. Sayings like, ""they're not yours, it's just your turn"" are a terrible way to look at a relationship but it's true nowadays.

I know a lot of people out there still want stable long-term relationships. But you can only get put through the ringer so many times before it changes you for the worse.

It's hard not to get discouraged after the umpteenth time your gut tells you this isn't your person. You start thinking you made too many bad decisions and wasted too much time.

She replied with something like ""omg DONT, men need to make the first move or it will come across that ur easy or crazy"".

Later on during our 'date' (we went for a walk to the beach), we sat beside each other and talked. he turned around to point out something behind us and I just went for it. A big ol' smooch on the cheek. He turned and looked at me and I kissed him again, on the lips.

You'd think, except she was using it as justification for why I was wrong for refusing to have sex.  She wouldn't let me put on a condom, and I (gently, tactfully) told her I didn't want to have sex without one.  So she said the above, not because she wanted to decide whether or not have sex, but claiming that I was obligated to have unprotected sex with her.  Her logic was because she was the one getting penetrated I had no say in this.  (Spoiler: we did not have sex.)

Being told (in my case) that you‚Äôre sooo special and amazing and he wants you forever, princess, here is a bunch of expensive shit you never asked for. Hearts all over the fucking whatsapp conversation. When you meet in real life he says ‚ÄúI hope you never left me, honey, I am so scar-red to lose you!‚Äù 


You‚Äôre overwhelmed and exhausted cause dating sucks, and you learn to accept the compliments and special treatment which never feel entirely earned and always slightly uncomfortable...


Then he fucking drops you. The interest dwindles fast and the plunge is fucking painful. Why? Who knows! Maybe he got bored. Back together with an ex. Found a better object of obsession? He suddenly stops texting you. Whereas before, he sent you pictures of everything he did from waking up to being on the job, riddled with hearts of course, he now sends you a dry ass text at 3 pm. ‚ÄúGoodmorning.‚Äù


When you were together before, he hugged you all night long in a way that you‚Äôve never been hugged before. Insisted on holding onto you to the point of annoyance. And you felt special. Maybe you felt guilty, for not feeling as strongly about the union as he seemed to, but bit by bit his love attacks won you over. 


At that point you are trying to answer the affection and meet his intensity,  and you reply with hearts and questions, and an ‚ÄúI miss you in my bed,‚Äù in a way that would normally seem juvenile and stupid. You feel butterflies,  because how could you not, when he directs entire flocks of them into your face all day long. 


You  hear nothing back from him! You wait, and you wait, and you wait. He‚Äôs online on Whatsapp but he never bothered to read your message There you sit with your dumbass hearts and, ‚ÄúI miss you,‚Äù and you feel duped. It gets worse. He quickly makes it obvious that he‚Äôs no longer interested in you. This is ‚Äòt done in an active, straightforward way. Nope, you get **faded.** It feels like mild disgust. You are a nuisance now, in the way of whomever comes next. You are irrelevant at best. 


And you wonder what the fuck you did wrong. Why did he stop liking you? Why did he even like you in the first place? You realize that he never even asked you about your life, your opinion on things, your family or your hobbies. And then you feel really fucking stupid. Because you were just an object of obsession. All of those petty promises he made of a simple life with a guaranteed retirement from loneliness, are nothing more than fairy dust. And you‚Äôre left with nothing. 


Please think carefully before you shower someone with affection. Don‚Äôt make promises that you can‚Äôt keep. Don‚Äôt flee into another person, please, because it hurts to be made into nothing more than an abandoned asylum for the hopelessly alone... You may not realize it, but you are hurting someone...

dating,pbe1rg,2021-08-25 15:52:12,General list of red flags in women.,"
As requested by u/throoowwitalllawaaay

I made a general list of red flags in women. Every situation is different.  Not every red flag necessarily means the relationship is doomed, sometimes you need to just work around it. **This isn't an all inclusive list, and can usually work for both genders, but I was requested to make one specifically for women**. 

**If she isn't responding/engaging in conversation** - She's most likely not interested, and if she is, is it really *worth* it? If a girl wants to talk to you, she WILL. Nobody waits days to answer someone they're genuinely interested in. 

**If she's obsessed with you** - This might seem great at first, but can turn south quick. Codependency is not healthy, and can create a foundation for control, manipulation, and abuse later on.  It's better to have a life outside of your relationship, rather than let your life revolve around it. 

**Always expects you to pay/bad with money** - This might not be an issue right away, but can come back to bite you in the ass in the long run. How can you build a future if your partner can't stop spending? How do you feel about being the breadwinner? Why should it be *your* responsibility to pay for everything? 

**My exes are psycho** - This one take with a grain of salt, because sometimes people legitimately just have bad luck dating and reading people. But in a lot of situations there's one common denominator and a reason their relationships ended badly. So stay on your toes. 

**She slaps/hits you if she's upset** - Physical violence is NEVER okay in a relationship, man or woman. If your date/SO hurts you in some way, run. If they do it once, it's likely it will happen again, and could be *much* worse. Not to be confused with play fighting or BDSM in the bedroom, which if consented to by both parties, is okay. 

**She makes her mental health your problem** - A lot of people legitimately have mental health issues, but it is not okay to make them someone else's responsibility. You shouldn't have to tiptoe around them all of the time. If they can't handle their emotions on a day to day basis, they have no business being in a relationship. If they ever ever ever say ""if you leave me, I'll kill myself"", run like the wind. Contact police, family, whoever you need to, to get them the help they need. But that's the end of your responsibility. That is nothing but an abuse/control tactic and is never okay. 

**Showers you with gifts and affection, but uses it against you** - This one is tricky. Have you ever heard of ""love-bombing""? Basically, someone will shower you with affection, but use it against you later. ""I did XYZ for you, and you can't appreciate it?"" You didn't ask for it, you don't owe them anything. It's manipulation. 

**Makes fun of you for humor** - She'll joke about your flaws or make rude comments, but say ""babe it was just a joke"". There's always some truth behind every one, and a lot of people will use humor as an excuse to make fun of you/complain about you. If it hurts your feelings, it was probably meant to even though she said it wasn't. Don't encourage those mind games. If it's a one off situation it might be an honest mistake, but if it's reoccurring, run. 

**She's always picking a fight** - As much as people like to say ""relationships are work"", they shouldn't be like this. Relationships really should be a source of stress relief. If everything you do is a problem to her, you need to find someone where it isn't. You shouldn't have to fight for a relationship, it should come naturally. 

**She doesn't say what she means** - This is a big issue I hear talked about a lot. ""Women never say what they mean"". That just means she has poor communication skills and expects you to just read her mind. Nobody is a mind reader, and relationships don't work without communication. I *promise* you that the women out there who are worth it, *will* tell you exactly what they want. How are you supposed to know unless she tells you? That's not fair to you.

**She plays the poor me act** - Some people are truly down on their luck. But for some they use it as a tool to manipulate you. They just need some help back on their feet, but never seem to actually get back on their feet. They're usually just using you as a meal ticket. 

**She only talks about her ex** - Sometimes this is unavoidable if they've spent years of their life with an ex. However, this is often a sign they are not over them or might be comparing you to them. You shouldn't have to compete for your partner. 

**She isn't consistent** - If some days she's super interested, and other days she's not. She might be working, might have other commitments, but watch for patterns. If she's hot and cold all of the time, you might not be the only one on her radar. If she does have other commitments, are you okay with working around those?

**She has cheated, or indicates she's cheated in the past** - If your partner has cheated, there's a very good chance they may do it again. A lot of cheaters just become sneakier once caught, and will tell you whatever you want to hear to not lose you. You can never erase that memory from the relationship. If she's cheated in the past, what were the circumstances? Use your best judgement, people do grow and change, but some never will. If she cheated on someone *with* you, use caution. 

You might be thinking, well how do I find a woman that doesn't have any of these red flags? If it were easy, everyone would be in great relationships. But it's not.  Sometimes you need to sift through *hundreds* of women before you find her. It is not worth dating someone who doesn't give you the love and affection you deserve. Again, this list does not include *all* red flags, but just some major ones I see come up a lot. 

I can't link anything here, but look of different types of emotional abuse tactics. 
Read them, get familiar with them, and save yourself some hurt in the future. 

Remember, you never are obligated to stay in a relationship. Their life is NOT your responsibility. Take care of yourself first. And communicate, communicate, communicate.

Edit: this is getting a lot of traction and I was asked many times to make a list for red flags in men as well. I will get that done in the next day or so! Again, these lists work for any gender or sexuality, but sometimes reading it for your sexual orientation helps people comprehend and understand them better.

I love spending time with him and he makes me happy overall. He checks all of the boxes with the exception of one‚Ä¶I cannot stand his dick. It doesn‚Äôt look visually appealing. It‚Äôs a shape that‚Äôs I‚Äôve never seen before. The head is larger than the base which makes giving oral surprisingly hard. It‚Äôs a bit smaller than I‚Äôm used to and I‚Äôve never been satisfied whenever we‚Äôve had sex. It bothers me a lot but I feel like it‚Äôs a little shallow.

Any advice here?

Edit: To answer a few questions. 
About what it looks like‚Ä¶it‚Äôs like a mushroom. The head is drastically larger than the base. The base is skinny and it‚Äôs short.

The overall experience is not satisfactory. There‚Äôs no foreplay, he doesn‚Äôt give oral, he wants me on top most of the time. He doesn‚Äôt seem to care if I orgasm. The stroke is bad. Kissing isn‚Äôt great. It‚Äôs just all bad.

My intention isn‚Äôt to make him feel bad or hurt his feelings as I do care about him so I would never tell him that it‚Äôs ugly/undesirable but thanks for the advice. I will talk to him next time we hang out and see if we can navigate the lack of sexual chemistry.","If you end it, definitely don't say that's the reason lol.

dating,lxmibl,2021-03-04 15:05:06,Sticking to your standards,"I (21F) have had an on and off situationship with this guy (20M) since this past summer. He has a pattern of pulling away when things get too close and then coming back a few weeks later. A few weeks ago he said he wasn‚Äôt looking for a relationship, I told him I was, and then we stopped talking. Then, like clockwork, a week or so later he reaches out to hang out. 

I told him again that we are looking for different things, and he says we should talk over FaceTime. So we talk, and I tell him (again) that I am looking for a deeper connection as well as exclusivity. He says he wants a deep connection with me but can‚Äôt be exclusive. He then asks if we can still talk, I say no, emotionally it would be too difficult for me. That was that, and we agreed to go our separate ways.

I know it seems minuscule, but I‚Äôm really proud of myself for sticking to my standards. Too many times I have bent my standards to fit what a romantic interest wanted and I always got hurt in the end. No more of that. I want an actual loving relationship, and I won‚Äôt settle for crumbs. Yes, it hurts because I really liked him, but it‚Äôs better than dragging it out for months.","Translation of:

dating,j8szj9,2020-10-10 21:44:59,"I, a black 25 y/o F, find it cringy when guys use racial injustice as a way to win me over","I‚Äôm a black female who mostly dates white and Asian guys. I‚Äôve met a lot of great guys along the way and have had some amazing relationships, but I‚Äôm newly single and have decided to get back out there mostly via dating apps. Something I‚Äôve noticed is that a lot of guys try to win me over with ‚Äúwokeness‚Äù by talking about all the protests they‚Äôve attended or how much they‚Äôve donated to BLM. While I do think it‚Äôs important for potential partners to be aware of these issues, I don‚Äôt want that to be the main way they try to win me over. I also don‚Äôt want to constantly be reminded of racism when all I‚Äôm trying to do is have a good time and get to know someone. 

So my advice to anyone who‚Äôs trying to date a black woman (or man) is to know when it is appropriate to have that conversation. The first date over drinks and appetizers probably isn‚Äôt the best time, but those topics will come up naturally as time goes on and we get to know each other better. Also there are better more subtle ways to approach the topic rather than trying to prove how woke and progressive you are.","This! I'm a Black woman in your very shoes. I cringe when a guy's Bio only says ""BLM"" (I've seen this a few times) or when all their pics are all regarding their BLM protest attendance or the first thing they want to talk to me about is social justice. Also feel the same way for when it's about feminism so not limited to just BLM related subjects."
dating,j7cc4h,2020-10-08 12:43:08,Please stay off Tinder if you're seeing someone already,"I (26M) matched with a girl (26F) on Tinder 2 weeks ago. Her bio said she's looking for a serious relationship. We've been chatting and flirting over the phone till tonight. We were going to have a drink at her house. When I was outside her house, she sent me a message saying that she actually has a boyfriend and her housemate advised her not to go through with it.  


I'm glad that she came clean before I even met her in person, but I'm so disappointed in her.  


So if you're seeing someone already, please stay off dating apps for the sake of the person you're seeing and/or the people on those apps.



EDITED: She has a boyfriend, not just seeing a guy.",Damn she waited until you were at her house to blow you off?
dating,vm63gj,2022-06-27 21:40:52,I just want to thank all the girls/women who take things into their own hands and make the first move and make it super obvious,"I'm 28 year old guy and I've always been the one who had to make the fist step and it really never went anywhere. 

Few days earlier I went on a date with a girl who I've met in person just three times before. At first encounter she was friendly and energetic. When we met for the second time (with bunch of other friends) she was frolicking around, poking me and making dirty jokes here and there. I didn't get any of that... Then we exchanged few messages, she asked about my new work (retail) and if she could come by, I said sure, why not. We chatted until the closing hours and when I got home I got message from her if I wanted to go to the movies, zoo or literally whatever with her. And then it finally clicked. This never happened to me before so I was a little bit stupefied but I gladly accepted. We went to the cinema and then spent hours just walking around the city, chatting and laughing. When we parted ways I sent her message jokingly asking about how are we going to call this. She replied ""how about we call it a date?"" which was exactly what I wanted to hear. And we agreed on another date. We will see where it goes but it's really refreshing that we can be just so straightforward about it. 

So ladies, if you are interested in a guy, please be as subtle as a snowman in the summer, we really appreciate it. Even strong hints often go completely over our heads.",That was a nice read and I think your story will help some people. Hope things go well between you and the girl.
dating,hqxgt8,2020-07-14 08:01:34,It is seriously like quite common to never have had sex. Even in your thirties. Even for medical students. I almost killed myself multiple times over that shit. So stupid,"We seriously need to do a MUCH better job of normalizing people that have never had sex. Because it is starting to become clear to me that it IS very much NORMAL. A LOT of people are just scared to admit that they‚Äôre still a virgin. It‚Äôs not exactly something people like to mention first thing when they meet someone. Or ever for that matter.

Edit: And people downvoting this can fuck right off. Killing your narrative, eh? Cause that‚Äôs what it is. And I could be dead right now because of it. I came pretty damn close

Edit 2:

https://imgur.com/a/7yFDOpn

Some polls I did on reddit mostly on r/polls recently really opened up my eyes to the possibility that a lot of redditors really have not had sex yet regardless of age. There are multiple problems with these polls mostly related to how representative redditors in these subs are of the general population. Also, some polls are misleading if you don‚Äôt take into account differences in age and gender (these differences had to be taken separately). Still, the results were so pronounced that I could not help but be moved by them. I got decent or good sample sizes for most categories. Head‚Äôs up though: there are some weird effects there too (idk wtf is going on with the results from younger age groups). Honesty and/or confusion could be factoring in too I guess.

Uploading the charts image to imgur has been leading to some fuzziness. Sorry. If you open within the reddit app you can‚Äôt see anything. If you open in the imgur app it‚Äôs clear.

Edit 3: I get it‚Äôs problematic to try to say redditors represent the general population when they clearly don‚Äôt. I‚Äôm not saying they do. This was a survey of the participants at the subs I used. That‚Äôs it. Getting data on this subject is problematic and controversial anyway. Most of what we get fed is probably skewed the other way however because people in the general population are probably more reluctant to offer if they‚Äôre part of a stigmatized population unless it is 100% anonymous. And anonymous platforms tend to not be representative of the general population for one reason or another. I think it‚Äôs a problem. Collecting data from health records is pretty terrible too if you think of it. How often are people really telling the doctor or nurse the truth in these situations? Probably not very often. So, yes the real numbers are going to be way lower in the general population than my numbers. But maybe it was good to see things from a population skewed the other way than what we are used to. My experience with social pressure and isolation in these circumstances was ridiculous. I know this is a huge problem. I‚Äôve lived it.","Based on relatively recent data, only 14% of men aged 20-24 are virgins. Thats drops to less than 5% after 25. This doesnt mean being a virgin is a bad thing. Its just factually incorrect to say that its common.

I asked if he would ever like to get coffee or go for a walk. And he messaged saying he appreciated that I reached out to him, but he is not looking for anything other than friendship right now. He acknowledged how difficult it can be to send these messages and he thanked me for it.

I'm a little bummed out. He is really funny and smart, and I had kinda day dreamt about us being together. But at the same time, I'm glad I got some closure from this conversation.

dating,j0tbcd,2020-09-27 15:48:36,Unpopular opinion: I want to date a mentally healthy man,"Hear me out on this and yes I know mental health is a touchy subject in society now. For over a year I dated a man that had schizophrenia, BPD, depression, and some anxiety issues (not the fake I can‚Äôt respond to texts kind). I had known him for 10 plus years and it didn‚Äôt appear until his 30s. He‚Äôs currently taking 21 different meds. I‚Äôve broken up with him several times over emotional abuse and him damaging my apartment. Today we are friends and he understands that I will never be his wife nor the mother of his children. 

When I read on Reddit or other areas of the internet about a guy/girl feeling down on themselves because their ex couldn‚Äôt deal with their health issues and the whole forum puts the ex on blast is very conceited. Put yourself in the ex‚Äôs shoes. Imagine being so close to one person and you are madly in love with them. Overtime they increasingly becomes someone else. Then they think the CIA is after them and next minute they‚Äôre homeless. I had to be there for him. I had to leave work early to see him because he thought the CIA was knocking on his door. I‚Äôve had to spend money on clothes for him to take to the mental hospital because he was there for 3 weeks. Imagine picking your loved one up from a mental hospital and the first thing they say is they tried to kill me there and the government was there watching. At that point I knew my lover was gone. I knew he was never going to be the same. He is going to get worse.

So please let‚Äôs stop trashing exes of people suffering from mental illnesses. It‚Äôs mentally exhausting when someone you love is not mentally there. I know some people are great at supporting this, for some like myself I can‚Äôt. After growing up with 2 parents that could possibly be bipolar, I don‚Äôt want to continue the cycle. In a few months I will be back on the dating scene and quite frankly I will have several barriers up. I want a mentally stable man that doesn‚Äôt have a history of illness‚Äôs.

To the people that has issues, this is not putting you down. You didn‚Äôt ask for this. Understand that we aren‚Äôt individual that‚Äôs enough for you.","Therapist here; my ex had clinical depression and although we were together mostly while I was in school, I look back and wonder if there were some personality issues or maybe some bipolar diagnosis gone unchecked. 

Anyway, it was rough being with someone who frequently had severe depressive episodes that required monitoring. But apart from his mental health issues, he also took no initiative to do anything about it. Couldn‚Äôt really hold down a job, spent all his money on weed, and had grandiose ideas about changing the world with an idea of a novel he never wrote. He broke up with me a few times and would regret it and I would take him back after he implied suicide. It sucked.

The final time he broke up with me, I made a clean break.

That relationship really screwed with my self-esteem and ability to communicate in an intimate relationship.


Through my own work (that is ongoing), I fell into a new relationship with a man who does not have any mental health concerns. Things aren‚Äôt perfect but they‚Äôre wonderful. I can communicate my frustrations or hurt to my partner without it having end up with me consoling him because he‚Äôs hurt that he hurt me. None of that manipulative shit.

Point being, I‚Äôve seen individuals with mental illnesses in good relationships but they really have to be putting in the work. In intimate relationships we tend to ‚Äútry less‚Äù or put the burden of our own shortcomings and insecurities onto our partners. If you have a mental illness, you have to work twice as hard to keep that in check. 

I don‚Äôt fault you for what you want. Please do some work to ensure you don‚Äôt take your baggage into a mentally stable relationship and then perpetuate the cycle yourself. üíï"

We clicked instantly and can talk for hours without getting bored. We take almost every opportunity to hang out when we're free from work.

Last night, on a whim, I asked him on a stargazing date with me. To my surprise, he happily accepted. We went to a local park and spread out a blanket. We started out by finding shapes in the clouds, as it wasn't a clear night. We soon began talking about our families, goals, and everything under the sun.

At one point, I leaned my head on his shoulder and he leaned towards me and put his arm around me. He ran his fingers through my hair as we continued to talk and everything just felt so right. I'm not sure how, but we ended up holding hands with me in his arms under the stars.

dating,kxb23a,2021-01-14 18:06:49,On dating apps always post full length pictures of your entire body and not just your face,"I recently matched with a girl on Bumble who just had photos that were using filters and of her face. I have used dating apps for a while so I know what this usually means but she looked really slim in her pics. We talked over the app for a few days, exchanging pretty funny and nice chat. Then she said out of nowhere that she is a bigger gal and that guys tend to ghost her after she says this.

Me not wanting to be a dick said that it was probably in her head and that she was probably not that big. However she sent across a full body pic and she was very much overweight. I kindly said and was honest in saying that I didn't particularly fancy overweight girls, which she was absolutely fine with and said she was used to this happening. She promptly deleted her Bumble account stating that once she tells guys this, overweight girls like her always get nowhere. However she did this before I could give her the following piece of advice, which I presume would apply to both guys and girls on dating apps:

Regardless of your body shape always put full length body pics on dating app profiles. On the guys side of things when a girl's profile is just their face it's a flag that they're overweight and not comfortable with it. Even if larger, putting full body pics shows that you are more comfortable and confident in your own skin and are owning what you like. You might get less matches but those that you do match with will probably like what they see.

In this girl's case she got matches on the pretense she was slim when she absolutely wasn't, which is not honest and I basically see as form of catfishing. She would have gotten much further on dating apps if she had pictures of her whole body on initially and guys would know this from the off and not suddenly ghost her when she mentions it. Because in a sense they aren't being lied to anymore.

People on dating apps, be confident in yourself and honestly portray what you look like becuase there will always be someone out there who will like your looks.","By the same token, if you‚Äôre a guy, don‚Äôt wear a hat in every fuckin photo. If you‚Äôre balding, I want to know."

dating,pm697d,2021-09-11 12:06:39,"Men‚Äôs advice. Women are either attracted to you, or they aren‚Äôt. The concept of ‚Äòleagues‚Äô is nothing more than a self-limiting mindset that leads to failure.","
When a guy who isn‚Äôt traditionally good looking is seen with a beautiful woman, the initial thought is that she is out of his ‚Äòleague‚Äô, which is a ludicrous statement when you think about it.

If someone is with another person, they are obviously ‚Äòin their league‚Äô because they have made the choice to be with them.

There isn‚Äôt a glass ceiling when it comes to attraction, where women are only reserved for guys with certain good looks, money, or status. One should never interact with a beautiful woman with the belief that he is lucky to be dating her, having sex with her, or even being in her presence.

You have to view yourself as someone she is equally lucky to be around. Whether it‚Äôs your intelligence, skill, charm, unique insight, your drive, your humor, etc.‚Äîyou have to always focus on what makes you a prize. She may be beautiful, but ask yourself, what else can she offer as a person as well? You will always have something you can offer to enhance someone, but you have to believe it authentically and project it in how you act.

No matter what you do, there will always be a significant number of women aren‚Äôt attracted to you. It‚Äôs true for both men and women alike. But never view this as a level based system where you can‚Äôt achieve a certain height. This limiting belief will almost always lead to insecurity, neediness, and ultimately failure.

Develop yourself, work on your social skills, take care of your body and appearance, and the odds will fall more in your favor.","I remember seeing a study once, on reddit, that tried to tackle this concept. Now, I can't find the study, so you'll have to rely on my memory and I can't confirm how big/valid/repeatable the study was, but this is what I can remember: They asked people to rate themselves 1-10 (personal rating) and then rate other participants 1-10. Each person then was assigned a public rating that was the average of the ratings they got from others. Then they created a social situation where people would naturally end up pairing up. What they found was that people didn't necessarily match up with others who had the same public rating, but rather a similar personal rating. People who thought they were a 7 paired up with others who had a personal rating of 6-8. Even if their public rating was a 4, they still would be pair up with an 8. People who got a public rating of 10 but felt like a 6 could easily end up with someone who had a personal rating of 5 and a public rating of 4. 

Essentially, it showed that leagues are not set by public perception, but by the individuals' perception of themselves. I try to keep this in mind when I'm dating.  Now I know if someone likes me, they must hate themselves too."
dating,i6d32h,2020-08-09 04:06:13,"Stop shaming people who suffer from depression, attachment issues or mental trauma that they do not deserve love, intimacy and companionship.","I see this garbage posted a lot and it's just not fucking true at all. You don't have to ""improve"" yourself just to get a freaking date with someone, you don't need to go on a several year long emotional odyssey of self-reflection where you reach into the deepest core of your inner being and try to discover who you really are.

As well intentioned as it might be, your average person does not go through this deep epiphany that they need to change everything about their lives and themselves, who the fuck actually does this? Your average dick and jane do not do this, they don't go through these deeply intricate character arcs that reddit and the internet expects you to go through. They meet during hs, they meet in college, they meet through sheer coincidence via friend of a friend, these people did not have to go through the sheer number of hoops that reddit tells you to jump through. Stop telling people that they need to change every fiber of their being just to be worthy of someone maybe liking them back.

You can be depressed, you can have thoughts of self-loathing, but you can still love someone else. ""You have to love yourself before you can love anyone else"" is complete and utter garbage. The most depressed people around give their everything to help others find joy, even if they don't show it.

What do you people want? Stop with the empty platitudes and telling people to go seek therapy. Do you know how fucking expensive therapy is and how completely inaccessible it is? Do you not know that there is pandemic and a recession where 20 million renters are on the brink of eviction?

I love it when people shame others for being lonely and venting about things are kind of shitty right now and it would be great to date or be with someone to support you through whatever is going on. Acting like we need to just leave everyone else alone, deal with everything ourselves and until we get everything ""fixed"" in our lives, we can't ever dare to desire physical and emotional intimacy with another person.

I know reddit loves the bootstraps mentality where you just do everything on your own and figure everything out on your own and pretend that, indeed, you did do it all on your own, when it's more likely they have partners and a support network of friends and family.

I love being told to just learn to be happy on your own or how being single is actually this great thing, but then you tell them to prove it by breaking up and go back to being single, they'd be crying within weeks that they can't do this and that they have needs. When you're told to just be alone and deal with everything on your own, but then they'll post here or elsewhere that they wouldn't have made this far without their wife/gf or husband/bf. It's beyond hypocritical.

tl;dr I'm tired of the hypocrisy. You don't need to become fit and buff, you don't need to become a renaissance man with 8 billion different hobbies, you don't need to go out and make friends with 8 billion people who likely don't really care about you that much, you don't need to go reach into the deepest recesses of your soul and change your entire personality and become a different person.

You are valid and ""worthy"" enough as it is. If you want to make changes to your life or personality, that's great. But you don't need to reach a certain plateau just to find a date or get a girlfriend. There are countless people in the world that are generally awful and they have no problems dating or starting relationships.

Edit: I really appreciate the kind words and sincere replies from a lot of people that understood what I was trying to say, along with the few that expressed an open mind in maybe changing up their advice and trying to be more empathetic.

Definitely some that proved my point that reddit loves the bootstraps mentality and you should just suffer alone until you magically fix yourself; stay mad.","""No one will love you before you love yourself"" is a really fucking bad way of articulating ""if you don't see your own value you're more likely to allow other people to mistreat you, so be extra careful when entering relationships if you're struggling with low self worth."""

We talked for a bit more, then said he had to take a call. He fucking left and blocked me!! We were having a nice time (I thought) and he left! I fucking hate dating 

EDIT: Thank you for the mostly supportive comments, guys! It really means a lot to me. For the other comments, all I have to say is I really thought we had a connection, and I trusted that his intentions were pure. I like to believe the best in people, because if I keep a negative mindset, then I will always be miserable and never happy. It sometimes gets me in situations like this, but hey...at least now I know I dodged a bullet and that we wouldn't have worked out in the end.","Honest advice here. If you wanted to blow him, just go for it. But PLEASE never do it just to please him so he can stay. I just can't help but feel like this is what happened here.

You are going to find a lot of great people but first, you need to change the way you deal with things!

dating,uhbee3,2022-05-03 08:22:56,Went for a first kiss,"Yesterday I had a 2nd date with this girl, at the end we were waiting for my train so we went near the end of the platform where there was barely anyone around. Now, I had decided prior I'm gonna try kissing her at some point during the date but wasn't sure about the approach. I leaned on the railing and she was standing in front, facing me. I thought to myself fk it and just gently pulled her towards me for a cuddle, I didn't even think about kissing her at that moment. Our faces were close, then our eyes met and boom it just clicked. We both went for it without a word, kinda mid-word actually, it honestly felt like we pulled each other like a magnet. It felt quite special. 

Just wanted to share my thoughts with someone.",Yay you!!

dating,ggw0y0,2020-05-10 06:02:30,I finally kissed him,"I met this guy (22) during the winter at my (22f) part-time job that I've worked at over breaks ever since I was 16. I come back when I'm home from college. We started hanging out more and I told him I liked him, which he replied that he did too. We went on 2 dates, but we are both really shy, so we just held hands. Today after work, my best friend (who works at the same part-time job as me) made a small graduation celebration today at the park since I graduated via email at 10am this morning haha. After eating and playing games, we went our separate ways except for the guy and me. We stood outside in the cold for what must have been 20 or 30 minutes just making stupid jokes. He made sure my car started since it wouldn't start when I left work before. He stood at my door and I made a small stupid joke about me being short. Then I said ""if I weren't so short I would try to kiss you."" Then he kissed me.

I've gone on dates before, but have never liked a guy the way I like this one. I was never the one who tried to kiss first since I'm so shy, but I could tell we both wanted to and he's too polite to make sudden moves which is another thing I really like about him. The guys I've dated before were huge jerks and did not respect my boundaries like he does. I've wanted to kiss him for a while and it finally happened.

dating,vl3kkp,2022-06-26 12:22:16,I (27m) met a girl (29f) who is perfect for me on paper. But she‚Äôs saving sex for marriage. Advice?,"I‚Äôve never liked anybody this much. We have so much fun together and get along so well. We‚Äôve been dating for a few months now and I am seriously falling for this girl. The only thing is is she‚Äôs saving herself for marriage and the only form of release I get is jerking off onto her stomach. She won‚Äôt give me oral but is fine with receiving it. I totally respect her wishes in her decisions but it‚Äôs leaving me feeling sexually unsatisfied. I told her about my feelings yesterday and now she‚Äôs kind of giving me the cold shoulder. What do I do?

Edit: she‚Äôs had sex before and is no stranger to it. She had her party girl days and recently became Christian which influenced her decision to do this.

Edit 2: wow this blew up. I thought I should add that I just had a talk with her. She says that she doesn‚Äôt want to give oral because she‚Äôs worried about how long that will satisfy me. And if she does give me oral and it won‚Äôt keep me satisfied for very long. She said she really wants to actually. But is scared it won‚Äôt keep me satisfied for very long.

I also brought up the fact that I am not religious with her and she says that she ‚Äúhas hope that anyone can become religious and eventually believe what she believes.‚Äù 

I keep trying to tell her how this isn‚Äôt gonna work with me or with anyone who doesn‚Äôt share her beliefs in the future. And she keeps circling back to how she really wants to give me oral and how there‚Äôs more to relationship than just sex. Also, she says that she doesn‚Äôt believe the Bible says anything about foreplay. That everything besides penetration is on the table. That her belief is her own.

Edit 3: this is my final edit. Thank you to everyone who responded. This was incredibly difficult to do and after many tears I broke it off with her today. While part of me wishes that I did save myself for her, another part of me knows that I wouldn‚Äôt have been satisfied the whole time. Also I know that I‚Äôm not gonna convert to Christianity anytime soon. Sorry that I won‚Äôt be able to respond to everyone but it was a resounding ‚ÄúRed flag‚Äù.

dating,kznr54,2021-01-18 05:07:34,Does anyone else feel the need to be friends before dating?,"I (M) feel the need to be familiar with someone and have built some comfort with them before dating them. I can notice a woman and have her in mind as a potential romantic/sexual partner but going from stranger/acquaintance to dating feels too fast. Part of dating is about getting to know the other person but I need to know and like them a bit before that. I also feel like there's an expectation of sexual/physical contact in the first few dates and doing that with what was recently an acquaintance weirds me out.

&#x200B;

Once I'm familiar and comfortable with someone, I can initiate sex several times a day but in the first few dates, I don't even feel like kissing someone unless we've known each other enough to be friends. It feels like skipping steps. There have been times women have hit on me or asked me out and it went over my head at the time because we hadn't talked or had only had a 5 minute conversation.

&#x200B;

Anyone like that?",I‚Äôm like that as well. Both my exes we were friends for a period before dating.  I could never go from a stranger to dating without that period of friendship first - especially because I don‚Äôt enjoy sex if it‚Äôs not with someone that I know on a deep level.

Edit: didn‚Äôt think this would blow up but thanks so much! I hope it encourages some of you to take a chance :)

Tonight I was in a fast food drive thru and made eye contact with the guy two cars behind me (the drive thru was curved I wasn‚Äôt hanging out the window lol). I thought he was cute so when I got to the window I wrote my name and number on a napkin and asked the girl at the window to give it to him (and to ask if he was single first). 

About 15 minutes later he texted me. We chatted a little he added me on social and I realized he was quite a bit younger than me (nothing illegal). It‚Äôs not gonna work out, but he said it made him smile and I‚Äôm sure the employees at the restaurant got a good laugh out of it/had something to talk about, and tbh made me feel super confident. 

It was worth a shot and I‚Äôm glad I did it. IT WAS EXHILARATING. And at least I made a few people laugh, including myself. 

SHOOT YOUR SHOT. At the very least it‚Äôll make someone feel good about themselves and there‚Äôs nothing wrong with that.","Damn, that‚Äôs some impressive initiative. He‚Äôll probably remember that for a long time."

The main one (for me) is the prep that it takes for a woman to get ready for a date. I'm a very low-maintenance kind of girl in everyday life, however; when I have a date, I want to put in extra effort and that means doing extra things like putting on makeup, straightening my hair (which takes at least an hour), maybe doing a face/hair mask etc...also, my leg hair grows crazy fast so I always want to shave before hand, any italian girls out there? (if i don't have time to and the guy wants to get...""intimate"", I'll say I want to keep my clothes on. If only he made the plan earlier, I would be more likely to let him touch my legs :P). Also...need time to pick out a good outfit. What if all my good clothes are dirty? What if my good underwear are dirty? I want to be able to plan ahead and know what I'm wearing!!! This is my biggest qualm with last minute plans, but moreover, it makes me think you're not that interested in dating me or dating anyone for that matter. If you really care about going out with a girl. make the plan a couple days in advance and actually pick a time, not just ""I'll call you tomorrow and we'll figure it out"", ideally it would be ""I will pick you up at X time"" or ""I'll meet you at X place place at x time"".

I ended up doing 100% of the courting and it was stressful and exhausting. I never felt good enough and I never felt like I was dating them because I was the one asking them on dates, paying, driving, buying gifts, everything. 

Don‚Äôt let this happen to you. I get that most women have a pretty much limitless supply of men who will do all these things for th, so we as men are kinda replaceable to them.

A lot of people on all dating/relationship subs post every single day, that ‚Äúomg i‚Äôm never gonna have a GF/BF. I‚Äôve never had one, never will. Life is so depressing. What to do?‚Äù

Ok let me stop you there. You‚Äôre not ready for a relationship, if it‚Äôs to fill a void, so you don‚Äôt feel depressed... whatever the cause is. Depressed because you‚Äôre lonely, poor, bad looking, whatever. 

You feel depressed because there‚Äôs something very specific, that‚Äôs bothering you. You‚Äôre insecure about something, and have low self esteem because of it.

You‚Äôve probably heard about people on different subs saying ‚Äúyou need to work on yourself‚Äù when given advice. That‚Äôs absolutely correct!

I personally had a porn addiction i got rid of a year ago (shoutout to r/NoFap). That made me a whole new person. I was good at dating before, but it‚Äôs a whole new World now. I‚Äôm not scared if i get rejected, idk if i didn‚Äôt get to 2nd date with the cute girl, because i‚Äôm good without it.

I‚Äôm good without a GF, because i‚Äôm happy with who i am and proud to be me. Every single day.

Whatever it is that‚Äôs bothering you, you gotta find the core of the problem, the main reason you *don‚Äôt* have a self esteem, that‚Äôs on top of its game.

Hey, what‚Äôs funny? I‚Äôve a GF now.

Why? How you may ask.

*i didn‚Äôt need one*

HOWEVER....there is also NOTHING wrong with being lonely and being frustrated about it. I know myself VERY well and while I don‚Äôt ‚Äúneed‚Äù to be in a relationship, I absolutely 100% PREFER IT. That‚Äôs not to say I‚Äôll take whatever dip shit comes my way because of desperation, but there is nothing wrong is actively seeking out a quality relationship and being completely bummed out when it seems like you‚Äôll never find your person.

dating,oeb742,2021-07-05 16:44:26,The lack of effort and respect in today's dating is frustrating,"I put effort into dating and it has not been reciprocated at all so far. I try to be respectful, mannered and generally ladylike. Are these not important values in today's dating world? I've noticed a trend of men being extremely lazy in dating and I am very frustrated by it. For example, for the past few dates I've been on, I took an hour and a half to get ready not to mention how much money I spent on grooming to ensure I made a good impression. The guys showed up in some version of a stained tshirt, baseball cap and old gym shorts. It was infuriating to consider how much time and money I spent to look nice meanwhile they couldn't even be bothered to put on clean clothes. Like, I'm not asking for them to come dressed in a 3 piece suit. Simply something clean and put together that shows thought and effort.

I'm not asking for them to take me to some thousand dollar restaurant but when someone suggests McDonald's because they get paid Friday and they don't want to spend more than 5 dollars on a girl they don't know in case it's a waste, I see that as disrespect. Some highlights of dates I've been on include someone going to the bathroom and staying there for 30 min right when the check came out, someone else requesting I drive an hour each way to pick them up and drop them off because they were planning to drink themselves into a stupor during the date, another ordering 3 entrees and a take home when they learned I would be paying for the date, yet another one trying  to gauge the possibility of having sex as an icebreaker and another one demanding I pay for the first five dates we go on as proof that I'm not a gold digger. To me, this is simply laziness and disrespect.

My ex and I broke up because he wasn't putting in any effort into the relationship. I am quickly finding out that the guys out there aren't that much different. I match with someone on a dating app and even though I'm not extroverted, I try my best to hold up a conversation over text and be lively only to be hit with one word responses or sexual innuendos back.

The unwillingness to make a good impression to a complete stranger and the total lack of respect is infuriating.","You also have those people who will try to make a good impression up until you become *emotionally invested* in them. Once that happens they reveal their ""authentic selves""!

The sooner you know what you're dealing with the less time you waste  overall.

dating,gl9lu1,2020-05-17 05:00:32,I've started calling out guys who ghost me and I've never felt better,"It started when I went on a date with a guy from my gym. He was really attractive, honestly I thought he was a little out of my league. Or maybe he didn't think it was a date (we did meet on Hinge though) but he invited me to meet up at the gym again later via text, and when I pitched dinner or drinks instead, he went silent. Honestly, I'm so sick of that shit. We had friendly interactions and worse, we were likely to see each other again at the gym - not so with Covid but I didn't know that at the time.

In the past I'd've seen this guy around the gym after being ghosted and I would have been embarrassed and felt ashamed, but this time something shifted in me. He's the one who should be embarrassed! How hard is it to say no thank you!So, the next day I politely did it for him. I said something along the lines of:""I'll take the silence to mean you'd rather just be buds. Totally understand.""

By phrasing it out for him it made it easier, so he responded with a confirmation ""yes, just down to climb as friends"" and an apology for not answering sooner. But I didn't leave it there, I added ""Hey, I get it, rejecting people sucks. but on the receiving end it feels better when you use your words, and it makes it less awkward when we see each other around the gym."" He apologized again, and I made it clear we were cool, and it seemed like he left that conversation happier than just ghosting me and I left it happier too feeling like I got a respectful answer and I could see that he didn't actually have such disdain for my invitation or think I'm repulsive etc. And maybe I didn't owe him the kindness, but it felt good to think that with that conversation, maybe he won't ghost girls in the future. Maybe he'll remember what I pointed out, that it's so much more hurtful to have someone you had a nice time with just go silent as opposed to kindly expressing that they're not interested.

Anyway, it's happening again, with a casual hookup this time, and I intend to voice my feelings again. I'm not going to let these guys ignore the fact that I am a person who should be treated with respect. If you date someone or sleep with them, you owe them the respect of a polite response instead of the silent treatment. You don't even have to give a reason, but that dread of sitting around, waiting for an answer, slowly realizing they aren't into you and don't even respect you enough to say so - I'm not taking it anymore. I don't think I've dated assholes, just cowards, and when offered an out they'd probably rather take that out than just go ghost.

So I'm going to be polite and understanding, but I'm going to let people know that it's hurtful and that they should be better. And maybe it'll be a little ripple effect of positivity on the dating scene in my city. And instead of just feeling bad I suggest other people try it too - it feels kind of powerful honestly.

Edit/Update: Despite a lot of people not liking this advice, I had another really positive interaction. I just let him know that I hoped if he didn‚Äôt want to hook up again he‚Äôd say so and not ghost, which gave him an opportunity to say that he doesn‚Äôt and for me to say that I understand, the worlds crazy right now etc. He answered after that and was genuinely kind and I feel like we closed out on much better terms than if I‚Äôd just ‚Äúlet it be‚Äù or accepted that I‚Äôm not owed anything and that‚Äôs how it is. Now he doesn‚Äôt feel guilty and I am not sitting around, checking my phone, wondering if I‚Äôm being ghosted, etc. That dread of not knowing sucks and now we ended on good terms and I don‚Äôt have to sit through it. Maybe my approach isn't for everyone but I think it was good for me and my ex-hookup in this case.",I like the way you worded it too. Honestly good for you because I think it‚Äôs important for people to realize their actions have consequences for other people and not just themselves. The wording really gets it across without being antagonistic.

dating,oqsddo,2021-07-24 15:38:23,"The woman I was seeing said I made her feel safe and appreciated, left me for her abusive ex","So I(27M) had been seeing a woman(24F) for a few weeks. She came on to me, which in my experience was a first. We went on numerous dates, but never had the chance to be fully alone because of our living situations. She would constantly say how I treated her better than her ex, how I supported her emotionally and didn't try to manipulate her. We connected very quickly sharing deep insights about ourselves, she said she felt safe with me. As things go on she became more stand-offish and saying it's not going to work, she doesn't want ""commitment"" right now, she said she needed to work on herself and figure stuff out. I obliged her request and put things on hold, but still chatting with her, we would still hang out. She would constantly say how much she adored me and how much she cared about me. She went to a wrestling show and saw her ex there. They started talking and she messaged me this morning saying that she is going to work things out with him. That things will never work between me and her. I'm now just left here feeling worthless and alone, like she was just toying with me. She chose to go back to her ex which she said time and time again would tell at her, manipulate her, make her feel like shit. I'm just so frustrated and hurt by everything.

Edit: she just messaged me saying she's not following through with her ex. I'm going to take the advice I've been receiving and going no contact with her.","Two lessons to be learned here.

1. You cannot save people from themselves. If she‚Äôs looking to maintain the cycle of abuse in relationships in her life and that is how she has identified what love is supposed to look like then just showing up and being a nice guy to her is not going to break her out of it.

dating,vy4aul,2022-07-13 14:17:03,My little sister left my phone number for the cute waitress at a restaurant and somehow got me a date (?),"I took my sister to a restaurant I frequent the other day. She was feeling down so I thought I should treat her. While me and the waitress that usually takes my orders chatted away, she gave my sister some crayons and some papers to color on. Once we got our orders settled, my sister being autistic, interpreted me and the waitress chat as flirting. Granted, I did have a little crush on her, the waitress was pretty cute. But anyways, I tried to explain to her the lady was just doing her job. But she insisted that the she liked me and I should ask for her number. I gave her every reason in the book why that was considered rude, and could even make her uncomfortable. But she was insistent that the waitress liked me.

When it finally came down to leaving, my sister shoved one of her drawings into the bill booklet thing. I asked her what she drew for the waitress, but she said it was a secret. She was terrible at keeping it though because on the way home, she couldn‚Äôt stop snickering. When I managed to pry out what she thought was so funny, she admitted that she left my phone number in the bill with a picture of me and the waitress holding hands!

I was super embarrassed. I wasn‚Äôt exactly mad that she left my number since I‚Äôve thought of doing it a few times. But I still had to pretend to be upset so she doesn‚Äôt accidentally get us doxxed or something. I told her that that wasn‚Äôt cool, and she promised not to do it again. And for the next few hours, I resigned myself to never coming back to that restaurant. That is, until the waitress actually texted me! Long story short, I have a date coming up soon. Though, I don‚Äôt see it really going anywhere, it‚Äôs still pretty nice.

Edit: since people seem to keep asking why I don‚Äôt see it going anywhere, I meant that I don‚Äôt EXPECT it to go anywhere. For all intents and purposes, I‚Äôm a parent to my sister. And at 24, most women I meet (understandably) aren‚Äôt about that life. And though my sister is good at masking being autistic in public, she drops it around me. She‚Äôs an arm full, and I love her. But realistically I don‚Äôt see anyone making the effort to be with me long term. But, that doesn‚Äôt mean I can‚Äôt try to find someone. I just keep my expectations tapered (:

Edit 2: Went on the date. It went great! My sister tagged along and we went to the mall together and had some ice cream. After I put my sister to sleep, the night ended in us hooking up. It was a nice (: But, it doesn‚Äôt seem like she‚Äôs looking for anything long term. However, she was interested in still having a fwb relationship with me. Emphasis on the friends part. She got along so well with me and my sister. Heck, she could be a special Ed teacher with how chill she was. Emphasis on the benefits too heh. From now on, she‚Äôll be sneaking in more loaves of bread into my appetizers! As well as some other stuff lol. That‚Äôs more than I could ever ask for",Damn your sister came in clutch.  A true wingwoman.
dating,v4ig08,2022-06-04 05:56:13,Anyone else want a relationship but are happy single?,"As the title says, I have a single life I'm happy with, close with my family, great hobbies, good career, no friends(which I choose) generally I'm very happy single, but does anyone else feel like they want a relationship at the same time.

I guess what I'm saying is like 5 days out of the week I'm happy single, do my own thing and is all good. But then there are a few times a week where you just think 'huh, I'd love to have a partner right now' not to replace the things you have/do but to add into your life to share experiences with.

For example if you go to a nice restaurant, or you go to they gym or you go to a nice beauty spot, most of the times I'm happy to do these things by myself but even now and again you wish you were doing it all with someone special.

I'm in no rush that being said because I want to find the right one but it would be nice to find someone amazing to add and share these experiences with!","This is actually a really good way to put it. Yes I agree, or at least I might be a little different because I was a very happy single person, but now I desperately want a relationship. The feeling kind of just came out of nowhere for me. Is this what you mean? I do really wish I had someone to share experiences with."

dating,owahn1,2021-08-02 08:37:39,A girl called me cute and asked me out at the bar! Best day of my life.,"I was sitting at the table with a friend of mine(guy) and there were these 2 girls sitting on the table next to me. One of them got up and came to me and said ""I think you are really cute"" and damn it was the best feeling. 

I think women make move like these very rarely(and also they should do it more often lol). I have never had a gf ever in my life ( I am 24) and super shy. I am less shy now but still not a very social being(asked a girl only once till now). I couldnt believe that such a hot girl came up to me and said that and was thinking all the time if its a prank or no. We held hands at the table which was amazing and weird at the same time :P 

Later I pissed her off by saying - ""I hope you are not approaching me because you want me to pay for the drinks ;) "" I thought I was saying it in a flirtatious manner but she got really offended by that (noob move) 

I still cant imagine this happened. It kinda gave me confidence boost lol.
btw she also told me she and her friend both are bisexual. Later one more friend of them joined and all 3 of em had the same tatto. How cool is that

 Edit 1-  forgot to mention that it was her birthday. She did it on her birthday 
 omg

 
 Idk why but she blocked me on social media. That sucks but anyway it was a great 
 experience
 I didnt even think that this post would blow up like this! Well thanks for all the interesting comments and threads it has really helped me appreciate the positives of the experience.

 Also I just told my guy friend that she blocked me. he said ""Its fine your XP has 
 increased"" lmao",r/yesyesyesno
dating,kadss6,2020-12-10 11:34:14,Most embarassing date story? Mine is a doozy! Prepare yourself!,"Hi everyone, I'm a Reddit newbie and figured I'd dive in by sharing an embarassing story because we need more laughs in 2020. It's a bit long so bear with me.
So, after 2 weeks of me (33F) dating this guy I'll call Tom (29M), I had 1 week off from work. The connection was so extraordinary between us that he decided to take a week off too so we could go on vacation together. (Pretty fast I admit but hey when ya know, ya know.) Our 1st day we explored a quaint coastal town, ate a lot, laughed a ton and made out like teenagers every few minutes. 

As night fell, we needed to look for his car to return to our airbnb but couldn't remember where we'd parked. 
(I thought I'd saved the gps location and we followed it but to no avail.) After about 20 minutes of walking and endless chatter, there came a stomach gurgle which silenced me immediately. Not just a regular stomach sound, oh no my friends, this was more like a war cry...once the first was released the others followed suit and my stomach began to feel very much out of sorts. War had been declared.
I felt an accompanying wave of nausea and instantly regretted all the rich chocolate pastries I'd ingested earlier. (Damn my weakness for sweetness!)

Feeling humbled I fell silent because I knew from experience that if I were to awaken the sleeping dragon, all hell would break loose and with handsome Tom next to me that could NOT happen. I continued silently while he was animatedly telling me a story (I threw in the occasional haha, omg and really? to throw him off from figuring out that something was very very wrong)and started to feel cold (it was about 9 degrees.)
As if on cue for the chaos that was about to ensue, it began to rain...not just like a slight drizzle, no...torrential rain...like cats and dogs type rain...then the wind began to howl...NO JOKE. 
I swear the fx team up above was playing me HARD! I remember thinking ""ARE YOU FREAKING KIDDING ME?!"" Here I am in the middle of nowhere in a storm with all the shops and restaurants closed for the day and a hot stud at my side and explosive diarrhea about to spray from my butthole. I thought to myself ""This is it...this is how I die...oh cruel, cruel life..."" 

At that moment Tom looked to me and said ""you're awfully quiet all of a sudden gorgeous"" (the rain hid the beads of sweat that had accumulated from me tightly squeezing my sphincter muscles, silently screaming to my body that it was not yet time to release the Kraaken) ""let's hurry up so we could get out of this mess and be warm and cozy at home"" (sigh...so naive this young grasshopper) 
I then stopped, looked him dead in the eye and responded through semi-clenched teeth ""I can't walk fast right now...in fact I can't walk at all..."" Y'all...at that point I revealed the rumbles in my tummy to him...I was too far gone to be embarrassed...I was in survival mode! Death by diarrhea was NOT going to be written on my tombstone!

The only thing that prevented me from releasing myself there and then was Tom's presence as well as the fact that I was freezing and had on several layers and it was raining and I could NOT allow myself to end up covered in poop stains and then get into his car (which we still couldn't locate btw)...I was NOT about to poop myself in front of my potential future husband! NOT TODAY SATAN! I REBUKE THEE!

People of reddit...this is when I knew this one was a special one. The man immediately had a plan. He walked me to a closed shop to shelter underneath near a traffic light and said he'd search for the car. His phone had died so he asked for mine and took a video of where I was to be able to find me back if necessary. He then kissed me on my forehead and said he'd be back soon and that if I had to poop on the pavement to just do it (there were cars driving by btw.)
I sat in front the closed shop window (sitting was a lot better than standing...easier on my overworked sphincter muscles) and was shivering from the cold and the desperate need to release the poison from my bowels. 

After what felt like an eternity (and me wondering if this man had decided to just leave me and have a new S10 phone as his own) his red car honked and pulled up on the curb and the man GOT OUT in the pouring rain to get me and open the door for me as I hobbled in *yes I swooned despite the fact that I was low key dying.*

Guys I almost didn't make it back to our airbnb...the grimaces, moans and facial expressions were very UNSEXY (unless you're into that...different strokes for different folks yanno) and at one point Tom turned to me, took my hand and said gently ""If you need to poop in your pants and in the car you can. I have my dog's towel in the back. It's covered in white dog hair but who cares."" Y'all...if this ain't the one I give up on love!!

With every fibre of being in my body I willed myself NOT to give in to the demands of my bowels on this 1st day of vacation with this amazing man. FINALLY we got up to the airbnb (he ended up having to carry me) and as I sat on the toilet (after forcing him to go outside and listen to music with the headphones on) I finally released a gasp of simultaneous relief and anguish as I gave in to the sweet surrender and expelled every iota of demonic waste from the hell that was my bowels. I stayed on that seat until my legs went numb and I nearly blacked out. I even went back...4 times total. My guy took great care of me and made sure I was hydrated and that night after I felt better and laughed about the ordeal, we ended up making love 4 times(after I'd thoroughly washed every orifice of my being from the day's trauma)...and yes 4 times...the same number of times this princess had to use the porcelain throne. Romantic no? *double swoon* 

And yes to all the romantics out there, we are currently in the happiest, healthiest and most loving relationship. Let's see if in a few years I'll edit this to say we're still together? Hehe. For now I'll leave it here for you all to have a chuckle since I can more than laugh about it now.
Ironically enough I still can't allow myself to fart around him!

***EDIT*** we recently celebrated our 2 year relationship with a weekend trip to the place in this post!! Happier and more in love than ever. Definitely my person :)))",That's such a great story. A good man (or woman) knows that that can;t be helped and his reaction was pure perfection. Congratulations on a funny (in hindsight) start to a great relationship.
dating,mq7q46,2021-04-13 17:57:35,"He used me for sex, ghosted me, and is 12 years later now sending me a friend request.","I can't believe I was so torn up over this guy when I was 18. He was 25. I'm now 30 and all I can do is laugh and share.

We met on Myspace (I'm old). I was a naive, fresh-out-of-high school girl looking to finally have my first real boyfriend since I was never really noticed in school. He said all the promising, sweet things on the date, held my hand, told me he ""wasn't like the other guys"" (LOLOLOL), and that he wanted to be my boyfriend. I was so dumb back then that I believed anything. He just seemed so into me!

...until he wasn't. He said what he had to say to get me into his bed, and back then I was so afraid that he'd lose interest in me if I didn't do it. Only I quickly found out that he would lose interest in me anyway. I told him that I wanted to wait but he insisted that we do it, so I went along. Also, I admitted that I had a very bad cold and was barely functioning‚Äîkinda expecting sympathy‚Äîbut he kept pleading ‚Äúplease just go down on me already.‚Äù We hooked up 2 times and he suddenly became too ""busy"". After that, he hit me with the Slow Fade‚Ñ¢ until he no longer answered my calls. I cried my eyes out wondering why he'd pretend so hard to like me just to disappear after he got what he wanted.

Andddddddd literally 2 weeks later, turns out he was in a relationship with another girl that I went to school with. Same age as me. I saw their photos together online. She told me they met 2 weeks ago online (üòê). When I tried to tell her about what happened she insisted that I was jealous, lying, and then she blocked me! Lol. He blocked me too.

It's been 12 years since and guess what? I just got a friend request from him. Only now he‚Äôs nearing 40, still posting shirtless gym selfies, picked up a few kids along the way, and is rocking a man-bun with shaved sides... **dead stare** ü§£

Update: request declined",The people coming at you seem to be missing the point. He looks like a tool for friend requesting you. That is all.
dating,oic3h8,2021-07-11 20:34:42,"Men, you are not ugly. This is your real problem.","I noticed there were a lot of posts on here where men lament how difficult it is to find success on dating apps due to not having conventionally-attractive looks. I don‚Äôt believe this is the real issue. After spending some time flipping through profiles on Hinge, I believe most mens‚Äô biggest problem is that they seem to be a bit clueless about what photos to use/how to present themselves in the best light! I get it. Men on average are not taking as many photos of themselves as women to share on social media. You guys just gotta catch up! Most profiles I look at feature photos that are extremely awkward or off-putting. In fact, I have looked at profiles for guys that I know are actually very cute in reality and have been dumb-founded by the terrible photos of themselves they select.

The fact is, even the most beautiful person on Earth would look terrible if you captured them in bad lighting, bad posture, with bad grooming ecetera. Learn how to play to your features and qualities that make you cute :3 Ask your friends to help you take some photos to use for your dating profile next time you are hanging out. Your friends will know how to pose you and make you look your best.",[deleted]
dating,mcorai,2021-03-25 03:25:30,Please please please don‚Äôt tell me about the other people you‚Äôre dating.,"I understand that at the very beginning of the dating process, you might have several first dates lined up with multiple people. I have no problem with that as it can be necessary to go on many dates before finding someone you want to keep dating. 

I only bring all this up because of the 5 first dates I‚Äôve been on in the last year, three of the girls have though it was a good idea to talk about the other people they were going on dates with. Talking about what they did wrong... talking about what they did right... One girl told me about how the other guys were in bed, and another girl even directly compared me to another guys looks. 

It might be acceptable to tell the other person that you are currently seeing other people so as not to mislead them, but please do not discuss the dates or the people. I feel like I shouldn‚Äôt need to say it, but having it happen to me three times in more than a fluke. Having this information stresses me out and makes me feel like everything I do is being judged and compared to other people. Dating is supposed to be fun, not feel like an interview process. 

Please please please. Don‚Äôt tell me about the other people you are currently going on dates with.","Ohgod I'm so sorry you dealt with that. Talking about another's bed antics is definitely a big no no red flag.

EDIT: By bed antics I am referring to seemingly boastful statements or comments which specifically reference how another person made the subject feel. Obviously it's important to be open about sexual history when asked for but there's a difference between saying ""___ feels really good"" and ""when [Name] did ___, it felt really good"". No one wants to hear about your sexual satisfaction from another person on the first date."
dating,j4p8sl,2020-10-03 23:44:37,"PSA: If a girl is actually interested in you, she'll make it very obvious","She'll make time to be around you

She'll be more open to you talking to her

She will go along with your dumb attempts at getting closer to her (aka the old arm around shoulder thing at a movie, or any other physical touch)

She will take any form of flirting or humor from you as a positive, no matter how bad it is

She'll spend more time around you or with you

**If you're not getting any of these signs, there's a very very good chance she is not interested in you beyond a platonic friend**

The flip side to this is, unfortunately a lot of guys these days have **ZERO** girls interested in them.","For me,  people have to be pretty direct. I don't understand hints very well sometimes. I might get them, but my brain doesn't convert it and say ""maybe she likes me"" and I may think it, but then I second guess myself. So she has to directly tell me that she likes me"

And like bros, I was nervous but excited -- I have been on two dates ever, and I only found out they were dates after the fact, so this time I was gonna do everything right. I was dressed nice, I got a haircut, I wore **shoes** for the first time in 13 months.

We talked all day long how we both appreciate if our partners would be able to communicate everything they felt without the fear of being judged.
We ordered food, watched movies together. the next day when he was leaving, my eyes teared up for some reason. I became vulnerable in front of him and cried. Even after knowing It was too early to see if we were going to end up together or not, I hugged him and cried a little thinking this maybe the last time I am seeing him which I told him. I have been single for too long and since he was being very sweet the entire time we were together, I felt overwhelmed. However I told him it‚Äôs going to be tough for me to trust you given some very bitter past experiences but I appreciate the way he has treated me for the time we were together. 
Although it‚Äôs been a day and we are speaking, I feel like he is going to be very scared of me from here on and gradually withdraw. I feel extremely uncomfortable right now üòû","So nice of you to describe your feelings.I dont think he would withdraw specially when he treated u so nicely .He would appreciate u were emotionally overwhelmed.

I‚Äôm not ready to be a step parent and as much as your niece/nephew is adorable im going to automatically think it‚Äôs yours. Especially if you don‚Äôt acknowledge in your bio that it‚Äôs not yours. Just save everyone the confusion and maybe not include it.,"As a straight woman, I'm guessing men do this so women will think ""awww look at him, he's so fatherly!"". Another hypothesis is that men don't have a lot of photos of themselves and when they visit their baby nieces/nephews, the parent will take photos of them so they use it on their profile.

I'm glad bumble/hinge has the kids filter so people don't need to signal using kid photos now. I always thought it was cringy too.

Edit: just to clarify what I meant is you can put your views on kids on your profile. I‚Äôll always read it if it‚Äôs there. Yes it‚Äôs meant for filtering and in an ideal world, everyone would fill out their profile entirely but that‚Äôs not the case, thus your pool of available people will shrink by a lot."

I said ‚Äúok that was bad‚Äù SO I WENT IN AGAIN AND IT WAS BAD AGAIN. We had an awkward laugh, said goodnight, and I went into my apartment. He was super nice about the whole thing but I spent the next hour beating myself up over it. I sent him a text apologizing for being awkward and we talked about it, he said that HE felt like he was the one who made it awkward and basically we just decided that we were both weird about it and we were gonna move on from it because we like each other.

dating,hipuez,2020-06-30 15:46:34,Is this r/dating or r/Rant?,"Jesus. What is wrong with this subreddit? All the time I see posts about OLD, how men want only sex, how women have it easy on OLD, how unhappy you are that you are single.. will you cut it out?

No, posting here for the 1001th that ghosting sucks will not make people stop ghosting. Its part of the package of OLD and it will never stop. EVER. Same goes for hookups and ego boosters.

Here's one tip of advice for you: If you are not ready to be ghosted or have people wanting only sex, then you are not ready to use OLD. It is ok to not use OLD. But if you want to play the game, those are part of it.

Also, honest piece of advice for so many people here complaining that they are so unhappy single. If you are unhappy alone, chances are you will be unhappy with someone too. Your happiness is not the responsibility of anyone else but yourself. Get your shit together instead of hoping someone will fix you.",I don‚Äôt mind it. People should write what‚Äôs on their mind.

What‚Äôs more, for people that have all their photos with filters, how do you see things going when you meet up with the person? Are you going to tell them they can only look at you through their phone with a filter on? 

Dating is hard enough as it is, starting a potential romance with a lie is not going to help anything and only makes matters worse. Plus, it also says a lot about you as a person and shows you don‚Äôt think 1 step beyond what‚Äôs currently in front of you.

dating,iaxkls,2020-08-16 18:29:14,Dating is luxury for some people.,"I come across many posts here saying that  people who have not dated anyone by certain age are not datable.
People are guessing that something may be wrong with the person if they were not able to date anyone.

There are some people who may have never even thought of dating during school or college (I am telling this from perspective of being an Asian) only because they want to be totally focused on their studies.

I personally never wanted to date as I didn't wanted to get distracted from my studies. My family's financial condition was not very good and I always saw dating as a luxury which can be pulled off by people who had rich parents. 

In my teen years, I had to stay focused, I had to work extra hard for my own future. I never had the privilege of bunking a class or getting distracted by anything. 

I only could think of dating when I was financially stable, independent and was truly happy.

There may be many such people who spent their youth studying or building a career. There may be some introverts who have never spoken comfortably to opposite gender. If a person has never dated that means they have some strong reason to do so. Otherwise, honestly who doesn't want to date or have fun.

So please stop judging someone if they have never dated.
Consider yourself lucky if they are opening up to you, you may be already really special to them. If you by any chance can't handle being their first in everything, please back off.","Love this. It's hard to date when you are literally worried for your physical and mental survival, maybe why people say others should at least be working on themselves and getting secure before bringing in someone else in the picture."

It can be big or small, physical or emotional, no judgment here. 

For me it‚Äôs honestly smoking cigs. My ex smoked so much and our entire place reeked.  It took years to erase that smell from everything around me and I‚Äôll never go back. Not to mention the money and time aspect of it. No shade to smokers, everyone has there vices believe me I know that, but for a LTR, I couldn‚Äôt do it.","When they constantly blame everyone and anyone for their own wrongdoings, and are never able to admit when they're in the wrong."
dating,lke4ch,2021-02-15 13:55:17,Women need to stop being angry at men who stop pursuing them over poor communication,"I‚Äôm a guy and one of my pet peeves is poor communication. Over the last 6 months, i‚Äôve broken up with an ex, rejected over 5 girls ive been on a date with because of poor communication. Apart from my ex, all the other girls got angry when i told them that their poor communication is the reason as to why i don‚Äôt wanna pursue things any further(i communicated my wants right at the beginning). Last week, one of the girls had an angry outburst infront of my friends and hers calling me cold hearted because i didn‚Äôt wanna take things further due to her poor reply times. Yesterday, one of the girls messaged me saying she‚Äôs distraught that I‚Äôm not talking to her anymore, she used to reply between 3-7 days. Funny thing is, i warned her that I can‚Äôt stomach poor communication. She was begging to keep talking to me and i flat out refused. I‚Äôm currently single and I‚Äôm not settling for any girl who cannot give me what i want, I‚Äôm currently talking to a girl who‚Äôs communication is splendid. I think some women should stop getting angry at men stopping pursuing them

Edit: We are uni students we have all the time in the world. Why should i settle for someone who doesn‚Äôt communicate properly when there‚Äôs better options?üòÇ
Not some of you defending a girl who physically and verbally attacked me for rejecting her. If the roles were reversed and say a man attacked a girl for rejecting him, i highly doubt you lot would be telling the man that he dodged a bullet. Sounds like hypocrisy to me

Edit 2: This doesn't apply to all women. Only those with poor communication who attack men after they reject them. Have a blessed day <3",If you ask me poor communication=not interested end of story. It is what is. Move on NEXT. That's how I see. Gender doesn't matter.
dating,moq1re,2021-04-11 12:16:19,"Men shouldn't be expected to carry the entire weight of the dating experience, and women shouldn't be afraid to scare men away by ""chasing"" them and providing support.","I see so many posts on this forum (in fact one just blew up) about men having to bear the weight of the dating experience. When I say that, I am referring to being expected to pay for the dates, being expected to initiate interactions (both asking a girl out and continued texting/calling/maintenance of communication/etc), and the general assumption/expectation that men be the only one pursuing/chasing the relationship while the woman sits back and ""receives"".

Similarly, I see an enormous number of posts on here where women are in a panic because they're afraid they've scared a man off by doing too much. It's okay to pay for dates/share the cost, it's okay to ask the guy out first, it's okay to initiate communication and show your interest. There is no shame in any of that. And fuck the concept of ""chasing"". Nobody should be ""chasing"" anyone - if you have to chase somebody down, they're more than likely unavailable.

If a guy or girl has a problem with a balanced connection and acts some type of way or loses interest towards you because of some preconceived, prehistoric notion of how a relationship is supposed to go on their own timeline, it's safe to say they probably weren't worth your energy in the first place. All of this is of course with the caveat that the individual must first be interested in *you* as a person, and getting to know who you are sincerely, and also interested in the time investment of exploring a new relationship in the first place.",Interested people act interested
dating,ke0bwi,2020-12-16 02:28:41,"After hearing so many complaints by men who have no luck on apps, I find it surprising how many put little or no effort into their profiles or making conversation","Posting on a throwaway because I don't want this on my main. 

I'm an early-30sF who has only been in serious relationships and never traditionally dated. I started following this and other dating subs a year before I started using apps and the most common thing I read about was how hard the average guy has it. How women apparently only go for the top 20% of men so less attractive ones hardly get any matches and need to put in a ton of effort. As someone who is attracted to personality and has had feelings for multiple short, pudgy, bearded and/or bald men, I was fully prepared to ignore the hot tall bros and engage with the supposed 80%. Didn't turn out the way I expected.

First off, 6/10 profiles I came across had blank bios or something stupid like ""just ask"" and a single blurry photo. It was more like 8/10 on Tinder. I know a lot of women do this too, but considering men have a harder time getting matches, it seems like a no-brainer to write \*something\* personal and take better photos. 

Another complaint I heard frequently was regarding women not messaging first or really engaging in a conversation. I was happy to take the lead and make the first moves, but I only got messages back half the time (and I would open with a question or comment about something in their profile, not just sending ""hey""). Of the convos I did have, a majority were one-sided with minimal responses OR long-winded replies talking about themselves and not asking questions which was a turnoff. I won't even get started on the guys who immediately make perverted comments or turn the convo sexual.

FWIW I am 5'8, slim and have been told I am above-average looking. My profiles had several clear photos of my face and body (fully clothed, not sexual). I avoided clich√©s and overused jargon (ie - I love tacos and The Office!). 

Anyway, I deleted the apps after a couple of months and met my current BF irl shortly after. I recently talked to a friend going through the same thing. I thought maybe men didn't put much effort here in NYC where there are plenty of other ways to meet people (pre-COVID at least), but she's in suburban PA. 

Fellas, I sympathize and don't doubt you have it harder. I'm aware men outnumber women on the apps which stacks the odds against you. But I have to wonder if your lack of luck is because you're guilty of what I just described?",To me it seems the people (men and women) who put no effort in their profiles just don‚Äôt really care and use these apps more for shits and giggles than actually meeting people. (This probably isn‚Äôt the case just based off what I‚Äôve seen from a few friends who use tinder just to kill time here and there so I could be totally wrong )
dating,lc5ne0,2021-02-04 02:51:06,I wish I was hot (25f),"that's really it. that's all i wanted to say lol. i'm 25 and no guy has been interested in me, ever in my entire life. no one has ever wanted to kiss me or even hold my hand. i feel like i'm not a person sometimes. no girl makes it to 25 with this situation.

sometimes i think ""i'd give *anything* to be hot"" but then i remember that i have so much else going for me (great friends, a family that loves me, i'm in med school and graduating, going to be a doctor in a few months) .... but really what good is any of that if everyone else has someone else who's more important and i'm not a priority in anyone's life and i am working like 70 hrs a week just to come home to nothing and no one :/ 

sorry for whining. i am just really sad and don't know what to do.",It sounds like you are doing well in life. Feel proud and confident that you are crushing it.  You are young.  You will meet plenty of guys.  Hot means different things to different people.
dating,jkiykt,2020-10-29 21:16:16,My Date Said He Hates Unattractive People,"Unfortunately, the title is only the tip of the iceberg.

I (23F) had a dinner date with a guy (23M) I matched with on Hinge. We were ordering in and meeting at his place (dumb, I know). When I walk into his apartment, I immediately notice he has hair, dirt and dust all over the floor. It's a gorgeous two-story apartment, but his towels are dirty, he has no toilet paper, and there are stains all over his toilet bowl. He apologizes for the mess and very casually notes that he never cleans. I tell him his place is small and wouldn't be too hard to vacuum, to which he quickly rebuttled he would rather just pay for a cleaning service. 

His phone rings, and he answers a FT call from his friends who aren't quarantining to tell them he's for sure flying out to Atlanta tomorrow to join them for a week of strip clubbing. But as soon as he hangs up, he looks at me smirking and says, ""LOL I'm totally not going. I'll tell them something from work came up. I work at Google; people just assume I'm busy. Is that bad?"" He could tell I wasn't amused by the look on my face, and I replied yes to make things even clearer.

As we're waiting for our food to arrive, he starts washing dishes for dinner with a dirty sponge and complaining about how ugly he thinks Drake's son is. He says it's a shame when an attractive parent has an ugly kid, and that the same thing happened with Whitney Houston's daughter. Again, he was stunned when I said I thought they were all fine looking people, doubling down and insisting their kids were far uglier. He then stops scrubbing and asks ""Do you think you're attractive?"" To which I respond that I care far more about service and character and truly don't think about people's looks. He looked at me like I was full of shit. 

This led to his ranting about pretty privilege and how it was easier for me to make friends and get what I want in my career because I'm attractive (there's some truth to this, but who the fuck says this on a first date?) and creepily notes that my full lips and full eyebrows make me a 10/10. He brought this up 3x throughout the night and even launched into a 30-minute rant about how much he hates unattractive people. 

He quite literally said he doesn't have space in his life for people who aren't attractive, and that he hates unattractive people. The exception being those who are unattractive and incredibly smart-- he said he could probably find space for a few people like this in his network (I'd asked for clarification). He used the Snapchat CEOs as examples; they're young billionaires dating some of the most beautiful models in the world. He argued that most people would assume this is gross of them to seek out attractive women to date as soon as they get rich, but he said it's simply a philanthropic decision to boost their status and thus impact on society. 

More so, as a Christian man, he said it was his duty to have as much of an impact on society as possible, and in considering that only about 100,000 people in the world have a real impact in every generation, it's simply a must that he surround himself with attractive people and intelligent people, or ideally people who are both attractive and intelligent. I asked if he thought about the nuance of impact and how not all influence is positive, and he said that I was making him sound like a terrible person when it should be a compliment that he thinks I'm an ideal partner.

I try to keep my composure, so he doesn't try to kill me or anything, but I firmly note that I think there's incredible value in kindness and simply existing with a good heart. He seemed to dislike capitalism, so I suggest that basing people's value on their social status is inherently capitalist. He became flustered and retorted that kindness is a social construct. In his eyes, people who are fat or dumb but kind can make you feel good temporarily, but in the long run these people are useless and when they die, no one misses them except maybe a few people in their immediate circle, but even then their death doesn't mean much.

At this point, my vag is drier than the Sahara, and I start recording the convo in case he tries anything. When I pull out my phone, he asks if I'm bored and tries to change the topic by asking me about the South and how I managed to come out educated and attend an ivy. He said he has many stereotypes about the South that I didn't seem to fit except that I seemed very conservative because I was sitting far away from him and didn't seem to want to open up much to him yet. When I again gave a response he didn't like, he changed the topic once more, this time asking what I'd do if my kid got into an ivy but wanted to go to an HBCU (he graduated from an HBCU).

I said I honestly wouldn't care either way as it's not my decision to make. This led to-- you guessed it-- another rant. This time he rambles about how he wants five kids, so that two can attend HBCUs, two can attend ivies, and one can be the fuck up who becomes a musician or comedian (??!!!). He followed this up with, ""I'd take a chronically depressed child who went to Harvard over a happy kid at a trash school. I'll pay for their therapy-- I don't care. Any school ranked under NYU is trash. Except for like Wellesley and a few HBCUs because of systemic racism.""

At this point, I suggest I should head out soon. He gets flustered and says while he isn't going to pressure me to drink and wasn't trying to get me drunk, he thought it would be ""funny"" if we drank a lot before I left. I'm freaking out now and say I have work in the morning and that drinking a lot will inevitably get me drunk, so no, I'm not interested.

As I'm waiting for my car, he asks how many dates I'd been on since quarantine started, what qualities I liked in guys, and why my last situationship didn't work out. He also asked if I considered him a friend because I said I like to take things slow and build friendships on first dates (I am not the type to keep my distance on a first date, but you can understand why I told him this). When he realized I wasn't going to answer his questions, he tried going the route of opening up to see if I'd reciprocate, saying he'd been on four dates and had hooked up with an ex girlfriend while in quarantine. 

I put on my mask to avoid a kiss and unmatched him on Hinge while I rode back to my apartment. I told him I'd chat with him soon, but had no intention to. I lied partially for my safety, and truthfully I also thought it would be nice to give him a taste of his own medicine. 

Tl;dr Narcissistic asshole unabashedly revealed his entire life is built around status, and that he hates unattractive people, amongst other egregious things.",oh God what a nightmare! glad you made it home safe honestly

dating,cv4b1l,2019-08-25 04:49:47,"Met the cutest girl on a plane today and got her number, had to share the story with someone","I was flying home from CA and met this super cute girl while walking down the ramp to our plane. She's a biology student in Idaho with gorgeous eyes, a sweet smile, and frankly just stunning from head to toe. After only a few minutes we found several things we had in common, and I even got her to laugh a couple times. She ended up sitting way behind me on the plane but I really wanted to see if I could get her number. So I ripped out a page from the in-flight magazine and wrote her a note that said:

*As a scientist I'm wondering if you'd be willing to help me with a survey. I'm trying to find the best way to get the number of a cute girl I met on a plane (just in case I'm ever in southern Idaho) and wondering if a note is effective. If you would like to participate, would you be willing to rank its effectiveness on a scale of (000) 000-0000 to (999) 999-9999? For science. You can submit your survey by folding this piece of paper and leaving it in the storage door below the mirror in the bathroom behind you. If not, no worries and safe travels. :)*

So I take this note and walk back to the bathrooms on the plane, and as I'm making my way back to my seat I lean over to her and say ""I'm sorry, I think you dropped this"" and walk back to my seat. The flight had about another 90 minutes before landing, so I tried to wait toward the end of the flight and made my way back again. She had her eyes closed listening to music as I passed so I didn't get to see her, but sure enough I walked into the bathroom and her note was there! It said:

*My scientific curiosity is piqued! I'm happy to respond to your survey, as I always enjoy meeting new people. Oh, and my name is \_\_\_\_\_ by the way...""* WITH HER NUMBER!

She even kept my original note to her, hopefully because it was memorable? I can't believe it actually worked.

Also, here's how much I \*do not\* have game...I was so excited that I accidentally left the note in the goddamn bathroom! \*facepalm\* I got back to my seat, realized what I'd done, and practically sprinted to the back of the plane. A woman got out and took one look at my face and I knew that she knew. Haha, her face said it all. I said ""did I leave a piece of paper in here?"" and she said ""yes, I just threw it in the trash."" So there I am digging through the wet paper towels in the trash can like a goddamn maniac trying to find this note...I've got a couple people waiting for a bathroom poking their head around the door to see what's up, a flight attendant is asking me if I want gloves...but I found it! It was wet and a corner got ripped while I was digging but I'll be damned if I didn't get it.

So yeah, MT if you're reading this, you made my day. Hope you enjoyed it as much as I did :)",This made me smile like an idiot. Thanks for sharing! May your travels one day take you to southern Idaho.
dating,c8jmlg,2019-07-03 04:25:38,A reminder for myself and anyone else who needs it:,"If they really want to be with you, they will:

‚Ä¢ Reply to your text in a timely manner 

‚Ä¢ Text you first/again if they don‚Äôt hear from you

‚Ä¢ Take the effort to make plans to spend time with you

‚Ä¢ Ask about your day/care how you‚Äôre doing 

I think sometimes we (myself included) make too many excuses for the actions of others. We all have busy days/different ways of communicating but let‚Äôs be real, it takes 1 minute to draft a text and less time than that to put effort into showing you care for someone. You deserve that effort","So much truth to this. It's such a natural defense mechanism to think that they're just busy or maybe they forgot, but its rarely true. And it's very weird for me to put myself in their shoes because I don't even do that to my friends, much less someone I was in a relationship with.

A couple of years ago I lost my girlfriend in a car accident. It took me a long time to move forward with her loss and I'm even on the market again for dating. Recently, I hit a bump in the road where I feel as if I am being unsuccessful in the appearance area. For a little bit, I felt as if it was causing me to not have any successful dates with women.

Some examples of what I consider green flags are:

1. You don't get anxious or nervous when you haven't heard from the other person in a certain amount of time. They have told you ahead of time that they're going to be away from their phone for X period of time or you feel secure that there is probably a reason behind it
2. There is balanced communication between both people aka it‚Äôs not one sided 
3. You're excited to see them and hang with them
4. You don't feel like you need to hide a part of yourself! (This is usually a tell-tale sign for me!!)
5. They're actively asking questions and wanting to get to know you (it‚Äôs not just a monologue of them talking ooor only you asking the questions!!)

This is not an exhaustive list but these are usually signs for me that someone new I'm seeing is heading down a healthy direction! Hope this helps!!!","As a woman, probably my biggest green flag is when they are super supportive of me in my work without either putting me on a pedestal or being threatened by my success.

dating,f8dpgf,2020-02-23 18:44:30,RCMP saved my embarassing butt after a tinder date,"So I went to a tinder date's condo recently. He came down and to get me so I didn't have to buzz to get in (i.e., fob to get into building and elevator). 

We had dinner and got into it. Now, we realized we weren't a match so after we were done and the alcohol leaves my system, I was hoping to leave without waking him or any pleasantries. I did exactly that. 

Once I got to my car I realized I FORGOT MY PHONE. My phone with my driver's license, credit card, and more importantly, Google map to get me home!  It was 2:30am at this point and I was going through the directory at his building to find his name but couldn't find it. 

I didn't know his last name. I didn't know his buzzer code. I couldn't get back upstairs, I couldn't drive, and I did not have the direction to go home. 

Thankfully, the RCMP (royal Canadian mounted police) station was across the street so I had the most dignified walk of shame to the police. After explaining the situation, one of them just went into the station to get the master fob to the building so I can knock on my date's door instead of getting a full report... Since it was clearly embarrassing and I didn't know my date all that well for them to look him up...

The officers were super nice about it. One of them reassured me that they face different situations everyday and that as long as I was safe and could get home, he was happy. The other officer made me feel better by saying at least now I can have a great tinder story plus a potentially good online review after I get my phone back to tell the world how the RCMP really did serve the community that night. 

The best part was, once they got me into the building and up the elevator, they hid in the corner so my tinder wouldn't see them when he opened the door in his boxers. 

Let me just publicly praise the Coquitlam RCMP pair who got me through a tough and awkward night. Thank you for protecting and serving last night. I've never felt more safe and part of the community than I did last night when tinder opened the door.

Tldr: I left my phone at tinder date, didn't know how to contact him so the police helped out. I got my phone back with a great little tinder story.

TLDR; title. 

Been seeing someone for too long. Kinda fell in love, but they don‚Äôt want me. They don‚Äôt want a relationship, but keep giving me a relationship experience. We went on vacation, something couples do and again, I‚Äôm reminded that we are not together and probably won‚Äôt ever be. Again, I‚Äôm reminded that he will sleep with whoever he pleases should he choose to and only doesn‚Äôt because he doesn‚Äôt want to and somehow, he‚Äôs the one that‚Äôs irritated because I‚Äôm hurt when he says these things to me (and yes, I do realize it‚Äôs my fault). Oh, and I totally cried the whole uber ride home. 

But most importantly, I‚Äôm hurt because he doesn‚Äôt want me like how I want him yet he makes it so difficult to leave and I make my life hard because I can‚Äôt let go.

Yeah, it‚Äôs easy to say leave, but god damn it, it‚Äôs fucking hard because I fell in love. 

Sorry for the rant. Enjoy yourselves.

EDIT: Don‚Äôt want no ones sympathy. I own up to my fault. I know what I did. The feeling still sucks at the end of the day! I‚Äôm still hurt! That‚Äôs why there‚Äôs a venting flair. I‚Äôm venting! But everyone‚Äôs comments, even the ‚Äúnegative‚Äù ones, have helped a lot. Thank you everyone for your comments. ‚ù§Ô∏è

EDIT: Moral of the story, value yourself if you‚Äôre in this situation because clearly the other party doesn‚Äôt give a fuck, so it‚Äôs time for you to, and take care of yourself. Love yourself. Do fucking you, and do it unapologetically.

We all talk about avoiding red flags, until you realise you have your own. And it can be heartbreaking to realise and accept until it‚Äôs over. 

I met a guy 2 months ago that I thought was awesome. We went on a couple of dates. Some in person, some over call, and it was all amazing. I haven‚Äôt met someone that I clicked with in a really long time. He ticked so many boxes for me, I fell hard. 

But before I even knew it was a thing, I came to realise was that I had a lot of abandonment issues. I was clingy. I was constantly worried about losing him because I liked him so much. I felt anxiety when he wouldn‚Äôt reply to my messages within a certain timeframe. It wasn‚Äôt even because he wasn‚Äôt meeting deadlines, it was because I got anxiety that I was the only one excited. I wanted reassurance that he liked me as much as I liked him.

We had a conversation in which he said he wanted to take things slow, which I agreed to. But I grew to be distrustful when he wouldn‚Äôt reply to me all day until it was 6pm in the evening. He was a poor texter, but a consistent one. I should have valued his consistency rather than his frequency.

Someone told me that when being in a relationship, you should grow to be comfortable in the silence. Why should it matter if we trust them? I wish I had known that before I drove him away. 

Another lesson learnt, and I paid the price for it. I just wished it wasn‚Äôt with someone I valued so much.

Edit: Thank you guys for all of your advice. It‚Äôs incredibly validating to hear from similar people. It means a lot to me, and I‚Äôm learning so much from all of your perspectives","This happened to me a while ago. I thought a guy I really liked was ghosting me and I absolutely spiralled.

dating,selwcn,2022-01-28 08:21:51,Boyfriend and kink addiction,"I've been with my man for about 3 months now and everything has been going well(he's 6ft 6 and 160 lbs). But now I'm starting to think he has a porno addiction that comes from the male fantasy surrounding being a pizza delivery driver. We get pizza pretty frequently and I've noticed he's especially horny on these nights. I usually blow him every time we hangout, but on pizza night, he always pushes my head toward his member while we are cuddling and watching a movie. I end up blowing him 3-4 times every time we have a pizza party. 

It gets weirder. He rarely gets hard unless it's sexy time, but the last time we were together for our regular pizza party, I could see him hard through his sweatpants when he got up to get the pizza from the driver. I figured he could've just been excited for pizza. After blowing him once regularly, we continued our movie. He then left the room with the pizza box and when he came back he was naked with the pizza box covering his penis. He yelled delivery and looked at me, motioning for me to come look at the box. Confused, I went over and saw that he cut a hole in the box wanted me to suck him through the hole, like some kind of glory hole. Keep in mind, there were still slices of pizza in it. I started blowing him, feeling confused. He started eating a piece of pizza while I was doing this. I ended up getting pizza grease all over my face and bits of crust in my hair from the slices and him making a mess while eating. This made me break out with acne the next day.

I'm officially done dating,"So after breaking off a 5 year relationship, I thought I'd try to get back into it, well this girl I've been talking too for about a week now. Thought everything was goin good. Took her out to dinner last night, We were laughing, having fun, even made out a little before dinner.

She finished it, said she was going to the bathroom, 20 minutes later, I asked if someone could see if she was in there, Aaaand she's gone.

Took the free meal and dipped, Texted her twice last night to see if everything was okay, but she ghosted, along with blocking me on Facebook. So cooool. Cooool.

She still looked okay, so I just ignored it. Then, she decides to keep getting me drinks at the restaurant. I was unable to drive so she became the designated driver and went into a liquor store and got a bottle of rum, gave it to me and of course I was blind to it. At some point, I was passed out and she used my finger to cash app her some money. Thank god it was from a side bank account with little money. Also she tried using my credit cards, funny thing is I changed my address and city, so the zip code she put in always declined them. Anywho, serves me right.

First of all this doesn't serve you right, what happened to you was wrong and also not your fault. This behavior was predatory and if I'm not mistaken a crime as well.

dating,hxq1y4,2020-07-25 17:00:34,Most people can't appreciate being single until they've been in a relationship,"I've been in a few relationships before and do enjoy being single, so this is the angle I'm coming from

 We need to stop telling people that have not been in a relationship before that they should just enjoy being single. They have every right to be upset about not having this as a life experience yet, because it is a very common human experience to have. Yes it does no good to mope around and be sad because of your circumstance, it also does no good in invalidating people's very frustrated feelings of not having experienced a relationship yet.","As someone who has been single for far too long, I initially appreciated this sentiment of ‚Äúenjoying being single‚Äù but have come to hate it. It‚Äôs good advice for people who have options and can easily find people to be in a relationship but realize they have the power to take a break or keep things casual. But for the rest of us it gets old.

Personally, my favorite couples are those who are highly independent people. If you‚Äôre in a relationship and thinking back to your single life, perhaps your relationship has progressed in a different way than you would have hoped for. Maybe it‚Äôs time to look for something different?"

dating,o7bo6v,2021-06-24 23:33:20,How to meet people without using dating apps,"Even though many people use dating apps and I have nothing against them, I still prefer meeting people organically / in real life. 

One good way to do this (and also how I‚Äôve met friends as well as some people that I‚Äôve gone on dates with) is by going to the same place repeatedly. 

For example, I would go to the same fitness class or a certain cafe weekly and I would start to notice the regulars. I will then become more comfortable introducing myself and they are probably more comfortable introducing themselves too because we‚Äôre doing this shared activity regularly!! 

Also if you think about it, that‚Äôs a reason why you see many people get together in college or from a workplace because you‚Äôre all going to this same place at the same time every week!

Also it‚Äôs great because you‚Äôll find likeminded people, people who share your same hobbies so you have that common ground already!",[deleted]

I was recommended to do that by one colleague.

dating,hwctqk,2020-07-23 09:41:54,Being told a person doesn't like you (fx) is 100 times better than being ghosted.,"The opposite of¬†love¬†isn‚Äôt hate,¬†it's indifference.¬†Ghosting, for those of you who haven‚Äôt yet experienced it, is having someone that you believe cares about you, whether it be a friend or someone you are¬†dating, disappear from contact without any explanation at all.

Ghosting isn‚Äôt new‚Äîpeople have long engaged in disappearing acts‚Äîbut years ago this kind of behavior was considered limited to a certain type of scoundrel. In today‚Äôs¬†dating culture being ghosted is a phenomenon that approximately 50 percent of men and women have experienced‚Äîand an almost equal number have¬†done¬†the ghosting.
Despite how common ghosting is, the emotional effects can be devastating, and particularly damaging to those who already have fragile¬†self-esteem. 

People who ghost are primarily focused on avoiding their own emotional discomfort and they aren‚Äôt thinking about how it makes the other person feel. The lack of mutual social connections for people who met online also means there are fewer social consequences of dropping out of another‚Äôs life. 

The more it happens, either to themselves or their friends, the more people become desensitized to it, and the more likely they are to do it to someone else.
I done it when I was younger, but it is such a cowardice thing to do.
 So my point is lets not ghost anyone anymore.

DAMN 1K LIKES! THANKYOU 
( also I can't even like all the comments anymore I'd be on my phone all day.) 

I (24f black) wouldn't date someone with kids because I don't want kids and I want to be someone s number one. I don't wanna be someone's step parent and I have to care for them. people can feel this way but we're called every name in the book for turning down someone with a kid. I told a guy no because he had a teenager and he kept trying to get me to like him. I added him and then he ended up calling me "" unattractive because I'm a broken person and no one wants that"" . It makes me sad when people dog me out for turning them down. Better someone turn them down than they mistreat someone's kid or they neglect them. 
(Please delete if not allowed)","You know what? This is fair. It‚Äôs better that you‚Äôre up front. You gotta do what makes you happy and if kids aren‚Äôt it, then you shouldn‚Äôt let people make you bad for not wanting to date someone with a kid.  You also

dating,s2e1as,2022-01-12 19:02:25,Is it weird to keep a Google Doc about your partner?,"Sometimes, when my(26F) gf(25F) says something that she likes or dislikes, I take a note. Things like opinions on colors, brands of food, what type of flowers she likes, etc. I do this because if I want to get her a gift or something like that, I want to make sure it's something she'd actually enjoy. It started as a notes app doc in my phone, but I moved it to a Google doc as it got longer. I still mostly access it on my phone. The doc is literally titled ""[NAME] likes/dislikes""

I recently mentioned the google doc to a friend who thought it was kinda creepy? She didn't like the idea of someone ""documenting her."" I've always viewed it more as a memory aid. Things I wanted to remember to be a thoughtful partner but wasn't sure I had the mental capacity for. I haven't shown my gf (or anyone else. I just mentioned it to the friend) the doc. Should I? It has my thoughts on her reactions to different things so it feels a little weird to just dump a lot of info at once in what feels like a cold way.

EDIT: for all the people asking, yes I have ADHD. Also, I'm a girl. The misgendering doesn't really bother me though I assume you just missed that detail.

EDIT 2: Omg so many responses. Thank you all so much! There seems to be some confusion on what ""thoughts on her reactions to things"" meant so I'll give one example: I noticed a trend of all her beverages being fruit-flavored so I noted 2 of them (peach snapple and her favorite cocktail) and then made the general note ""fruit in beverages seems to be good."" I probably don't NEED that note to remember it, but the thought was in my head and I wanted it on the paper. Some people compared the doc to a journal and that feels somewhat accurate. That might also explain why I feel weird about showing her even though I really don't want to keep secrets.",I think it‚Äôs cute actually.
dating,jumjls,2020-11-15 14:19:31,"I‚Äôve been paying for onlyfans lately just to feel wanted by women, and it‚Äôs really hit me hard how lonely I must be","
I feel really stupid. I‚Äôm 22 and while I‚Äôve never had sex or a relationship, I‚Äôm not like a fedora wearing neckbeard who hates women. I have loads of friends who are women, I dress pretty well, I look a lot better now than my ugly duckling high school years, etc. For some reason though, probably from being such a late bloomer, I‚Äôve just never had a girl in real life look at or talk about me in that way. I get tinder matches and all that stuff, but it never really leads anywhere and just feels pointless and hollow.

When I‚Äôm paying for a girls onlyfans and you‚Äôre getting content like messages, pics and videos, ratings, telling you how attractive you are and how much they want to fuck you, etc., it may be completely fake, but it‚Äôs the closest I‚Äôve ever had to having someone express feeling that way about me. It sounds so stupid; deep down I know it‚Äôs not real, that I‚Äôm paying a girl just to tell me all the things I want to hear, but I‚Äôve went 22 (almost 23 years) without a single soul telling me similar things and honestly it kinda fucks with me. I feel like there must be something inherently wrong with me or something. 

So to have someone tell you otherwise, that they want you, etc. it feels amazing. At the time I suppose. Then it‚Äôs all over and your left with your thoughts and you feel dirty and stupid and used for your money until the next time rolls around and your horny and desperate enough to hear those things from anyone that you‚Äôll do it all over again.

For a little bit it makes me feel wanted and noticed, but I feel like a fucking loser for it too afterwards, and I know getting false validation as a crutch for real connection is gonna stop me looking for something real long-term, but it‚Äôs been so long that it feels like I‚Äôll just never find that and this is the best I‚Äôll get. I just feel so lonely man, and I can‚Äôt believe this is the level it has got to.

dating,iru7ns,2020-09-13 07:57:07,"Why you‚Äôre not going on dates from Tinder, Bumble, Hinge Etc","It is you. For a long time it was me too. I was never hitting home runs on the match front but would garner one or two decent matches a week. I would approach every match in a polite manner, talk about the same mundane safe topics like travel, interests and hobbies. I generally just tried to keep the conversation going, sometimes up to a month or so at a time to try build connections and really it was a massive waste of time, and I was literally after years of on and off online dating going nowhere.

So August rocks by and I suddenly had an epiphany after a girl started taking 3-4 days to reply to messages - the conversation was boring. I wasn‚Äôt excited, sure to hella she wasn‚Äôt either.

So, I asked her to do a phone call, we vibed and she asked me out - legit first time I‚Äôd even considered suggesting a phone call with any of my matches, literally learnt more in an hour of talking on the phone and would have undoubtedly lost that match had I continued to play it safe.

Since I actually realised how much easier it was to form a connection through the phone, in the last 3 weeks I‚Äôve started suggesting a phone call within the first 5 or so messages to all of my matches. Been on 5 ‚Äòphone dates‚Äô and 2 actual dates! Can‚Äôt believe the difference it actually makes, and although the first one was kinda awkward, I‚Äôve started to develop a real technique to them! 

So if this sounds like you, get your match on the phone. Learn what really makes them tick, stop wasting time as one of their other matches won‚Äôt be.","I have horrible phone anxiety, can't do it. If we're already dating, sure, but no calls out of the blue"
dating,rt32i4,2021-12-31 20:55:50,I think my gf has an unhealthy obsessive relationship with her dog. Family are telling me to run,"I met my gf on tinder, I already knew she loved dogs because in her bio it said ‚Äúdon‚Äôt swipe if you‚Äôre not a dog lover‚Äù, I still swiped on her because I do love dogs, I had a dog growing up who I loved so much. 

Me and my gf are both 23 if that matters, anyways we have been dating for about 5 months now, I really like her and I like being with her she‚Äôs a really caring and a passionate person but I do feel like she has a weird obsession or unhealthy obsessive relationship with her dog. She adopted this dog a month before she met me, the dog is about 1 years old now. 

‚Ä¢She had a birthday party for this dog at the dog park

‚Ä¢she lives in a two-bedroom apartment and uses the second bedroom for a ‚Äúpink themed dog room‚Äù  which basically is a room with all the dog‚Äôs toys, play room area, portraits/pictures, not to mention that her dog has her own closet in this room filled with the dog‚Äôs clothes, shoes/boots, many different collars, bandanas, ETC. (her dog doesn‚Äôt even sleep in this room but she still gives this dog a whole room) 

‚Ä¢They share the same bed! I thought this was strange because she cuddles her dog and falls asleep like that. This dog sleeps with a pillow on its head lol. I don‚Äôt know it just looks very odd to me

I find it creepy that when I stay over her place, we sleep with the dog. The dog isn‚Äôt even on the foot of the bed, the dog‚Äôs head is where our heads are and the dog shares my girlfriends pillow with her. Her dog snores and it‚Äôs just annoying that her dogs face is just where our faces are. I‚Äôve asked her to move the dog to the foot of the bed and she has, but the dog wakes up in the middle of the night and will put itself back on the pillow next to my gf

‚Ä¢most of the times when I ask her what she wants to do, it includes her dog. For example, we were getting bored of the things to do in our small town and I asked her what she would like to do, she will say things like ‚Äúthe dog park‚Äù, ‚Äúthe river walk‚Äù (which is basically a large open park where people bring their dogs and kids) or she will suggest dining at some bar/restaurant that allows outside dining so she can bring her dog 

‚Ä¢she will sometimes refuse plans if it requires us to leave her dog for more than 5 hours (says her dog has separation anxiety and she needs to take her potty every few hours)

‚Ä¢she has SO many clothes for her dog

‚Ä¢brushes her dogs teeth every single day, has all these dental products for her dog like dental mouth wash, two different toothpastes, dental treats, and dental flossing toys 

‚Ä¢she spends so much money on treats, clothes, and toys for this dog like everyday there‚Äôs a new package it seems like.

I also understand this is all her money and she is entitled to do whatever she wants with her money, it‚Äôs just kind of concerning! 

‚Ä¢this dog has it‚Äôs own Instagram account 

‚Ä¢on her photo album in her phone, I swear it‚Äôs only pictures of her dog, you‚Äôll rarely find a pic that isn‚Äôt of her dog 

‚Ä¢she overly posts pictures of her dog on social media 

‚Ä¢she talks to her dog in a baby voice and carries her around like the dog is a small infant. (The dog is about 33 pounds and is a medium sized breed) 

‚Ä¢she literally kisses and hugs her dog and tells her how much she loves her every second 

‚Ä¢She has stated she likes her dog better than most people. She has made comments about how she values dogs more than babies. She finds babies annoying and dogs cute. (Which is fine, it is her opinion that she likes dogs more than babies but that was her explanation of why she values a dog‚Äôs life over a babies). Because of these remarks I am kind of scared since she seems like the person that would put her dog before anyone else. I‚Äôm actually terrified and concerned for her if something ever happens to this dog because I don‚Äôt think she can live without her. Everything just seems to revolve around this dog. 

I just found a lot of things that she does to be obsessive and just kind of weird. I guess I just need to know if this is normal behavior or not? I just don‚Äôt know how to address this with her without hurting her feelings also

EDIT: I‚Äôve posted an update.","If it makes you uncomfortable now, that feeling will be worse in a few months. You‚Äôre going to say something and it‚Äôs going to cause conflict. Do what you will with that information."

I pulled up to the table the girl was sitting at and immediately noticed she had backup; sitting behind her was another girl who looked about the same age, just staring at her laptop with no headphones on. I understand why a lady would bring some reinforcements(There are some skeevy dudes out there), but it was about one in the afternoon inside a lively coffee shop, what really was I gonna be able to do? The worst part is, the spotter was sitting RIGHT behind my date and kept shooting me weird glances. I'd consider myself to be a fairly convivial person, but I was finding it very difficult to hold a genuine conversation when I know a third party is scrutinizing and judging my every word. Also, my date's boring and uninteresting talking skills were not doing me any favors. About twenty-thirty minutes in, I saw my date give her backup a look. The backup then proceeded to walk out. No less than a minute later, my date received a phone call where she then told me, and I shit you not, that her refrigerator was leaking and that she had to go. She then proceeded to get up and walk in the same direction her backup walked. All I could think was ""thank god that is over"". I have not been that uncomfortable in a while.

dating,yns1jj,2022-11-06 14:56:05,"No, I will not lower my standards.","I hear it all the the time. That women are too choosy, that they want the moon and have nothing to offer for it. That if you want to be with someone you have to lower your standards. 

The truth is though. I've already had that relationship. The one where I did absolutely everything to make it work. He didn't make money? That's okay, I've got enough for both of us. He didn't have time to plan dates because of his job? That's okay, I can bring the romance. I was best friends with his family,  with his friends, fucked him regularly, worked out, had my own hobbies, my own life and made sure he was a big part of it. He still cheated. He still criticized everything I did. He still brought my self esteem so low that I honestly did believe that I was worthless. 

So no. I will not lower my standards of wanting a partner who has emotional awareness, emotional maturity, ambition for his future, cognizance of his past. I will not lower my standards of wanting someone who communicates healthily, who works through his trauma, who wants a partner to build a future with.

And if you tell me that I'm asking for too much, that no one will meet those expectations. Then so be it. Because I've already had the relationship with someone who doesn't genuinely know or love himself let alone know or love me. And I'd rather be alone.

Edit to add: I know that plenty of folks are saying that this is not what people mean by ""lower your standards"", we're talking requirements tied to looks. But unfortunately, in my experience I've met plenty of folks in the dating world who thought these ""basics"" were asking for too much. Hence my vent. I hope I'm wrong and maybe I just had a string of really bad dates. But based on some of the responses here I don't think I'm the only one out there being told that their basic requirements are ""too high"".

Second edit to explain my ex a bit more since this has come up a couple times:

I didn't pick a ""top 10% guy"". By the rules of the internet- he was not 6ft tall, he didn't have a 6 pack, and he was in a residency program so he didn't make that much money. 

I chose him because he made me laugh, he matched my energy, he enjoyed how weird I was, he had direction and ambition, and he seemed like a genuinely caring person. And if you ask his family and friends, they would still say that he is. But being in a relationship with him? At first he was great. But little by little he became controlling and selfish.  

For what it's worth i don't think he was an evil, unempathetic person. Just someone who behaved selfishly, put his partner last, and got comfortable with me putting in a majorityof the effort. You know, that classic ""now that i have you, i don't need to try"" sentiment. I didn't grow up with healthy relationship role models so I stayed much longer than a sane person would have, I had to learn the hard way I guess. 

But believe me, he didn't fit the online dating perfect guy physical model, he just seemed like he had a great personality in the beginning. After that it became a frog in boiling water situation.","I'm the same with women. If I die alone, whatever. At least I can say I wasn't miserable."

My general rule of thumb is that I give these women A DAY before I stop talking to them. Does it decrease my options? Yeah. But self respect is way more important than keeping a conversation with a brick wall in the form of a person. 

Seriously. And the funniest thing about all of this is that these same women complain about men playing games with them! My initial reaction to someone not putting an effort into talking is that they're not interested, and I quickly move on. I believe most healthy-minded people would take the hint and keep it moving.

I wouldn't consider myself shy or anxious, but I really don't have a very high libido and I don't like the idea of casual sex/picking up girls just for sex or FWB, personally. I've done it before when I was 19 and the deed itself felt incredibly uncomfortable. It wasn't a bad feeling in the form of anxiety, it just felt wrong and I wish I hadn't done it.

It's not like I'm waiting until marriage, but I think I have more stereotypically 'girly' feeling about it in the sense that I want to wait more than a few dates before doing the deed. I'm just not sure if this is 'beta' and screwing myself over because I do like sex and I have, and will continue to, miss out on plenty of sex because I want to wait, but I also feel like I'm being true to myself sexually in admitting my genuine discomfort in jumping into it too quickly. Is it fine to just want to wait a while?",Nah dude. 22M here and I‚Äôm the same way. Only been with one girl and even though I‚Äôve been single close to a year I don‚Äôt go looking for casual hookups either. Nothing wrong with it at all
dating,id06xm,2020-08-20 00:39:27,Why do this?,"I had a date with someone from Hinge, made the reservation for a rooftop bar (15 mins walk from me) at 7:30 tonight. Texted the dude if we were still on for tonight this morning and he confirmed: ""Should be! Let's hope the rain clears up"" 

I text him around 5:30 ish to say we have good luck, the rain has cleared; so I'll see him at 7:30 at the bar.

Then... nothing. 

I give this dude the benefit for the doubt, he could text me once he gets there, and since I live close enough I can just wait to leave. 

Edit: sorry if this wasn't clear, I was waiting at home, if he still showed up and texted me to say he's there or ask where I was, then I would say I'm running late and walk over. But he never texted. Period. After his ""should be"" message. 

It's now 8:36, he's unmatched me on Hinge. No text, no explanation, nothing. 

Why? Why do this? Is it that hard to tell me you don't wanna go on this date?

dating,ho1yrf,2020-07-09 12:09:53,My WORST Date Ever!,"Hey everyone, long time lurker, first time poster. You know the drill. Also, I'm on mobile. 

I thought I would share a funny dating experience with you all, maybe some people will get a laugh at my expense. Enjoy! Also, buckle in, cause' this isn't a short story. 

I (22f) went on a date with a guy (25m) a few months ago (pre-Covid). He seemed nice enough over text, and we had some similar interests, so I agreed to a date pretty quickly. I suggested a quick coffee date for a first time, but he was really insistent on ""taking me out for dinner, on him"". 

I'm a laid back gal, so I said, sure, let's go. We sit down at this Mongolian restaurant. Waitress comes by, and I order soup. As this is happening, he is talking OVER the waitress trying to take my order. At one point, the waitress literally stopped speaking to me, turned a full 90 degrees, and just stared at him with her lips together. I don't blame her. 

He laughed like it was a joke (?), THREW his menu up in the air for her to catch, and said he was ordering for me. She caught it, cause she's a great waitress, and simply turned back to me to take my order. Wanting this date to end already, I just order a bowl of soup (I hoped I could eat it quickly, pay, and get the heck away from this man). 

At this point he's ordered, although he said that his ex was ""the kind of bitch that can't take a joke."" I have no idea if that was a dig at me, his ex, or some combo of both... 

THEN, he starts going ON, and ON, and ONNNN about his ex. He called her every colourful name in the book. I don't mind swearing, but I do mind the use of the c-word in a crowded restaurant filled with children. I asked him to stop swearing so loudly, and he basically blew me off saying I was ""being ridiculous"". The angry eyes of the other diners didn't strike me as ridiculous, but okay. 

My soup finally arrives (let's be real, it had probably been 10 minutes, but every minute was agony). At this point, he hasn't done any of the following: 

A) introduced himself in person; he just sat down with no introduction
B) asked me anything about myself
C) Stopped his monologue about his ex long enough to breathe 

I use my food arrival as an opportunity to cut him off, and to change the subject. I ask him about our common interest - video games. I hoped maybe he would answer, then I could answer, but instead he stands up, and tells me we're going on a walk. 

I point at my soup, which is hot, but growing colder by the second. I ask if I can at least, finish part of my soup before it gets cold. He denies this request, and holds out his hand for me to grab (what a gentleman *eyeroll*). So, I call our extremely patient waitress over and ask to get it packed up. Keep in mind, his order is still somewhere in the kitchen, so I don't understand why he wants to leave without it. My BS-senses are tingling, so I tell him I have to use the washroom. 

Before he can say anything, I literally SPRINT to the ladies room. I call my best friend, and tell her to call me in 3 minutes with SOMETHING, ANYTHING, to get me out of this date. She's chucking a little, and I can't blame her. I'm a grown, adult woman standing in the toilets of a Mongolian restaurant begging my friend to get me out of a situation I put myself in. 

When I get back, his food has arrived and he has now, apparently, decided to stay (?). My soup is a bit chillier now, but tasty. He speaks super briefly about video games - but then goes right back to talking about his ex, what games they used to play, and, of course, what a bitch she is. 

I gently stop him and say, ""Hey, I'm uncomfortable with this line of conversation. I understand you dislike your ex, but surely you have other interests?"". He takes this as an opportunity to tell me about how his ex stalked him, and apparently stole something from him (?). 

At this point, the clouds part, and an angelic voice in the form of my ringtone sings out across the restaurant. It's my friend, telling me she... Oh no! She what? Broke her ankle falling down the stairs at her house? Oh god! I, of course, being the good friend I am, rush to help.  

I tell him I have to leave, it's an emergency. I stand up, but so does he. He says something about me trying to ""escape the best date he's ever had"". I chuckled, and tried to move around him, so I can get to the exit (and my car). 

He stops me with his arm on mine. I pull away, but I'm pretty small, so I'm not even sure he noticed my attempt. He tells me he NEEEDDSS a ride home, that he lives on the other side of town, and could I please drive him. At first I'm saying no, that I have to go, that it's an emergency. I even offered to give him a 20$ for a cab (anything to get away!). Then he points out we are in a bad part of town (he's right) and if I want his ""dead, lifeless body"" on my conscience. 

Ugh, fine. I agree to drive him home, against all better judgement. The drive is quiet, for once. I've resigned myself that I will not be able to get a word in edgewise, but he seems to realize he's being ditched. I don't really care, he isn't a very nice person. 

As I pull into his driveway, I put the car in park. I turn my head slightly to look at him, asking if he has everything (I do not want this man to have any excuse to contact me again). Keep in mind, my body language is screaming that I don't like him. I'm leaning away from him, despite facing him, and my face has morphed into a nasty scowl. 

This FUCKER had the absolute balls to try to kiss me! Read the room, buddy. I shove him back but he pushes against me anyway, kissing me on the lips. I bit him, hard, and told him to get the hell out of my car. He calls me a ""fucking tease"" but leaves. Thank god. 

I did make it home, and yes, my friend made a MIRACULOUS recovery. 

The story ain't over yet folks. 

About two weeks later, he's been texting me non-stop (I'm talking 3am, 4am, 5am texts). Finally, I simply text back that I'm not interested. Well. 

He first starts insulting me, THEN he apologizes (keep in mind, I'm getting about 30-40 texts all within 5 min during this convo). Then he starts trying to BARGAIN with me to sleep with him. He says things like ""I'll never bother you again, but I really want to f*ck you"". And ""Please, just have sex with me. Please?"" 

I tell him to, frankly, get bent. I now realize that he's a ""NiCE gUy"" to the extreme.  I blocked his number. 

Well, that's my worst date ever! One for my history books, at least. So, pro-tip to any would-be daters out there - maybe don't talk about your ex the entire time?","I literally screamed ‚ÄúNo!‚Äù At my phone when you said you agreed to drive him. We all make stupid mistakes in the moment - I get it. But girl, you had the perfect out: ‚Äúmy friend is in a lot of pain and I need to get her to the emergency room immediately!‚Äù"
dating,hdzsu5,2020-06-22 20:10:45,"If someone says to you that they had a good time and want to see you again etc, PLEASE say it back to them if you feel the same way",I met up with a guy last week and it went really well and we‚Äôre still texting. I keep telling him that I want to see him again and that I miss him and can‚Äôt wait to hold him again and he just replies with stuff like ‚ÄúYou will again soon‚Äù and ‚ÄúAwwww you‚Äôre so cute‚Äù. I just want to know that he feels the same way about me so I said to him ‚ÄúSo you don‚Äôt miss me thennnnn‚Äù in a jokey way and he said that he thought it was just a given that he misses me too. No it‚Äôs not a given. Sometimes you just have to say things explicitly otherwise they will never know. Just wanted to give this small bit of advice to people.,I thought I was giving advice but actually I got very helpful advice instead. Everyone‚Äôs telling me to slow it down and be less clingy. I do recognise that fault in myself so I will work on it. Thanks everyone
dating,o06ivw,2021-06-15 05:19:58,Girl said she just wants to stay friends. Thank you.,"Had my first date with a classmate that went well, and I could sorta tell she wasn't interested. I kept reading that girls might not show what they feel so I was ignoring it for the most part as she was still participating in the conversation and I asked for another date.

A few days later she told me she wasn't interested. I just thanked her for being straight forward and giving me a chance. Girls, do that more often please. Guys, don't get angry about it so that they do it more often.

Edit: it also freed up a lot of anxiety from the suspense in between dates 

Edit 2: I asked for the second date sorry for that","You handled that in a very mature way. 
Congrats bro, you are a reasonable human."
dating,jdzfom,2020-10-19 10:50:22,"If the guy didn‚Äôt message to confirm before the date, assume that it would not happen, relax and enjoy your time","I‚Äôve (F26) been seeing this guy (M30) a few times. Yesterday we planned to meet for dinner after 6:30. We talked about it on last Tuesday and he said okay but the whole day yesterday I didn‚Äôt hear anything from him like to confirm when is good because he had work until 6:30. About 7:00 I messaged ‚ÄúHey‚Äù, no response. But after an hour I said ‚ÄúI guess we‚Äôre not seeing today?‚Äù He replied immediately ‚Äúis it too late?‚Äù. I said no but I didn‚Äôt hear from him so I didn‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on. His excuse was ‚Äúhis phone hasn‚Äôt been charged‚Äù. Um well you have a whole day dude?! This was not the first time he had this attitude. I mean even though we agreed to meet on a specific day, at least confirm it maybe 2 or 3 hours before, don‚Äôt you think? Or worse, it could be a cancellation but it‚Äôs better said something than a silence. It happened once but that time I did text and ask for his confirmation and we agreed when is good for both. But this time, there was nothing so I told him I decided to stay home and watch a movie. He did reschedule the next day but I‚Äôm not available then he didn‚Äôt say anything more.

After that I thought I don‚Äôt feel what‚Äôs going on between us is okay. I messaged him told him I was excited to see him but I felt let down because he didn‚Äôt show much effort and interest. I said if this is the way he dates then it‚Äôs not my style. He read and was silent. That‚Äôs fine by me. At least I spoke out what I want and express my feelings. Him? I feel like he doesn‚Äôt have his balls to just tell me.","He's not only a jerk but also a poor communicator which are both terrible.

I totally agree with you, poor communication especially from someone you've not been together for so long is a red flag. It causes anxiety, over thinking and second guessing which are not worth it. Then you make the extra effort to double text or call and there's no enthusiasm at all? That's where you read the room and focus on something else cuz that ain't it.

I wish people would communicate effectively, it's okay if you're not feeling the other person, just be decent about it. Let the other person know, respectfully ofc don't be rude just make it clear that you're not into it."
dating,us1cnu,2022-05-18 01:15:08,"""Get in shape, get a degree, get a job, get a car, buy a house, girls will flock to you""","I'm just thinking back to my days in high school were I'd hear this from adults around me. Oh boy what a lie that was, after achieving all of that dating is still excruciatingly difficult. It's a miracle to even match with a woman who works at Walmart and lives with her parents, and even then if you manage to engage in conversation you'll eventually get ghosted. Even asking girls out in real life it seems like you're competing against dudes online. I feel like I got scammed and I want a refund.

Edit: this got a lot more attention than I thought it would. I wrote it in the heat of the moment while frustrated and didn't mean to upset anyone. I respect Walmart and other employees and I think they should be paid way more than they are. I don't think less of anyone based on the job that they work, as I have been there myself and it's really tough!

Edit #2: after talking to you all I realize now that I need to work on my insecurities and on being more confident in approaching women, not just expecting them to ""flock to me"" like I did. I should also be thankful for what I have accomplished for my own sake and spend some time being doing some self-development and work on being happy on my own. Thank you all for the feedback and for making me take a hard look at myself!","Yeah, you kinda have to cultivate a personality, interpersonal and conflict resolution skills too.

Then we chilled in my car at a service station for a while and got soft drinks and stuff, so we weren't super early for dinner which we had booked. Then we went for dinner, finished up and just chilled in my car in the car park and ended up just looking at each other and her going 'are you gonna kiss me then' and well, then we kissed for a while, and her liptsick tasted ver nice üòé

I am currently working, and it's incredible how much money I have been able to save up. After all of my bills, I am paying approximately $2200 CAD a month. Since everything is closed now, I'm spending around $1800. I have my own car and live alone in an apartment. 

Right now I'm just investing lots of my extra money into stocks.

dating,nw06se,2021-06-09 16:37:44,"Work on your insecurities before you get into a relationship. And on the flipside, don't date someone who is very insecure","I've noticed that my boyfriend always has a bad depression day whenever I so much as mention talking to someone else. I was texting my friend yesterday about *his upcoming wedding to another woman* and when I mentioned it to my bf he waited 10 minutes and then told me he was depressed. I also caught him going through my phone after I told him excitedly about one of my coworkers (who is a friend so I was happy for him) *getting engaged to his girlfriend of 7 years,* because he was concerned something was going on between us. We spend 24/7 together even NOT during quarantine, there is literally nothing more I can do to make him trust me. 

Other things he's done include deliberately asking questions or starting a story if I so much as start typing on my phone to keep my attention on him (he's admitted that he does this). I have other friends outside of him and it really sucks that I can't interact with them without it mentally affecting him. I can't even count the nights where I've sat in a dark room with him being quiet because he's depressed and ""can't"" move or speak. It's always on days when I'm happy too. If my depression is acting up, there never seem to be any issues on his side. I can't tell if it's manipulation, but something in the back of my head thinks it could be partially intentional on his side. 

I was so head over heels in love for the first year and a half, but honestly his lack of trust just triggered my past trauma responses and I don't think I am capable of trusting him anymore. Even if he's better I'm struggling to move past it. Don't get into a relationship when you have deep insecurities. It will destroy your relationship.



**Thank you everyone who posted advice!**

You've given me a lot to think about over the past few days. There were so many good ideas and new perspectives for me, I read every single comment. Someone suggested that I keep a list of everything that goes on, which reminded me of a pros and cons list I had started a couple years ago. I was able to read through the cons list with new eyes thanks to everyone's input! I had been minimizing it for such a long time, but it's true. It's all there. I thought that because he was quiet and didn't yell or get angry and often apologizes first after fights, that our relationship couldn't be toxic. I wrote down the big things and everything that just unsettled me a little and guys, my gut was right. Every. Single. Time. There are SO MANY instances of him turning stuff around on me.

Here's an actual entry from that list (at the end I write that I'm confused and **I WOULD HAVE NEVER FIGURED IT OUT WITHOUT EVERYONE'S HELP!**):

""bf called me a 'fucking idiot.' He did apologize, but he also made sure to tell me that sometimes he gets frustrated with my negativity (it was in response to a negative comment I made). I don't know how ok I am with him needing to justify calling me an idiot. It almost feels a little like pushing the blame onto me? I know it's him saying he's frustrated, but it felt like I caused it. Even if I am too negative, it's only a problem if it interferes with my life. If he has a problem with it he can bring it up in a serious discussion and tell me or he can leave. Wtf actually happened here.""

I'll post a real update when there's more to update on. But for now I wanted to thank you all for metaphorically slapping some sense into me!!","Try to look at your post/comments like your best friend posted it. It seems like you know exactly what you need to do but you‚Äôre allowing him to control the relationship. 


I know break ups are never fun or easy but you will feel so relieved once you‚Äôre out. This relationship  sounds like a lot more work than necessary"
dating,n4r8gf,2021-05-04 15:32:44,Guys who lovebomb for sex,"I want to understand why so many guys think it's ok to tell a girl all the things she might have wanted to hear from a man her entire fucking life just to get sex from her for one night. 

Recently hung out with a guy I've known for years. We have hooked up in the past but the last time I saw him it ended kind of awkwardly. Anyways, this guy is extremely attractive, very much my type, and I am very very attracted to him. 

The whole time we were hanging out he was lovebombing like nobody's business. Very early on he was making comments about us and things we would do as a couple. Kept sliding future plans/ideas into the conversation. When we were cuddling he called me ""babe"" and ""baby"" several times. He took my claddagh ring and flipped it around after I explained that flipping it around meant I wasn't single (a romantic fantasy I have). There was a point where he started listing adjectives of what he thought about me, and then stopped himself and said he needed to keep some to himself to text me with. He kept making all kinds of blatant comments to indicate future hang-outs. 

Even though I think he's really hot, I can't fully enjoy what he's saying because it doesn't feel true or real. I understand flirtation and I understand getting carried away with it. But this was different. It was like this guy had a secret checklist of ""how to get a girl into bed"" and was checking things off down the list to get to the ultimate goal of sex. 

It was pretty clear that he wanted sex from the fact that he kept trying to convince me to sleep over. I've never met a guy who asked me to sleep over and then didn't try to hookup. So I knew what was going on. I didn't stay and I'm glad I didn't, because I didn't hear a word from him the next day, and I'm sure I won't hear from him again any other day. 

Why do some guys think this is ok to do? Do they not realize the type of damage this can cause to a young woman's heart? Pretending you want a legit relationship with them, just to get sex for one night? That's absolutely horrible. If I were the younger version of me I would have spent all day yesterday crying when he didn't message me. But I'm wiser now after having had this happen to me twice or thrice already. 

What pisses me off even more is that this guy is supposedly going through a really hard time in his life, battling demons and thinking he might need to get help. I love how he didn't even consider how what he was doing to me (fooling me, pretending to like me) might put me in a bad place and worsen my depression. That's why I don't always feel bad for people who claim to be in such a bad place. My bad places don't cause me to believe my emotions are the only ones that matter so then I can go use some other person's body to make me feel better about my life. I understand the concept of ""hurt people hurt"" but I find it hard to believe this guy had no idea what he was doing. It seemed pre-meditated from the jump. 

I guess it turned into a rant. But I needed to say it. It's got me pretty gloomy today. Mostly because he just reinforced some beliefs of mine that nobody actually truly wants to be around me in life.

EDIT: please do not send messages to my inbox. especially saying things you can just say in a comment. if you disagree with the post, do it on the post. please don't invite me to chat.","I have a acquaintance that does exactly this, he has a series of steps and things to say to every girl .

I did want to add, as brought up by a couple of comments, that there are other ways of communication and showing interest even if you aren‚Äôt the greatest at messaging, the key is effort.

They matter. You might not be aware of how much they do all of the time but they show how much you care in simple and little ways and make the other person feel appreciated.

May it be a simple good night text. A kiss or heart emoji others might think are childish. A cute nickname you only use when you two are alone. Holding hands like you're still teenagers...

Whatever you do... Keep doing it.

You don't know how much it may mean to the other person, even tough it might seem like nothing much to you. And it might just break their heart a little if you just suddenly stop.

dating,hc1q2m,2020-06-19 14:32:14,This sub has become a cesspool of forever alone rhetoric,"Way too many posts and comments in this sub are trending into forever alone territory by people who are dying for others to join their pity party and give them affirmation that dating (especially online dating) is pointless if you are an ‚Äúaverage man‚Äù.

These people show up in practically every post and instantly try to shift the discussion toward them and how bad things are for men. Doesn‚Äôt matter if the post was written by a woman about a woman‚Äôs perspective on dating, these foreveralone types will always just marginalize their concerns and say ‚Äúbut what about men??‚Äù or ‚Äúbut men have it harder‚Äù.

* Dating is difficult for EVERYONE of both genders.

* Women don‚Äôt have it easy simply because there are a bunch of guys who want to have sex with them. In fact, those very guys are the reason WHY it‚Äôs difficult, because if you want a serious relationship you have to figure out who is serious and who is just pretending to be sincere to get in your pants

* Stanford University reported in a 2017 survey that online dating is the MOST POPULAR way for heterosexual couples to meet (39%). So the rhetoric that ‚Äúaverage men‚Äù have no chance in online dating is a delusion that guys use justify their bitterness. 

Dating is not easy and has never been easy. If you take some time to listen to, understand, and emphasize with the perspective of other people (especially women) instead of just drowning them out with ‚Äúwhat about men‚Äù, you will quickly realize that.","At the risk of inducing some additional ire, I‚Äôm going to mention that the people who are out there hitting home runs aren‚Äôt going to be on Reddit for hours discussing their dating issues.

I understand it can be taxing reading complaint after complaint about the plight of the average man on the dating scene. I should be the first person to stand up and say WTF, you guys don‚Äôt have it that bad, an ‚Äúaverage man‚Äù shot down my advances multiple times over the course of several months. I was 100% into him and made it very obvious. 

But I‚Äôm not going jump on that because dating is complicated and (as others have mentioned) very individualistic. Plus, when all your friends are having a good time meeting people and going out and you‚Äôre sitting at home on the weekends trying to figure out if you‚Äôre going to focus on laundry or cleaning bathrooms, you do feel sad and want to vent to others who can sympathize. I get that.

So I‚Äôm not judging. If I want to read the post, I will. If I don‚Äôt, I‚Äôll pass over it. I read your post and appreciate the sentiment although I do not share that perspective.

Happy Friday, everyone!!"
dating,13rb601,2023-05-25 07:41:44,He changed his mind after I deepthroated him,"



Hi all,

I am in a situationship with this guy. We have feelings, but a very different way of dealing with arguments/stress/frustrations. I like to talk things out. By doing this, he thinks I'm mad and he chooses to go silent. Problems don't get resolved this way obviously. This is also what holds us back from getting this deeper or to a real relationship.

Yesterday we had a good talk. He said he did think we should end this, because he didn't want me to get hurt. 

Well, we ended up having sex which he initiated. And I didn't know that I was able to do this, but I deepthroated him l. My gagreflex never really was ""sensitive"", but I didn't know I could go this far. I gave him my best blowjob ever and licked the life out of his balls.. and he went nuts. He fucked me >1h after that. 

Anyway, when we said goodbye he said that I needed to think about what I wanted. I said that his decision was clear, and I'm okay with it. He answered that he wasn't clear about his decision anymore.

I don't know, but after sex he apparently changed his mind?!?","Take that new found skill of yours and find a better man to share it with.  

Red flag number 1- i want to break up with you, now let's have sex. Kind of sounds like he used you."
dating,vmszzh,2022-06-28 17:43:09,does anyone else find online dating profile pics of men surrounded by a bunch of girls a turnoff?,"When I see a profile pic of just the one guy surrounded by a bunch of girls I kind of get turned off to be honest. I'm not here to see how many other girls want you, I want to know who YOU are. I've asked a guy friend about it and he claims women want men who are wanted by other women so those pictures show that.

Edit: Just wanna clarify I'm talking about photos where it's just the guy surrounded by girls in bikinis or something similar. Not just a guy chilling with his friends on a hike.

Edit 2: Now that I know that majority of comments here agree it's a turnoff. I kinda wanna know why guys who choose those photos think it's a good choice.","When it looks like they‚Äôre using the women as props to show off how adept they (supposedly) are at attracting women, it‚Äôs a huge turn-off."
dating,n3arnr,2021-05-02 17:01:52,Sometimes I wonder if this whole ‚Äústop looking for a relationship and it will happen‚Äù advice is just people trying to weed me out of the dating pool lol,"Everyones like I‚Äôve heard enough, you‚Äôre not wanted round these parts. I‚Äôll let you in on a little secret though. The kind of place you‚Äôre really looking for is actually very easy to get to, you just need to go 10,000 miles into the desert.

Then I look you in the eyes and nod, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre an honest and trusting soul to tell me that secret gem. I can tell that not many people know it exists. I‚Äôll leave right away. Good day.‚Äù

Then I die in the wasteland alone and no one has to deal with my shit anymore.","That and ""love yourself then someone will love you"" shit really grinds my gears."
dating,uz7o4l,2022-05-27 20:58:44,He told me my ass is too small,"I honestly don't know if this is the right place but I just feel awful about myself right now. I was on a date with this guy, he was walking me home then he casually mentioned that my ass is too small. It's literally my biggest insecurity. When he said that I couldn't believe it I paused and told him I'm not interested in talking to him anymore and that I thought he was very rude then I left. He kept calling my name and yelling sorry while I walked away, I ignored him. When I got home I saw his messages apologizing, I told him I'm not interested anymore and I don't want to pursue this then I blocked him then he tried to call me multiple times. I'm going to block his phone number as well but it just feels like shit to have your biggest insecurity confirmed by someone else. 

This is the first date I've been on after getting out of a 3 year relationship. My ex also made me feel awful about my body. I was trying to put myself out there but it just made me feel worse.","He was negging you. Obviously he was attracted, or he wouldn't keep calling after. You did the right thing though, block and delete. It's immature behavior."
dating,kl15yr,2020-12-27 09:56:20,Compliment your man,"Sure women are cute and beautiful but its also nice for men to sometimes get compliments about their physical appearance. Go tell the guys that matter to you what you like about their body! 
Most men would never ask for this but they equally enjoy hearing it. Even if they dont have a six pack!




Edit: whoa I guess that this blew up this much shows how much this matters to men.
Tell your partner the little things you like about them, dont worry about how to put it. Do you like their smile/arms/hair anything just say what you think.

And YES men should equally compliment and YES there is always shit people. I know. But there is also so many good people who should hear this more! 
Dont be afraid to compliment other men in your life too sometimes. A bit of kindness can make all the difference and change someones behaviour. Happy people dont hate.","My girlfriend recently told me I was handsome and I was completely frazzled. Being told compliments, especially by her, is one of the most emotional stirring experiences out there. 


To clarify, she's awesome and shows love and support for me 24/7. It's just rare to receive straight up compliments. From anybody."
dating,occj5z,2021-07-02 15:32:12,"This may be unpopular, but I am much happier being in a relationship than being single.","I‚Äôve seen the many, many platitudes of ‚Äúbe happy single‚Äù or ‚Äúfind interesting hobbies‚Äù and ‚Äújust improve yourself mentally and physically‚Äù all over this subreddit. I don‚Äôt disagree with any of them to be totally honest and have definitely pushed them on myself over the years to help with my loneliness. But ever since this past January when I met and started dating my current girlfriend, I have realized that I‚Äôm just happier being in a relationship than I am single. 

On weekends, I‚Äôd look for plans with friends, try to go to the bars, go down to the beach with family but it was always the same.. I wished I had someone to share my life with. I always wanted someone to try new restaurants with, go to the beach with, make memories with. I still did those things with friends and family, but it never quite hit the spot of doing it with a significant other. 

My confidence is up because my girlfriend compliments me, supports me when I have bad days, pushes me to better myself and now tells me she loves me whenever she can. These things just simply do not exist in the same way when you‚Äôre single. 

I know it‚Äôs not pretty, but the truth of the matter is that I‚Äôm simply happier having someone in my life than not, especially as the older I get (28M). 

I‚Äôm not sure where I‚Äôm going with this post, but I just want you to know that it‚Äôs OK to want a relationship to some degree to make you happy and if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre searching for, don‚Äôt let anyone tell you it‚Äôs not.","If we wouldn't be happier with a relationship I wouldn't see why we'd form relationships voluntarily.

And I can clearly see I'm better whilst in a relationship, even if she isn't around at that time. I'm more motivated to work, be social, take care of my home and take care of myself.

One might not strictly need a relationship, but it bringing benefits is the point."
dating,i5y0ms,2020-08-08 12:05:08,"I once hinted to a guy by buying him GTA V for $60 when it came out. He said thanks and then that was it. Please don't be like me and give subtle clues, always be direct.","It cost me a fortune. He had always been talking about the game and how he was excited for it. So a few days after it was released, I asked him if he'd bought it yet and he said ""still no"", so I went ahead bought the game for him thinking he would (a) realize I'm into him (b) become interested in me . It cost me $60 which was n awful lot, but I suppose that's how young and stupid I was.

Anyway, when I gave him the game, he was really really happy and even gave me a hug. He said thanks... and that was it. I would ask him how he's finding it and he would say it's awesome.

To this day i'm not even sure if he realized I was into him. But I don't think he was interested anyway; if he had been interested he probably would have hit me up afterwards, which he didn't. But then I realized I could have come to this conclusion much faster if i had just told him. So that's $60 down the drain. But I wasn't mad, I was quite happy that he was happy with the game. And I remember me showed he his progress on the game when i came over. So there's that.

But anyway my advice is just to be direct and don't spend money buying gifts. Tell them about how you feel and hopefully you will also get a direct answer from them",That guy had no idea. What were you like 16?
dating,mno8cn,2021-04-09 19:03:50,If they wanted to they would.,"Be. Okay. With. Being. Single. Seriously, I mean it. I‚Äôve been lead on, I‚Äôve been given mixed signals, not getting a text back, no second date when I thought things were going well. It sucked, and for a long time I thought something was wrong with me or something was wrong with them, but I realize human beings are incredibly fickle. 

Once I took the time to understand how people thought and put myself in their shoes, it‚Äôs helped me save so much time and energy that would‚Äôve been wasted to make something work. 

If they wanted to text you back, they would‚Äôve done it. If they wanted to ask you out, they would‚Äôve done it already. If they haven‚Äôt done it, then why are you waiting around for this person to do it? 

Wanting companionship is natural, instinct even. But if you‚Äôre seeking it so much that you have to sacrifice your mental and emotional happiness, it‚Äôs not worth it. I can‚Äôt guarantee your person will come, but please don‚Äôt wait on that person to reciprocate your feelings and find someone else who would. 

You‚Äôve communicated how you felt, they should be able to do the same back.","‚Äúwhen you look at someone through rose-colored glasses, all the red flags just look like flags‚Äù

dating,m6zdz1,2021-03-17 12:34:06,Why do people rarely look like their photos from the apps and think it's going to do them favours?,"EDIT: She got super needy all day when I was working and she sent me a really provocative pic with clevage saying ""you like? Shame about my face though I know"" and I told her not to be so self deprecating, and she told me if I didn't give her a compliment I'm not getting a second date so I told her what I thought and and I'm blocked hahaha 


I \[28M\] went on a walking date with someeone \[F23\] yesterday, her photos were very flattering, and not that it's important but she had a full body pic and she looked quite slender, busty etc, when I met her in person she was very overweight, and her face looked almost nothing like her pics, some very subtle similarities. She was good chat, good company, but after the date she asked me why I didn't kiss her goodbye, I reminded her that we are in lockdown and gotta be careful etc and she kept asking me if I found her attractive and I told her she has nice eyes and cool hair (still true!) then she said ""wow it's like pulling teeth trying to get compliments from you"" so I was honest I said ""I don't mean to sound rude but your instagram doesn't really reflect how you actually look"" and she basically confessed ""I very carefully take my photos to make myself look beautiful, it feels empowering"" like what the fuck? See I thought her sense of humour was great, good chat, but anyone else find it a huge red flag if they can't be honest with you on how they actually look?","I am actually attracted to larger people and I am a fat guy  myself but I will swipe left when I can tell someone is hiding their weight in pictures. The reason why is because I did date a couple girls that did that and their self esteem was awful, they were mean to themselves about their weight and even started projecting their internalized fatphobia on me. One of them even broke down every time I would exercise or make us a healthy meal. She would tell me all the time that I was only with her because I was fat and repulsive and if I lost weight I would ""upgrade"", which hurt me because not only did she admit she was only dating me as a last resort but she also did not think my feelings for her were genuine. Maybe not all people who edit their pic are like that but I am not risking that happening again."
dating,l9pfoj,2021-01-31 23:49:04,"If you‚Äôre in an open relationship, tell people before going on dates!!!","I went on a date last night with this guy from Tinder.

We talked about past relationships, and he spoke of his friend in a different town whom he met through tinder and kept in touch with. 

We went out for a drink last night, which turned into a walk, then a drive for some food. We ended up parking and chatting, and eventually fooling around in the back of his car. 
I was thinking ‚Äúwow this guy is super nice and sweet, I‚Äôd love to see where this goes‚Äù. 

Fast forward to this morning, he messages me and tells me that we‚Äôve met before.  Turns out we were at a mutual friend‚Äôs birthday party in December last year. He went with his GIRLFRIEND.

Anyway, if you‚Äôre in an open relationship that‚Äôs cool but be honest with your potentials!

dating,nlisbg,2021-05-26 14:46:52,"Since I always see the reverse, here‚Äôs some tips for ladies on making a dating app profile from a guy.","So I always see women giving advice to men and let‚Äôs be honest we are in serious need of it, but here‚Äôs some tips that I don‚Äôt think a lot of women know that may be depriving them of high quality matches.

* When selecting pictures of yourself, have at least 50% that do not have a filter on them.

Contrary to popular belief, a lot of men. Don‚Äôt just swipe indiscriminately. We look through all your pictures, and to a decent amount of us, not being able to see what you look like without a filter puts us off. I‚Äôm having a filter in some of them isn‚Äôt a big deal, however using a filter in 5 out of 7 of the pictures just doesn‚Äôt look good.

* On the topic of pictures, have 2 that we can see your body.

Guys want to know what we‚Äôre getting in to. If you only have picture of yourself from the neck up, we don‚Äôt know. To me at least, if you don‚Äôt show your body, it shows that either you‚Äôre hiding something or are a catfish, for all I know, you have 3 legs, webbed feet, and a tail. And heavier girls, please show that you are heavier, a lot of guys are super into it and some guys aren‚Äôt. Make yourself know to both, don‚Äôt waste your time matching with a guy that doesn‚Äôt like your body.

* In pictures, make sure we can easily tell who you are.

Having a picture to show you have friends is great, but don‚Äôt make all your pictures group pictures without any indication of who you are.

* HAVE A GOOD BIO

With the amount of women that talk about how men don‚Äôt have bios, some ladies are awful at bios. Bios in women are especially important because if you want a guy to give you a genuine opener that he doesn‚Äôt send to every other girl, we need to know something about you. Let us know a little about you so we‚Äôre don‚Äôt have to resort to crappy pick up lines and ‚Äúheyyy‚Äôs‚Äù.

* If you have dealbreakers list them.

This is going to be controversial. So I‚Äôm only 5‚Äô10, I know that to 70% of women I‚Äôll be too short. I‚Äôd much rather see that some girl wants a 6‚Äô+ guy on her profile and swipe left then have her stop responding after she asks my height. This applies to other dealbreakers. List them. Women and insecure men for some reason care when someone had their dealbreakers on their profile, honestly it just makes it easier for everyone. Now I‚Äôm not saying be mean, but if there‚Äôs something that you know you need your partner to have, or cannot deal with from a partner, let it be known so guys can just swipe left on you and you don‚Äôt have to waste any of your time and we don‚Äôt have to waste ours.

* The final tip I have is to diversify your pictures.

This is pretty simple, use different poses a different face look. It just kinda puts me off when all of a girl‚Äôs pictures have her doing the same pose with the same smile. I can‚Äôt really explain why but it just looks bad.

Hope this was helpful, I didn‚Äôt mean any offense to anyone.

Edited for clarity and grammar","This advice works for everyone.  The group photo is a major one.  Having to play a ""spot the difference puzzle game"" on every single one is annoying and uselessly time consuming. Good post."

Just like very chatty, smiley, eye contact, asking me questions etc. (love it when it‚Äôs clear the girl is making an effort and wants to be on the date. Not acting like it‚Äôs up to me to impress her, ask all the questions etc) so it‚Äôs going well and I‚Äôm a pretty introverted person in general but her being so extroverted I was thinking how could this girl ever like me and she‚Äôs probably just being nice, as that‚Äôs her personality. We were chatting a lot, laughing, getting along but It wasn‚Äôt really flirty chat so I couldn‚Äôt really tell if she was in to me. THEN! She excuses herself to go to the bathroom and when she comes back, instead of sitting back down in her seat across the table, she slides in beside me and oh my god it‚Äôs such a simple thing but I internally melted. Every date I‚Äôve been on it‚Äôs me trying to be a little forward to make it somewhat obvious that I like girl but for a girl to do this and make it clear shes into the date was just the sexiest thing ever.

The date went well, we ate lunch and went to an old record playing store, then walked around town looking at wall art- it was a great first date. 

We live in the same area and decided to hang out later at night for dinner at his place. I was comfortable around him so I agreed to go. I went back to my apartment for an hour then walked to his place. The dinner was nice, he was sweet and kind- nothing out of the ordinary. That is until his roommate arrived. 

Shes a nice girl, but it was weird that he invited her to join us to sit outside and join us. I didn‚Äôt mind her company but for a date I wouldn‚Äôt expect that. Within 10 minutes of her arriving I felt like a third wheel an hour in the conversation. When I would try to join in on the conversation he would make a rude remark like ‚Äúshe already said that, pay attention.‚Äù Or she would ignore my questions or say ‚Äúwe‚Äôre not children.‚Äù 

It felt so uncomfortable, I basically was interrupting their date (is what it felt like). I just got up, shook their hands said goodbye and left. I just needed to vent about this weird experience. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever see him again.

Much love to you all!","I feel like our generation is having issues because of a few things, and I could be wrong (so correct me). But I don't think you are that far off. And none may apply to you, just saying the issues. Our issues are:

1. People barely know how to communicate. Millions of questions on here relationship, relationship advice, and dating advice  asking for basic communication skills. And or making issues out of something they can easily talk to the person about.
2. Everyone is afraid of rejection much more than ever before, due to the millions of what if's social media has planted within their heads.
3. Men and women have generalized one another to the point everyone believes they have it harder dealing with the other gender, when truth is dating sucks for all.
4. Incels finally have a place to breed, and hate. Pity is no longer just that, it is explained in a hateful way that leads to people believing they will always be alone. And the fault is not of themselves, but the people they seek companionship with.
5. There are too many options, and nobody is willing to settle. 
6. People are aiming for people that will never be interested in them. It is a harsh reality, but bobby maybe you wife is jen the slightly overweight woman who loves everything you do. 
7. We are not patient.
8. We are entitled. We believe we deserve love, companionship, and a forever partner because we did things that are best for ourselves. But we still have't honestly looked inside and see if we will be right for another.
9. Lastly and biggest, we are spending too long getting ourselves stable. The house, the car, the successful career is so very hard to obtain. Due to the idiots before us whom created an environment where it is hard to grow. Therefore we are focusing so hard on those things the basic mental, emotions, and physical strength it takes to date we are too tired to do. We are depressed, we are tired, we are in debt, and we are poor. Finding a partner tends to come up for most when we aren't stressing about things that should be basic. And we are stressed most of the time. If you are asking where he is he is probably paying student debt and trying to get himself together first. LOL"

We were in bed after having sex and he kept asking me why I couldn‚Äôt finish by penetration.

He then proceeds to get defensive, walk out of bed, grab his phone from across the room and call his ex for ‚Äúproof‚Äù that she wasn‚Äôt faking it. Like literally right next to me in bed. His ex didn‚Äôt pick up and he played it off as a joke saying he would‚Äôve never actually asked her for that ‚Äúproof‚Äù if she had picked up. It was so weird I was kind of frozen and didn‚Äôt know what else to say so I pretended to fall asleep. Haven‚Äôt seen him now for two weeks and he wants to make plans but this has just given me major ick and insecure vibes. Thoughts??

dating,quj6gi,2021-11-15 15:40:03,4th date and still no kiss... is he nervous or not into me?,"UPDATE: i posted an update [here!](https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rc1zcm/update_4th_date_and_still_no_kiss_is_he_nervous/) spoiler alert, it was a success!

This is my (20F) first time dating as an adult. I met this guy (21M) through a friend, and he is wonderful. We have awesome chemistry on dates and I have a really good time with him. Only issue is, he hasn't made a move to do anything remotely physical with me. The most we've done is a little hand brush here or there, or a poke at the arm. My friends all think it's weird that he hasn't tried to kiss me, and I feel awkward making the first move.

Is this normal, or is he just not attracted to me?

Edit: to all of you calling me a hypocrite saying that i also haven't made a move, please note that this is my first shot at this and traditionally it is expected that the guy makes the first move. Obviously it's 2021 and times are changing, but I've never done this before and i don't know any women who have had to make the first move. Relax, i'm just nervous","On some real shit, as a guy, I would bet my whole bank account on the fact that he is just nervous. It‚Äôs anxiety inducing as hell to make the first move! He obviously likes you otherwise he wouldn‚Äôt have gone on 4 dates with you. Honestly, this just seems like a perfect opportunity for you to get out of your comfort zone and make the move if he won‚Äôt. You could be forward and be like ‚Äúso are you ever gonna kiss me?‚Äù Or you could just lean in and see if he gets the hint. If you want to kiss him, kiss him!"
dating,paz3x6,2021-08-24 23:34:53,FAQ - Where do you meet people?,"Hey everyone! I would like to put together a FAQ for the questions that are asked over and over again in this subreddit.

For those of you that have an easier time meeting people, tell us what works or worked for you. In your response please try to include as much information about your situation and your advice as possible. Helpful information can include:

1. your age, gender, location, sexual orientation, etc.
2. your usual hobbies, interests, etc.
3. who, what, where, when and how you meet people

Do apps work for you in your area? Did you use any paid dating sites? A dating or matchmaking service? Did you meet someone out and about? At a group event? Through friends or family? Let us know!","I am now a 28 year old straight male, located in Seattle, but I did my dating in the Atlanta area.

My hobbies include hiking, playing music, video games, taking care of aquariums, collecting coins, and things like that. 

Almost all of my dates were through dating apps, and primarily Tinder. I never paid for any, though I did have to reset my profile once because I had used some rough pictures and my profile got buried. I reset it with some much better quality pictures and my matches improved exponentially. After the reset I was on Tinder for about 3 weeks before I met the woman I eventually married. I couldn't be happier."
dating,pnjnae,2021-09-13 17:04:25,Guys who rate women out of 10,"27F here, just wondering how common this behaviour is.  


Matched with a 33M on Tinder, and one of the first things he said to me was wow didn't expect to match since you're an 8/10. I stupidly decided to let this slide as I thought he might be joking, or was perhaps nervous or a bit socially awkward and believed he was giving me a compliment. We had a lot in common and had some fun normal conversations over text so we decided to meet up after a week.

  
So this guy turned out to be very overweight, which was not shown in his pictures and was just wearing old casual clothes that didn't fit well. I was a bit upset because it was a somewhat fancy restaurant (his idea, and he told me to dress up), and I had spent a lot of time on my hair, dress and makeup. He again talked about me being out of his league. Again being fairly new to online dating I decided to give him a chance and see if we can still have chemistry in person. 

  
The date was going ok, conversation was flowing and I shared that I had an eating disorder in my teens when I was a track athlete. If it matters, I am still very fit and slim, though not underweight. This guy then decides to pull out his phone and show me an example of a girl who is a ""10"" with a perfect body, and it was a nude pic.

  
I cut the date short and left. He's since been blowing up my phone about how he's just honest, that the x/10 thing is just how guys think, that he was trying to ""help"" me feel better about myself and that I should stop being so insecure and shallow. I mean I can see that some guys are more physically my type than others, but I have never thought about rating them out of 10 and don't know anyone else who does this.   


Is this a form of ""negging""? Have any of you ladies (and gents) experienced this?","it is absolute psycho behavior to share this with someone else, let alone a girl you are on a date with. Not sure how people can be so socially awkward, but i can't even imagine doing something close to this.   


yes, everyone judges everyone, its natural. how good looking you are, etc etc.. but its not something you share, and you obviously dont then compare her to what girls you think are better looking than her.  


0% chance he has ever had a girlfriend, i suggest you don't be his first. good luck though"
dating,ns6s61,2021-06-04 14:43:35,Update: Girl told me about her FWB on our first date - WHAT?,"Original thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/npt0ue/girl_told_me_about_her_fwb_on_our_first_date_what/

I received a *plethora* of good advice. The loose consensus was to let her know I was uncomfortable with it. We ended up having a surprisingly lengthy discussion. Her intention was to continue the conversation, but also to be upfront and honest about having a fwb. She admitted it probably came across as tactless. I would've preferred not to know as I assume people are dating others until exclusivity, plus I only want to discuss sexual exclusivity when it becomes relevant. The problem's that her fwb was brought up straight away, which forced me to find out if she'd be looking to be exclusive with the right person in the future. She said she would, but wasn't going to give up a recently formed arrangement, particularly for someone she's just met. I agreed it's way too early for me to ask much of anything at this point and I wasn't going to. 

She's being intimate with someone in ways - physically and (to a degree) emotionally - that I'd be looking to ultimately share with someone exclusively. It's not just dating others - It's a sexual relationship. I'm sexually monogamous; proceeding knowing she's sleeping with someone compromises on my personal boundaries too much. It's too conflicting and difficult to get emotionally invested knowing she's having sex with someone as I'm getting to know her. it's also not fair for either of us for me to have a barrier up until she potentially ends that.

I voiced these thoughts. Her messages back were long, thoughtful, honest, and notably trying to reassure me. She also tried to reassure me further by saying she might not see him for 1-2 months. Honestly, that helped a little, but the principle remained the same - she still wants that arrangement. Ultimately we reached a stalemate - there'd be no way to proceed we'd both be happy with. We've called it off for now, but agreed to stay in touch.

I don't feel like I gained anything, but just lost something. I feel down about it.

Edit: thank you for all of the advice across both threads, it's been hugely valuable for helping me consolidate my thoughts and even for articulating my own positions more succinctly. I read all of them and appreciate the feedback.",Well. At least you both handled this with open and honest communication and maturity.
dating,nmyw7m,2021-05-28 14:21:20,Stop using others as an emotional buffer while you recover from your last relationship.,"Dating someone who isn't over their ex is like taking on someone elses credit card debt. You enter a relationship with someone who is still ""paying off"" a significant amount of energy and pain and you both aren't starting fresh from a zero balance. It's a very miserable start. For the partner, it feels like a massive burden to have to listen to the negative stories and comparisons and light comments about someone they don't even know. Even if those comments are meant to paint the current partner in a better light AKA ""you do xyz, my ex never wanted to do that"".

We all have history, we all mention our past partners a few times... but mentioning it constantly and linking it to everything you do or talk about will absolutely kill the potential. When you start a new relationship it should be a fresh start, and its up to you to make sure your view on this new relationship isn't clouded by feelings from the past. Sure, you might never go back to your ex, or they might make you angry every time you think about them... but that's still mental and emotional energy being expended in areas that could otherwise be spent more productively. Your partner will feel this vacancy, and they will grow distant and disappointed the more it occurs.

Make sure you are wholehearted before bringing someone new into your life. Otherwise you will actively contribute to the vicious cycle of emotional unavailability by making someone else feel as unhappy and unworthy as you had once felt with your last partner.",Raise your hand if you've ever been used as a therapist by someone who wasn't over their last relationship üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I confronted her and she refused to discuss it.  I was supposed to visit her this weekend and was halfway there when she texted me that she had to grocery shopping and do other personal things tommorow so I should turn around.  

Frustrated I broke up with her over text in response to that text and she immediately called and started begging for me to come and she was actually free and was just depressed at the moment.  I told her I was going to have to think about it but i was really frustrated and if she wants to see me she can drive her ass to my place cuz im done wasting my time.

dating,kizijd,2020-12-23 19:29:12,Not interested anymore? Please just say so.,"I went on (what I thought) was a phenomenal first date 2 weekends ago. It was fun, easy, we laughed a lot, and he even said he wanted to check his schedule so we could plan another this week. 

Then, he ghosts. No follow up, no reply to my one follow up text, nothing. Nada. Gone. 

Here's the thing. I can only assume people are afraid to be honest due to getting bad reactions in the past. I get that. I'm not asking for you to tell me in person, as I know that can get awkward and maybe you've had someone flip out. I don't know, but I respect your reservations. 

HOWEVER. Please do not say you want to plan another date if you have no intention of actually doing so. A follow up text of ""Hey, I had a good time (if that's true), but I'm not interested in moving forward."" Is better than just ghosting after 1) getting my hopes up and 2) making me feel like you actually liked me enough to date me. 

It's hurtful, confusing, and just annoying. 

If you aren't mature enough to just BE HONEST, maybe you shouldn't be dating. Rejection hurts, but being told you want to go on a second date when you actually don't hurts worse & makes dating more shitty than it already is.

Edit: I did NOT expect for this to cause such a big discussion. I'm trying to read through as many comments as I can, and I hope those of you that have felt/are feeling this kinda pain (or worse!) are doing alright during the holidays. :/ I'm deeply sorry for the hurt any of you have experienced.

Edit: I really appreciate the genuine, kind comments that I've seen here that actually understand this point of view and can feel empathy for it. Or the people engaging in pizza roll discussion, don't hate on the rolls man!","The reason you're single is because you cook your pizza rolls in the goddamned microwave instead of the oven like a civilized human being. /s

But no, I 100% get what you're saying, and am basically in the exact same boat. 27 year old guy, never had a girlfriend, never so much as kissed someone. So if it matters I can relate to some extent.

I think a lot of the people who try to convince others that being single is awesome have had (or are in) some sort of romantic relationship. It's a completely different mindset than having been alone your whole life. It's one thing to be single for a few months, or even a year or two. Not having had any romantic connections with another person your whole life is a completely different kettle of fish, and can put you into some seriously dark places at times."
dating,ekz30l,2020-01-06 19:41:53,The bar is at the fooking FLOOR,"I'm a below average/average dude, but I'm always shocked at how basic manners are seen as acts of kindness whenever I go on a date. 

I recently went on a date with a girl, and I told her she looked really good. She instantly lit up and said that she's NEVER had someone tell her that before on a date. I'm like wtf. Man that's a bit sad because I felt like she was a good-looking person and I thought it was a polite thing to say. 

On another occasion, I was watching Big Mouth with a date and there was a scene where this dude tries to push a girl's head towards his crouch, indicating that he wanted oral sex. She told me about how that's happened to her a few times on a date, and again, I'm like wtf; that's rude af. 

I don't know man. My ex girlfriend a couple of years told me that I was the only person who treated her right, but nothing about me is special--nor romantic.

Ultimately, I guess what I'm trying to say is that the bar is at the fooking FLOOR.","Here's a really pathetic story:

I was driving for Uber/Lyft a few years ago and I picked up a couple from the bar district in my city. It was about 1:30-2am and I was taking them back to the guy's place. About 5 minutes into the 20 minute trip the guy says loudly ""Oh, no. I paid for dinner and took you out for drinks. I don't care if this is our first date, we ARE having sex."" Seriously? Who TF does that?

I stopped my car, told him to get the fuck out, cancelled the ride and took her back to her place for free. She sobbed the entire time.

EDIT: Thank you so much for the updoots and SILVER. I just did what any father would do. She could've been my daughter and if he were my son I would've beat the shit out of him.

dating,g848rk,2020-04-26 00:02:13,This is what I've learned from my previous relationship,"Everyone says that every relationship that you have, either a good or a bad one, teaches you a lesson. However, it is easier said than done. We often think about how much we suffered, or how we wish we would've done things differently. Tonight, I stopped for a second, distanced myself from all the pain that I've been feeling, and made a list about everything that my previous 3 year old relationship has taught me. I hope you like, and feel free to share your thoughts! Here it is:

1. Love does not overcome everything. It takes a lot more than just loving someone, in order to make a relationship work.

2. You can love someone to death and still not wanting that person to be in your life ever again.

3. Respect is actually more important than trust. Let me explain. You can lie to someone and gain their trust again, even though it is hard (and it definitely depends on how much you ruined someone else's trust), but once you lose respect about someone else, it's almost impossible to respect them again. I mean, you can try, but in the long run, it will be a problem again.

4. Don't overlook the red flags. This happens mostly in the beginning of every relationship, you're so drunk in love with your partner that you try to brush off every red flag that you come across. Don't do it. It will only get worse over time.

5. If you're in a relationship, both of you will make time for each other, and neither of you will have to ask for it. Once you do, and you feel bad for asking your partner to do so, something's wrong.

6. Always be aware of the way that person treats their parents (especially their mom). They won't treat you any better than that. (obviously, I'm not referring to toxic family dynamics, that's a whole different thing). 

7. Both of you can change throughout the relationship, and grow together as one. But, don't expect someone to change really rooted patterns. It will only hurt you, and your partner.

8. If you breakup with your SO, and he/she says ""I'll change for you"", don't give him/her another chance. Not only they won't change, but they should want to change for THEMSELVES, regardless of the outcome of your relationship.

9. Communication is the key to everything. If you're willing to talk things out and your partner is always trying to brush it off with a silly apology, your problems will only grow until they become unbearable.

10. Love yourself more than anyone else. If you don't, you'll become submissive and you'll lose your identity throughout the course of your relationship. You'll become more and more dependent on your partner, and it'll be a hundred times harder to say ""enough is enough"".

11. I believe in second chances. But you shouldn't give more than that. Once you do, they think you'll never leave and it'll only get worse.

12. Besides cheating, there are wounds that can never be healed. When you find yourself thinking about getting back with your ex, think about everything that has been said or done, and if you could look at that person differently. 
If not, then don't go back. You may miss that person, you may still love him/her, but sometimes, there's just too much damage.","shit bro, I loved it!"

dating,m5qk4k,2021-03-15 17:55:03,"i've been ghosted before, but NOT this bad","This happened about a year ago but I just have to share this experience cause I still cannot believe to this day that someone can do this to someone else.

I (then 24F) met a guy (23? M)  on Hinge and instantly hit it off. I have a dog and so does he, so our first date we went to the dog park with our dogs. The first red flag was that our dogs didnt get along (both males, mine is nuetured but his wasnt so I think thats why). We brought wine in mugs and stayed at the dog park til sunset. We went over to my house after (the dogs started getting along) and watched a movie! He pulled a move and we start making out and he tries to go for more but I said no cause this was the first time meeting and he was fine with that. 

The next time we hung out we went out to eat together and had a great time. I caved in and slept with him after cause things were going SO well.  He even picked me up from work a few days later which was super nice cause I was bartending and got out around midnight and I hate taking the train home that late or paying for an expensive Uber.

We made more plans to hangout, he was gonna pick me up from work on Friday night, sleep over, and then we were gonna go out for a hike with the dogs on Saturday. I told him I would be out of work at 11:30pm. We were texting through out my shift and things seemed normal. 11:30pm comes and I'm outside the bar waiting for him. He texted me saying ""almost there"" and then a few minutes ""here"". He was no where. I called him, no answer. I texted him, no answer. Called him again, no answer. So I start thinking oh maybe he got pulled over or something. 12pm comes and hes still not here like he said. I knew what his car looked like and he knew where my bar was located cause he's picked me up before. I ended up just ubering home cause I wasn't gonna wait around in the middle of the city at midnight. I called him again when I got home and no answer.

So here I am thinking something happened to him but I feel bad blowing up his phone cause I dont wanna be annoying but like what the actual fuck dude. I never heard from him at all Saturday but I saw he was on snapchat and posted to his IG story. I ended up messaging him on Sunday saying how hurt I was and how disrespectful that is to do to someone. He responded with ""I'm not doing this anymore, please stop contacting me"" which I completely did not understand but I'm not gonna waste my effort on someone who doesnt want to talk to me.

That was the last I heard of him. Fast forward to now, I'm in a happy and healthy relationship with the love of my life(28M). Apparently he still follows me on IG cause a few weeks ago he messaged me apologizing and wanted to explain what happened. I told him thank you for apologizing but I dont need an explanation cause its in the past and am over it now. He then said ""so it looks like youre not single anymore?"" i replied ""yes i'm dating someone now!"" and he claimed he was jealous but ""good luck"". I told him he had his chance he then he said ""well give me another"". I literally LAUGHED OUT LOUD and said no.

It's really funny to think back on this now cause its like, how does someone even DO that to someone else???? We all have our demons and deal with our own shit, but you should still have some respect for others. People can't read your mind. Communication is key. It was so discouraging at the time, I kept wondering what I did wrong or what I couldve done more or less of. I realized (after a long time) I wasnt the problem, he was.

So to any of you who are soooo over dating and being ghosted and disrespected, HANG IN THERE! Obviously easier said than done but your time will come for love.",The whole ‚Äúhere‚Äù thing is hecka weird. Why lie they were driving and then there...weeeird.

I have been periodically stealing water cups from this restaurant since I‚Äôm a bit of a kleptomaniac but I sacrificed my horde to make this date extra fun.

Not my ideal first date (or any date for that matter) but I decided to go because I‚Äôve been working for days straight plus it was my only day off before going into work tomorrow. So we agreed and he told me to bring a friend because his friend was coming. My response: Okay? So I brought a good friend of mine.

We both showed up to one of the bars that was also a club and I already wasn‚Äôt enjoying the atmosphere. So tinder guy and his friend briefly greet us then continue to drink and dance amongst themselves as if me and my friend weren‚Äôt present. Every woman that walked passed them they would make eye contact and would try to scope them out- really uncomfortable feeling. Yet somehow every guy that approached me and my friend tinder dude and HIS friend would notice we existed, get defensive and ask the guy to join us? 

Then it got to point where my date just plain out approached a group of girls and started flirting with them right in front of me and when I approached him about it he said ‚Äúidk why you‚Äôre getting bent out of shape for we were just having a basic conversation and you and your friend bring negative energy.‚Äù 

As much as I wanted to punch him in the throat, I don‚Äôt like to resort to violence and just turned around and left. Mind you, this date lasted 45 minutes. By far, the worst date I‚Äôve ever gone on in my life and complete waste of time.

EDIT: Wow, didn‚Äôt know I‚Äôd get responses from this- I just really needed to vent b/c I felt so disrespected and had no one else to talk to about it! Lesson learned, though. Btw, I blocked him immediately after I left and laughed about it with my friend. Not worth it!","As a guy, sounds like he just wanted to go out to the clubs to try and get laid and figured he‚Äôd invite you as an ‚Äúoption‚Äù and to also show off to someone? That he ‚Äúhad‚Äù multiple girls with him."

dating,pv6y16,2021-09-25 13:39:13,Women should ask men out,"Alot of times I see women say they are into a guy but alot of times they will miss out on him because they won't ask him out and I have seen the same 3 things said the man should ask the woman out they're scared of getting rejected or if he's interested he will ask.

Advice here alot of men are as dense as as forged steel so you can give us hints all day long and we will never know. Some men such as myself can be shy nervous and or just have complete social anxiety that renders us from trying to function in social settings. And fear of rejection alot of us men face that every time we see women some men don't have the confidence other men have due to being constantly rejected so sometimes making the first move goes a long way. 

Issue I do see society wants new standards but still want to live by old customs it can't work like that anymore. Sometimes you gotta take ambition into your own hands and make the first move ladies","The problem is that many guys are so starved of attention that they will say yes, even if they are not interested in the girl at all and wouldn‚Äôt have bothered to ask her out themselves.

I haven't met anyone besides my ex-fiancee who would ask me about me. But now, I can ask 50 questions, bring up whatever topic, and my dates don't reciprocate. I genuinely don't understand why and it's killed any romantic drive I have.

Is it really too much to be wanted like that?","The short answer is no.

The longer answer is this: You seem to take action and initiative in dating. This is all good and well, but when someone does not reciprocate, you blame it on yourself. 

Maybe you can shift the way you look at it. See the ""being interested in your person"" as a kind of baseline. Any person who is not interested would not have worked out with you eventually."

It's a good job but the only downfall is that he's going to be away a LOT. He'll basically only be back on weekends.

 He starts on Monday, but he just made it very clear that if I don't like it or if I feel it's affecting our relationship to tell him and he will quit immediately.

He said the last thing be wants to do is fuck up what we have, and just his willingness really hit different. Sorry, just wanted to gush

Edited to add:
I see the points people are making, and I should have been more clear. First I guess I shouldn't have said ""immediately"", because he said he's going to try it out for at least a month, and I wouldn't even try to ask him to quit without trying it out for a good while first.

Also, this was never going to be a career for him anyway. It's doing roofing just for the summer with a friend of his. Just until he figures out what he would like to do more permanently. It was the quickest job he could start to get out of his other one.

One commenter put it pretty well I think, that my boyfriend and I prioritize more time together than some people. It's not for everyone but I'm glad it works for both of us. And obviously not everyone even has that opportunity, like the nurse in the comments who hasn't been able to see her boyfriend since covid started, due to him having an immunocompromised son.

Hey all,

I've not been great at dating and the times I have dated I've always been the one asking. But I went back on the Bumble dating app for another try recently as I like the idea of the woman having to send the first message. I only got one match but we struck a conversation immediately. we moved on to Whatsapp and last night she asked me to meet up for coffee. I'm so excited :D

Whether or not this works out, I still feel incredibly happy that someone actually asked me out for once!

Then it went downhill. He was always late hours dates, his stories always changed, and I couldn‚Äôt trust him. I wanted to, and I‚Äôd make excuses, but I couldn‚Äôt do it. I decided to remove myself from the situation. 

Over the past few years, I‚Äôve always compared everyone I‚Äôve met to him - to the butterflies I felt. No one has ever compared. 

He texted me about a month ago, but because of Covid we haven‚Äôt been able to align our schedules. We finally set a date for tomorrow night, and when I texted to confirm, he said he‚Äôd be available after 10:30pm, but he‚Äôd still really like to see me. 

All the butterflies are gone. He‚Äôs not who I had imagined him to be, and I‚Äôve decided not to go on the date. I texted him my decision 5 hours ago and haven‚Äôt heard back. I‚Äôve been feeling lonely lately because of Covid, but I‚Äôve decided I‚Äôd rather be lonely than treated unwell.

Find domestic violence resource centers in your area or online, such as the National Domestic Violence Hotline in the US. I am sure there are reddit help groups also.

dating,nkcjma,2021-05-25 00:25:23,Does anyone else feel in retrospect that they loved their ex more as a fantasy than an actual person?,"I talked to two of my exes recently on the phone, we had really nice chats both and I'm no longer really into either (a bit, but not too much), but with one it hit me that, despite the fact this relationship seemed so intense and full of being ""in love"" at the time, I don't particularly respect her, I've never really deeply cared about what happens in her life apart from me the way I do friends and family, and that I don't really like her that much as a person. In retrospect, so much of my ""passion"" for her was the fact that she was really good looking and that I felt she was out of my league and I had this fantasy that somehow she would be the end of insecurities and boredom in my life.

The other ex I talked to and I realized, now that I'm over her, I really love her as a friend. She's such a wonderful, empathic, incredibly sensitive and intelligent and real person I can almost see more clearly now that it's not a romantic thing. It's crazy the illusions being in a passionate relationship give us about who we're with when our need for love and affirmation distorts obvious realities. The ancient greeks had it so right that sexual/romantic love (eros) can't compete with deep friendship (philia). When you're no longer into someone and get back down to earth you really see how someone's moral fiber, intelligence, and empathy are so much more important than their looks or surface charm.",[deleted]
dating,lcnrwe,2021-02-04 19:28:09,I DID IT! I cut him off after ignoring red flags and lowering my standards for him. I deserve better.,"I (19F) was dating with this guy (24M) for the whole 6 months, we are not in any official relationship. 
We rarely met as I live 80kms away. But I did not mind travelling in the middle of the pandemic just to see him (hoping it will work somehow), and I've done it 5 times. but would he do the otherwise? NOPE.

Let me list down his red flags I tried to ignore the whole time:

‚Ä¢ Constantly talking about his ex, praising her like goddess, kept talking about how amazing their sex was, comparing me with her. When I confronted him, he told me ""I had moved on, don't worry, trust me"". (i.e. his ex is a freelance, and is into stocks, money investing and financial stuff just like him, meanwhile I'm just way too busy with uni I don't have time for anything like that yet. He doesnt like that about me, wishing I could be like her. HELL NO).

‚Ä¢ Taking me to places he used to visit with his ex. I was okay with it because if I wasn't we weren't gonna meet. Sigh stupid me.

‚Ä¢ Would not accept the fact that I have anxiety and depression and is on medication, but he thought it will be ""too difficult for him to handle if one day I have rebounds, I need to be independent"". As if I can't take care of myself because of my mental issues.

‚Ä¢ Thought that I was overreacting when I told him I was once suicidal.

‚Ä¢ He DOES NOT want to visit me, he only wanted to be visited. Let me make it clear, he DOES NOT want to. I'm okay if he can't do it, but he doesn't even want to. He thinks my place is unfamiliar.

‚Ä¢ He hates people who cry, and I'm quite sensitive. I cry when I'm stressed out, he thinks I'm weak and undermining my problems.

‚Ä¢ Has anger issues and thinks getting angry is much better than crying because it makes you seem stronger.

‚Ä¢ Saying I'm not following the health protocols seriously because I don't bring a spare mask when meeting him, and he thinks that's on being ""dependant"" (I mean he said he prepared one for me though), while he always asked me to go on a date with him as if that is not against the health protocols.

‚Ä¢ Wishing I would change for him, so I said you are nobody for me and even unsure about getting serious with me, so why would I change.

‚Ä¢ He had never asked about my day. EVER. In the whole 6 months of talking to each other.

‚Ä¢ Is a bit rude to waiters and new people.

‚Ä¢ Lastly, he is waaay too comfortable in his comfort zone and not willing to open up for new things.

Feb 2 I finally cut him off through phone call saying I'm too tired of these nonsense and mentioned all of his red flags. I feel so relieved.
I did not regret a thing, if anything it would be the fact that I lowered my standards for him.

edit: some typos and adding a thing i just remembered

dating,ebr1nv,2019-12-17 04:45:03,From experience: Mixed Signals are almost always no intention of actually pursuing a relationship/date. Mixed signals are usually ‚ÄúI like the attention you are giving me‚Äù and that‚Äôs it.,"I am 35 (male) and I wish I had learnt this years ago. Really ‚Äúlearn it‚Äù not just know it. 

In my experience about 99% of the times someone throws you constant curve balls that just means they are playing with you. They are not being mean, their brains deceive them into thinking you know what they are doing. 

Learn this: Even when someone texts you randomly at night, or they go out with you but remain at arms distance, or say nice things about how good they feel around you, BUT won‚Äôt become romantic, they are just using your attention.

Become romantic means actively seeking or agreeing to be alone with you at night. Feeling confortable with being alone with you. Seeking or allowing touching and lingering of such touch. Obviously kissing and holding hands. 

Romantic doesn‚Äôt mean telling you their secrets. Constant texting. Non flirtatious compliments like ‚Äúyou are sweet‚Äù or ‚Äúyou make me happy‚Äù. Asking you out on things they want to do but no one would do with them...

Curve balls also include texting you but then leave you hanging when you ask for a date and then changing the subject. Telling you about how awesome you are but then dating someone else. Going out with you, **constantly allowing you to pay** but then telling you they have an early morning and then you seeing in their social media they continued the night somewhere else.

Attraction is almost instant in most cases, if someone wants to feel you and touch you they will soon enough. Don‚Äôt waste a lot if time waiting for it to happen. If someone is throwing you curve balls just move on.

Good luck.","Great post. And if you don't mind I'll just go ahead and TLDR it by throwing in one of the most important dating mantras out there; If she likes you, you'll know. If she doesn't like you, you'll be confused.

These guys usually start off with a hidden agenda e.g. they're not over their ex and are looking for someone to tide over the gap so they don't have to face their emotions, or they were never looking for a relationship with anyone - and no, if they like you a lot but they truly don't want a relationship, you won't be able to change their mind. I actually take it as a compliment when a guy spends a load of time with me then calls it off, it means he did really like hanging out with you but he realised you probably wanted more & he just cannot give that to anyone at this time. It's almost like.. he couldn't help himself but keep seeing you and you weren't easy to cut off, it's just that he's not looking for something serious, so he had no choice at the 3 month mark."

dating,k0w9a1,2020-11-25 17:16:21,To all the people who have never been in love/a relationship...,"Hi everyone! 


I've been seeing a lot of posts recently about never having been able to find a SO/being forever single/getting to some age where you feel like you've failed because you've never been in love etc. etc. and I just want to send out some love and virtual hugs to all of you. So often (and especially because of the pandemic) we feel useless and unworthy of love because we've never been able to find someone to experience romantic love with. I wanted to reach out to you and tell you that I know you feel alone and that that will never change, but **you are not alone**. There are so many of us with you.


I (F26) have also never had a relationship. I've never been in love, never spent more than a couple months talking to a guy, and I *constantly* struggle with feeling unworthy of love and as if I'll be alone forever, especially as I watch all my close friends and family couple up. I've always struggled with poor self-image, being extremely hard on myself, and body dysmorphia my whole life (I've always been on the chubbier side), and I conditioned myself into believing that nobody would ever love me or feel attracted to me because of my weight (even when my friends tell me that I don't look the way I think I do). I would always get so jealous of women who I felt were either similarly attractive or less attractive than I was who were able to get boyfriends and I wondered why nobody took a chance on me when all of these other girls had no problem getting guys. And then I realized. **I'm the problem**. My shitty self perception is what's killing my chances at love. No amount of fake confidence and outgoing personality is going to cover up the fact that I don't like the way that I look.


I'm not putting this out there to tell you to do self-exploration or to tell you what you need to do to find someone who will love you because I haven't figured that out yet for myself. What I *am* trying to do is offer you some words of love and encouragement because we are feeling more alone than ever right now, and many of us are constantly getting *bombarded* with social media posts of people getting engaged/married/moving in together (which is very strange in itself).


* Social media is **not** real life. People are flexing right now on social media because we're all alone and depressed in one way or another and social media is the only way that people are getting validation. Just because you see everyone and their dog getting engaged doesn't mean that they are actually happy in their relationship (not saying that people aren't, but people get engaged for a *lot* of reasons). If this is giving you a lot of anxiety, **delete Instagram**. Even if it's just for a month. It's a wonder how being away from social media makes it easier for you to spot bullshit when you come back. 


* I heard this in a podcast with Patti Stanger (the Millionaire Matchmaker!! LOL!) and she was talking about this millionaire guy who she couldn't match up. She said: ""Sometimes in life, it takes a long time for your number to come up in the love lottery. It doesn't mean that it won't ever come up, but for some people it takes longer than others"". That really resonated with me because I spend a lot of time blaming myself for not being able to find someone, but in reality it's a numbers game at the end of the day. My number will come up eventually, **and so will yours**. 


* A lot of us struggle with internal/external pressure from family, our biological clocks, etc. I have this secret plan in the back of my mind that I'll get married by 30, have kids before 35, and then go on with my picture-perfect life because that's what my parents would want and what I want for myself. I had to (with the help of my therapist) accept that that's **not** reality. Life doesn't go as planned. No amount of hope or expectations is going to magically manifest itself into a perfect relationship, **and that's okay**. Please don't feel as if you're failing because of the expectations you have. Think to yourself - *why* do I have these expectations? Translate them to another situation (e.g. My parents want me to be good at math, so I'm going to magically be good at math and win the Nobel prize). When's the last time that's worked? Do you have the expectations for the right reasons, or because you think that you're going to lose marks on your life score card because you haven't gotten to X/Y goal by a certain age?


A lot of points here, but the most important thing I want you to hear from this is that **it's okay to be alone and unlucky in love**. You're not fucked up. You're not alone forever. We have to keep in mind that in this digital age more and more people are alone (and we're obviously not posting about it on social media unlike our couple friends), and dating apps haven't made that any better. Everything is so magnified right now, and I just want to hug you all and tell you **we're in this together**. 


And if you're like me and struggle with self confidence, just remember what the great saviour RuPaul tells us: ""If you can't love yourself, how in the hell are you going to love somebody else?""


**EDIT:** Wow. Guys. I'm floored by the love and support from everyone here. I wrote this in hopes of getting to a couple people who are feeling down and went about my workday as usual. Thank you so much to everyone for all the awards (my first awards ever on Reddit!). I'm going to try my best to respond to as many comments and messages as I can, but I just wanted to reiterate that the point of this post is to tell people who've been feeling alone and isolated for a long time that **it's okay to be alone. It's okay to be single right now, it's okay to have been single your whole life, and it's okay to be single forever if that's what happens. You are still a person who is worthy of love even if you don't feel that way, and there are a lot of great things that you bring to the table that you haven't discovered about yourself yet.** I always feel as if people are looking down on me for not being able to find love or be in a successful relationship, and I wanted to spread the love to people who feel the same way. 


I'm still learning this and trying to apply it, but a positive mindset can be one of the most attractive things about a person. If you don't feel like you're worthy of love, this may translate into your actions when you're trying to date and get to know someone better. I've heard *so* many times that nothing is unsexier than someone who can't find anything nice to say about themselves. If this is something you struggle with, my only recommendation is to seek a professional who can help you work through your mental and emotional obstacles (that's what I'm doing!).


That being said, the reason I included that story about myself wasn't to solicit advice about my weight or appearance or things I need to change about myself to get a boyfriend. I wanted to share my vulnerabilities so that the people who are in my situation could relate (because sometimes, the last thing we want to hear is advice from people who are happily coupled up). I wish the best of luck to everyone here (single or not!), and **many hugs** to everyone regardless of whether or not they agree with me.","Thanks for this post, really needed it today :) F28 & in the same boat. It‚Äôs like, I know I‚Äôm not hideous but I know I‚Äôm (looks and personality-wise) not everyone‚Äôs cup of tea, but I‚Äôve got to be SOMEONE‚ÄôS, right? Would rather just have a little faith that it *might* happen than try to deal with or force a square peg/round hole situation. Best of luck to you <3"

dating,gwlctn,2020-06-04 16:59:06,One of the most attractive things in a man...,"...is the ability to run his own household. Honestly, I‚Äòve dated all types of men.

There was the one guy who was very sweet and kind but came from a Greek island so had been raised by the stereotypical Greek mum. One of his uncles had lived with my date‚Äòs grandmother until the day this uncle married his wife. And his wife was only deemed acceptable after her cooking had been tasted. This uncle never had to cook his own meals in his life. My date had been culinarily spoilt by his loving mum as well which led to him somehow thinking that it was sufficient for himself to put onions, Frankfurter sausages and ketchup in a sauce pan to make pasta sauce.

Then there was the guy who was great at cooking but never ever bothered with tidying up. It was so stressful. I am not the tidiest of people but every 10 days to two weeks I‚Äòll give my flat a proper tidy and clean up. I clean my bathroom weekly and my wee vacuum robot vacuums every other day. But this guy‚Äòs flat and house were just...they looked like he‚Äòd just moved in, several years after he had. 

Then there were the guys who could neither cook nor clean, one‚Äôd keep plastic cups full of put-out cigarettes around for ages before throwing them out and always order in or eat out. One‚Äòd have months worth of fizzy pop plastic bottles piling up (in Germany we get cash for them, so returning them to the supermarket is actually great!). 

And finally, I dated one guy who was actually able to look after himself. He meal-prepped every Sunday: veggies usually with chicken breast or other healthy meats, or pasta or more or less anything. He‚Äòd cook all his own food, clean and tidy his place to a decent normal level, wash and iron his work clothes...sadly I‚Äòm not dating him anymore but honestly, his ability to run his own household smoothly was just so attractive. Maybe I‚Äôm just judgmental but it just gave me an impression of self-sufficiency and autonomy and I KNEW that dating him would mean I‚Äòd have an easier time sharing the household chores equally. Rather than me doing most of the chores as women in straight relationships are likely to do. Him running his own household in a healthy manner was just a very mature and manly behaviour that made me very happy. Maybe I‚Äòm weird.

Edit: Okay, this has blown up. Some people ask me why did I break up with the last guy, or why did he break up with me. You can read this [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/gwlctn/one_of_the_most_attractive_things_in_a_man/fswlyy9/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf). Other people have asked me about where I dated these men and where they were from. One guy was Greek, one was Cypriot Greek, one was half-English/Asian (will not disclose nation), one was Australian (the tidy guy at the end) and one was German. I dated the German in Germany and all the other ones in the UK. I actually forgot another guy, half-English/half-French, who also ran his own household perfectly well.

Edit 2: Here‚Äòs a speculation on why that guy stopped loving me, [click](https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/gwlctn/one_of_the_most_attractive_things_in_a_man/fswqeya/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)","If you're over the age of 25, there is no good excuse not to cook, clean, practice good hygiene, etc."
dating,12d2wov,2023-04-06 00:11:58,Men do *NOT* like chasing,"***Of course there probably are some men who go against this.***

I wanna know who TF is telling women we like chasing after you or that we will see you as desperate/clingy if you're the first one to reach out and text after a 1st date and etc.

At least from my own experience and that of my friends, chasing is not, I repeat NOT fun. I hate having to do it. It makes me feel like a loser or like some stupid chump. If I have to constantly re-initiate conversations, plan all the dates keep asking over and over when you're free etc. I'm gonna run outta steam and fucks really fast and/or assume you're not interested.

On the flip side, I f*cking love it when girls take the initiative to reach out, text back in a reasonable time frame and etc. I'm never going to think you're desperate/clingy if you reach out after the 1st date to tell me you had fun or look forward to a 2nd etc.

This has been your psa.","There needs to be a mutual give-and-take. If it‚Äôs too lopsided either way, it feels kind of desperate and needy. After a while, if it feels I‚Äôm pursuing too much, and it‚Äôs not being reciprocated, I‚Äôve learned to move on."

I played games and made excuses to touch her. She played along. We eventually went shopping. At around the 5 hour mark I met her sister and we got along well. We shopped some groceries so that we can bake tomorrow. While her sister went to a different store to buy something, my date grabbed my face and adjusted my face mask while looking me deeply into my eyes. My first thought was: Fuck, I need to rip this thing off. My second thought was omg pretty eyes and my last thought was: Maybe not in the middle of the shopping mall. My most successful date in 2022 so far. Meeting her again tomorrow. EDIT: Many people asks about the face mask. It is still mandatory to wear at shopping malls etc in my country.

dating,hqjbls,2020-07-13 17:11:17,I‚Äôm surprised at how normal it seems to be to expect sex relatively fast,"The other day I read a comment from a guy saying that if a girl hasn‚Äôt had sex with him by date 5, he assumes that she‚Äôs either not interested in him or not interested in sex in general and moves on. This seemed like quite a leap to me, but I marked it as an outlier and moved on. 

Today, there was a whole thread about it where many people agreed that it was a huge problem to not have sex/sexual contact by the 5th date. Is this view really that common? 

I‚Äôm someone who usually likes there to be a good emotional connection/building of trust first, and to me it seems a little wild that this is supposed to happen by the 5th date. If the dates started with the person as a total stranger,  I feel like you‚Äôre still just at the tip of the iceberg with getting to know them by 5 dates. 

I don‚Äôt know, I was just shocked by this consensus, and it seems like a wild leap to say that someone‚Äôs either asexual or not interested if there‚Äôs not sex by 5 dates. I will also say that as a woman, many guys will see you as ‚Äúeasy‚Äù for putting out too soon in their eyes, so it seems like a damned if you do, damned if you don‚Äôt kind of situation.

Edit: after reading the replies it seems like as a woman, it can be easy to feel like a guy‚Äôs just in it for the sex/not in it very seriously if he pushes for it too much/too fast, but as a guy, it can be easy to feel like the girl is not interested/not in it very seriously if the girl‚Äôs not having sex after a bit.

His point being: no guy would be ok with using a condom all the time. He isn‚Äôt threatening breakup or anything he just says the sex isn‚Äôt good. Is this true for all guys? Are my standards too high?

You could even make it a hidden field.
Edit: I'm not suggesting this be the only field on a dating site.  Just one that could be added. It would also be a hidden field.  You wouldn't see it on profiles but it would work during matching.

dating,dtdxew,2019-11-08 11:07:25,My first date in years was a disaster,"I recently took a break from working 80-90 hrs a week and just focused more on my health and life. I met this girl on Hinge, and while I wasn't super attracted to her, I also haven't gone on a date in many years. Thus, I said ""what the hell"" and went on a date with her. That was a big mistake. 

From the moment we sat down, she starts talking politics. Oh no. She tells me she's a major Trumper supporter, which isn't an absolute deal breaker, but when I asked her why she supported him, she said ""I like what he's doing with the minorities."" Now, mind you, I'm ASIAN, so I'm just cringing super hard and chuckling awkwardly to prevent a full on verbal assault. 

Then she starts talking to me about the penises that she's seen. She tells me that Asian guys have pretty small penises and that she hopes my ""pecker"" isn't too small. Now, I don't think I'm a small guy, but it definitely made me feel very insecure and a bit curious as to what the hell is wrong with her. I quickly changed the topic to pets to avoid another awkward conversation. 

Finally, as we're leaving the restaurant, she tells me about how guys who participate in gangbangs/threesomes are all gay because they like the sight of other men's cocks. This was not a topic that I was well versed in, so I made another effort to change the conversation. She then tells me out of nowhere that she doesn't like gay guys, and that's why she'll never participate in a threesome with two guys. At that point, I just wanted to get away from her, so I nodded and smiled at everything she said.

As we're getting in our separate cars to leave, she starts smoking a cigarette and then kisses me on the mouth. It wasn't great. She notices my grimace and laughs and says ""my daughter doesn't like me kissing her either when I'm smoking"". This was a real shocker considering we are both somewhat young, and her profile had no sign of any kids. I quickly said goodbye to her and drove home to take a stiff drink. Now I see why people say dating can be so exhausting. Weeding through the list of incompatible people is herculean, and the ones who find their soulmates quickly are truly blessed.

Edit: some context on why she acted that way: to be fair, she was going through a lot in life. She just broke up with her boyfriend of many years who refused to pay rent on the house they leased together. They broke up because he wanted to join a swingers club and she did not. Anyways, she had a plethora of money problems, and she had a lot of ‚Äúfirst date anxiety‚Äù which I suppose could explain all the weird conversation topics.","Oh my God, I'm sorry but I laughed my ass off reading this."
dating,k5ou89,2020-12-03 02:55:44,A very short lived fling can still result in long term pain,"I wrote this note over the summer after I fell for a guy way too quickly. It was over before I knew it. He told me that he found someone else. It still stings. Im still haunted by the ghost of what could‚Äôve been. I‚Äôm sharing this in hopes that someone relates to it. Thanks. 

I had been staring at the number zero for so long that when you came walking into my life, I thought you were the one. Not just a one, but my one. Silly me to think that connections worked so linearly, like the markers on a ruler. In other words, I had nothing and then I had you. It must be progress. Having you must be better than what I had. But the painful truth is that you were just another human, and not an addition to my life at all. My imagination had tricked me into seeing a future between us. I had taken limited data on you and extrapolated on it, like pixels spreading on a computer screen to create a picture. My mind had written a full profile of you, one that was a perfect match with mine. So when you stopped texting me that day, August 12th to be exact, I was heartbroken. Not because your silence meant an end to what we had, but because it meant an end to what we could have had, what we would have had, what I had visualized so vividly between us. And so as the saying goes, it is what it is; we suffer because we imagined different. I didn‚Äôt write that quote, but I certainly have been living it. In many ways, I have had an easy life. My suffering has often been self imposed, self inflicted. But the pain has been real and it has been difficult to treat because it comes from within. I have had to grieve the passing of many dreams. The deadly weapon is my mind. The cause of death is overthinking.","I agree...I have only talked to someone for a while,decided to talk to them exclusively as I did not have energy to continue other chats on the dating app. Turns out they were not attracted to me and it hurts more than I thought it would. I feel like my feelings are invalid because its all just a short-lived shallow connection but damn it feels intense. 
Its more than that, because I believed we had a chance. I believed he was into me. Like you, I am thinking of what could have been and the hurt of the expectations is immense. Our feelings are valid, and slowly we heal and slowly we learn üíî all the best to you on this journey"

I always insisted on taking it slow. There‚Äôs just so much BS out there and eventually it all comes out."
dating,kcpjat,2020-12-14 03:25:29,Lessons from dating,"Lessons I‚Äôve gathered over the last few years that will hopefully help someone else:

Address any insecurities within yourself before attempting to be with anyone else

Come already loved and whole; know your worth so that you won‚Äôt let anyone decide it for you

The moment you seriously question how they feel about you is when you need to walk away; a man who really wants you will make it consistently clear

If you have doubts or red flags in the beginning, don‚Äôt second guess, cut it off 

There are many good enough options; only pursue what you really want

Always be honest about your feelings 

Inconsistent actions are a consistent answer

Respect Is always the foundation. Without it, there‚Äôs nothing to build upon

Be choosy. Don‚Äôt give out your number/go on a date/open your heart until you know the non-negotiables 

Friendship is for those who didn‚Äôt do you wrong; don‚Äôt be afraid to burn a bridge 

Closure comes from within; from the knowledge that what‚Äôs for you will always be for you

If it feels forced then it‚Äôs not right; if you have to force it then it‚Äôs not right

Take that step of intimacy when YOU are ready

If it‚Äôs not a hell yes then it should always be a hell no

Don‚Äôt waste your time out of boredom, fill it with worthy things

If something bothers you, don‚Äôt ever let fear stop you from bringing it up. Your needs and desires matter too

If you don‚Äôt learn from past mistakes your bound to repeat them","> a man who really wants you will make it consistently clear 

As a man, this is true.

Also as a man, this pisses me of. Because it feels like i have to be absolutely clear and open for the sake of receiving a somewhat vague answer. 

Just to make things clear, we enjoy clear communication just as much."

dating,n8gu9l,2021-05-09 15:44:40,Why would anyone not put any effort into their appearance for a first date?,"This is not the first time it happens. I went on a date with a guy and he showed up wearing board-shorts, a tshirt that was dirty (idk what it was even but it looked like wood shavings by the neck of the tshirt), and flip flops. We went to a brewery so it was casual but like, its a first date at least put some nice shorts on and make sure your shirt is clean. His nails also weren‚Äôt trimmed and his hair was like he just woke up from a nap. I dont get it. He‚Äôs not even attractive to where you could say he can get away with it. There was no way to tell this from his pics because most of them were outdoorsy pics. I felt stupid making myself look nice (nothing fancy, I wore converse, but I looked nice and  like I put some effort). Needless to say there wont be a second date. Basic effort should be given from both sides, especially this early on when you‚Äôre trying to put your best self forward.



Edit: why so much defensiveness lol. Im not expecting anyone to show up in a suit, all I expect is cleanliness and something casual but more than what you would wear to just lounge around your house.","Wtf. Why are so many comments calling OP superficial and giving this guy the benefit of the doubt?


It's your FIRST date. You only have one chance to make a first impression. And yeah, dating is about looks initially. You should be well groomed, hair brushed, and dressed nicely. That's like bare fucking minimum people. 


Damn, I am starting to see why many people on Reddit are single and have no clue why."
dating,mn6a2x,2021-04-09 01:14:00,Getting a maybe is the same as getting a no,"I have learned that anytime I make the first move and ask someone to hang out or to go on a date, that I should take a maybe as a no. If it's not a yes, it's essentially a no and saying ""maybe"" is usually a nicely wrapped no.

When you ask someone out or ask to connect with someone and they don't give a straightforward answer, I would recommend moving on. Of course this is a case by case basis and sometimes the person doesn't know if they would be free on that day to hang out or go on a date. However, if they don't counter with other days and times that they would be available, I would move on.

For the most part, if someone is saying maybe or is dodging your question to hang out, they aren't interested in you.","Same here. When I hear a ""maybe"" or even ""I'll get back to you"", I tend to move on. And no, they usually don't get back to me."

dating,sclqth,2022-01-25 19:28:56,Is it shallow ending it with someone who has no ambitions?,"I‚Äôm in a bad situation with this guy who likes to think I‚Äôm ‚Äúhis‚Äù without wanting to actually date. There‚Äôs more to it but that‚Äôs the gist. I want to end things with him, but he‚Äôs really kind to me. My reasons are the following:

- doesn‚Äôt have a job, no plans to get one
- doesn‚Äôt want to go to school/into the military
- makes promises to do things in the future but never follows through
- no money, and any he gets is spent on weed
- no license (I always have to drive to him)

I am in college, work 2 jobs, and I hate if I sound pretentious for this but I just want someone that has the same goals as me. I want to travel, plan nice dates, and be proud to introduce them to my friends and family. That is not currently the case. Is it shallow to end it with him because of this?

Edit since people keep mentioning this: I was attracted to his fun personality, and thought he was cute enough. However, I don‚Äôt know why but I think the reasons above have turned me off of his appearance and personality so there‚Äôs basically nothing left. I am going to end it tonight and update.

Final update: This happened a lot faster than I thought it would but the support on this post opened my eyes. I sent him a long text, including my reasons for ending it but also wishing him well and blocked his number. Not that big of an update but it‚Äôs done, I‚Äôm a little upset right now and feel pretty alone but I know I have good days ahead. Thanks everyone.

Second update: This is the last one I promise, I‚Äôm only doing this because people are disagreeing with the way I ended things. It couldn‚Äôt be in person because with my schedule we wouldn‚Äôt be able to see each other soon and I wanted it to be done. A phone call would probably have been better, and I suppose I am a coward for not doing that but I didn‚Äôt think I could handle hearing his voice. I included in the text my reasons for blocking his number, was very sincere, and let him know he could reach out on another social media if he needed to. He did, said he was sorry it didn‚Äôt work out, he thanked me for everything, and that‚Äôs it. I don‚Äôt really think texting is as harsh as everyone makes it out to be, especially when we were both okay with it, and I would not be upset if that was how someone ended it with me (someone told me to put myself in his shoes). Again, thank you all for your advice and critiques.","While reading this, I broke up with him for you."
dating,p0ujwz,2021-08-09 04:48:59,approaching women,"Last night I went out with my boyfriend and some friends. I went to the bar alone to order another drink, and while I was waiting, this guy says, ""I like your glasses."" I say the usual ""Thanks, they help me see,"" and he says that they make me look really cute.

At this point my boyfriend joins me in line. I tell the guy thanks and he leaves.

I have no idea if he was cute or not, as it was pretty dark and I was several drinks in. But this compliment was really sweet, didn't make me feel icky, and didn't make me feel like he was creeping on me. The interaction was so flirty and it made me feel really good about myself. 

Obviously he was never going to score with me (boyfriend is too handsome) but I think he's found a nice approach, which is: give me an innocuous compliment (not about my body, not about my appearance, not even about *me*) and, if I'm receptive, build up from there. It is possible to approach women at the bar without freaking them out. Go forth!

Edit; for everyone asking: yes. I would leave my boyfriend if I met someone hotter. /s y‚Äôall are dumb","Sorry, I had to laugh at ""Thanks, they help me see,"" then ""I have no idea if he was cute or not""."

We see you. You were very convincing. Every reason you gave, from ""I'll be moving soon and can't be tied down"" to ""I have way too much going on in my life/too many balls in the air to devote time to seriously dating"" to ""my previous relationship really did a number on me and I'm more cautious now"" to ""I just want to make sure we're a solid match first"" to whatever else you came up with that I can't even remember...the performance alone was Oscar worthy.

It‚Äôs gonna hurt but we move.,"The issue is falling in love or being extremely attached not with the physical person, but with the mental image or idea of THAT person that we make up in our heads. We make up this scenario of our ideal person and try to get said person to match this description. You ignore a bunch of red flags because of this mental image we so dearly like.

I think the more time you spend connecting with a good looking person, more feelings are created. I believe we have the power to control who we're into. I don't think soul mates exist.

EDIT: This post blew up more than I anticipated... Thanks for all your answers.

EDIT 2: When I say attractive I'm not just talking about physical attraction, I'm talking about all the characteristics that make the person attractive. I know you need more than physical attraction to fall in love. That's super superficial lol. All you need is attraction","I look at early stages of relationships as just infatuation.

I‚Äôve never been very good at dating, and whenever I (23M) seek out advice, whether on the internet or in person, I get this response like 90% of the time, and I‚Äôm fucking sick of it. I want actual tangible advice, not this comment that, in essence, is entirely dismissive of any questions I have or what I am feeling.

I'm with you OP, people need to date when they're younger to understand what they like/dislike. I never dated until I hit my late 20's and I didn't understand how to flirt and only by actively dating, did I learn anything. It wasn't something I could just ""read"" on the internet and understand."

I have felt a lot of pressure since I am a  30 years old female and should be a certain place in my life with relationships. However, I‚Äôve decided to better other aspects of my life such making my house a home, making more money and working on side hustles, and bettering my nonromantic relationships.

dating,mglh5p,2021-03-30 17:37:59,Being bisexual in the dating pool is supposed to give me ‚Äúmore options‚Äù but in reality I have more chances of being rejected,There‚Äôs a huge misconception about bisexual people being more promiscuous or more likely to cheat that really impacts me telling someone my sexuality. I know that often by experience in telling them they assume that I just have sex with everyone. People assume i‚Äôm always open to a 3 some or it makes me seem like i‚Äôm more of a hook up/fwb than relationship material. I feel like i‚Äôm seen as more of a sexual object than a potential partner. It‚Äôs even worse in my opinion in the lgbt community. For some reason they feel like it invalidates the their sexuality by me liking and being open to dating everyone. Like the fact that I had contact with the opposite gender somehow makes them less gay? Like what! The biphobia is real. The community that is supposed to accept me I find even more rejection in. I know that no ones obligated at all to give me a chance but to blow me off cause of something I can‚Äôt change is just low.,"I am a bisexual woman, and to this day have only had sex with men because women dont seem to take bisexual women seriously or into consideration.

Dating apps do suck. I‚Äôve had much better luck in person. I would personally use both, if I were you, but only use dating apps as like 10% of your focus. Think of them as a supplement, but not your main strategy. 

You‚Äôll have much better luck spending time with friends, going places, doing new things, and joining groups. If you‚Äôre religious at all, join a church. If you‚Äôre not religious, join some kind of activity based thing where others will be like a rock climbing gym."
dating,gsuc51,2020-05-29 14:49:06,I won‚Äôt change myself for a man anymore,"I had a date the other night that really made me think. 
The date itself was fine, at first. I (a 29F) had someone I‚Äôve been chatting with and gone out with twice before (a 30M) over for dinner. I worked hard all day to make things nice before he got there. I put on my favorite new dress, deep cleaned the house, strung up lights in the three seasons room since that‚Äôs where we‚Äôd be eating, lit my favorite candles from Anthropologie, etc. it was nice! When he got there he said I looked great and so did the house and the food smelled good. Things were off to a decent start. 
Then as we talked more while the food was cooking I started to realize we are VERY different people. Like to the point where we just might not be compatible. 
The difference? Well he talked a lot about wanting to live in a van on a farm and keeping bees and trying to live ‚Äúzero waste‚Äù. That‚Äôs all well and good but I almost felt like he was shaming me for not being so extreme with being environmentally conscious. I am conscious of it...I am vegan for ethical and environmental reasons. However, I have my limits. Like I‚Äôm not going to live in a van. I worked really hard to get where I am today. I‚Äôve been able to afford myself and above average life. I don‚Äôt live extravagantly but I do enjoy quality things. 

For the majority of the date I tried to be open minded and see things from his perspective. After all, I am always trying to better myself and if he can teach me something, I‚Äôm all ears. However, as the night wore on things got more personal. He talked about farming...which I know a lot about since I‚Äôm a farmers daughter. I grew up on one of the largest produce farms on the east coast and I know what it takes to farm large scale. He seemed to dismiss that and continued to tell me why non-organic farming is essentially the devils work. I came back with some valid arguments to the contrary but realized he was not amenable to entertaining a thought that didn‚Äôt align with his opinion so I just started nodding in agreement with him to end the conversation. Then he asked me my stance on monogamy- I said that‚Äòs my goal. He said he‚Äôd be ‚Äúopen to monogamy‚Äù if that was something I wanted (aka implying that‚Äôs not his normal and he‚Äôs used to dating multiple ppl at a time). It made me uncomfortable. I know that is ok with a lot of folks but it‚Äôs not for me. I told him that. Then he said that was OK and that this is ‚Äúsomething new for both of us.‚Äù I asked what he meant and he said he‚Äôs not used to dating someone so ‚Äústatus quo.‚Äù What the hell, right?! I asked him to elaborate and he said ‚Äúlook around. You own this home. You‚Äôre successful and definitely not my usual type. It‚Äôs intimidating.‚Äù I think he meant to flatter me but it felt like sandpaper. To me all I heard was ‚Äúyou‚Äôre basic and your life is not alternative enough for me and I‚Äôd be doing you a favor by dating you exclusively.‚Äù Maybe that‚Äôs not how he meant it but that‚Äôs what I heard. 
In that moment I knew I could either try and alter myself to threaten his ego less or I could walk away from it. I chose the latter. Also side note- he wanted to hook up but I said no and he suggested a tantric breathing exercise together instead. I‚Äôm sorry but WHAT?! I knew in that moment that choosing the latter was the best option for me. 

Ever since the date I‚Äôve been thinking about WHY I‚Äôm still dating (although I did just get out of a long term partnership with someone more compatible so it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm undatable). I realized I‚Äôm just not willing to coddle a man‚Äôs ego who I barely even know anymore. I can‚Äôt date the men who are so strong in their convictions that they end up personally attacking me for not conforming to their niche way of living. I can‚Äôt then change who I am to make THEM feel more comfortable. I can‚Äôt have debates with a man who goes into these conversations thinking I‚Äôm not going to speak intelligently about a conflicting opinion or who flat out unwilling to hear a conflicting opinion.  

Maybe my dating pool may shrink as my likeminded peers are settling down but maybe that‚Äôs not a bad thing.","you're completely valid in your feelings and i agree 100% but mostly im commenting to say that i fucking LOST IT at ""he wanted to hook up but I said no and he suggested a tantric breathing exercise together instead."""

dating,od18iq,2021-07-03 16:24:45,Why do men keep getting their penises out in my car?,"So this has happened to me on 2 first dates and 1 2nd date. The second date was last night and luckily it didn‚Äôt get to the penis actually being out because through experience I knew what was about to happen and asked politely for him not to get his cock out. Every time it has happened after making out for a few minutes.
Is it a thing that I am missing here? Do these men think that if they get their penises out I will have no choice but to touch them? What is the thought process that goes through their heads? Am I putting out some kind of ‚Äúget your penis out please‚Äù vibe? 
As this is now the third time this has happened I am starting to think it is something that I am doing wrong! So any insight would be greatly appreciated!

Edit: to add some context to the situation as these are the most common comments. 

-the first date men asked for lifts home or lifts to the train station and the penis reveal happened before I had even driven anywhere.

-I clearly stated before making out that I did not want to have sex with them as to not lead them on or fill them with expectations in any way.",Unless a woman tries to unzip my pants during a make out session then I'm not expecting anything else to happen. Apparently though that's just me.
dating,ssysbi,2022-02-15 09:06:02,Do you know what women care about a lot more than the size of your dick? The firmness of your dick.,"Stop obsessing over the size of your dick. It's not why women don't like you. Stop watching so much porn. Masturbating is perfectly healthy, but watching porn can mess with your mind.

Being obsessed with things like penis size is not going to help you when it can barely even get hard, and you don't know how to use it. Focus on improving what you have. Want longer-lasting, harder erections? Lose the gut. Lose the porn. Improve your diet. Stop using drugs and drinking so much. All of this will help. Also, if you lose your gut, you might look bigger too.

Work on your kissing and other foreplay skills will help too. Those things matter more to most women than penis size.

Bottom line? Yes, some women care about penis size, but stop worrying about what you can't control. Most women will want to be with you if they like you and think you're a great kisser. Add to that some good sex skills, and you're in. Quit the pity party, quit the negative attitude toward women quit the porn, and quit the obsession with things you can't control. You might actually find a girlfriend or at least get something better than your hand.","Being a good kisser is so much more important than a big dick. And yeah, know how to use your fingers and tongue. For most women, 90% of getting turned on is mental/emotional, so work harder on making that emotional connection first, flirt, tease, cuddle, nonsexual touch are all part of foreplay that can build up that sexual tension before you even get started. Those things are way more important than a big dick."

She is my age (30), divorced, and mother to a 7-year-old son. She says she will introduce us when the time is right, and I agree as I would do the same thing with her and my (4-year-old) daughter.

dating,m18381,2021-03-09 14:57:14,I have accepted the dehumanization of the dating process and I'm coping a lot better. Dating is like a job hunt process.,"I am not a fully fledged person with my own hopes and fears and desires.  I am my height, my income, my body, and my capacity to entertain.  I do not become more than this until I have earned the right.  

An invested romantic partner may care, but no girl I'm going on a first, second, or even third date wants to hear about my issues, struggles, or less than attractive aspects of my personality.  They want to be entertained, and only after I have provided sufficient entertainment do I earn the right to share genuine emotional intimacy.

To contrast, I didn't let the cutthroat and dehumanizing nature of job searching get me down.  My ego didn't get bruised when a potential employer didn't call me back; I didn't go into a spiral of self-doubt.  I didn't go looking for validation or emotional connection from a potential employer.  I didn't double-text the HR rep of that one really cool company.  I just opened up indeed.com and sent out more applications; I did adequate research on companies I applied to without seeming over-eager; I followed up at reasonable intervals; and during interviews I spent my mental energy on being astute and tactful rather than on self-doubt and anxiety.

I need to treat dating the same way.  Your employer doesn't care about your issues until after they've already hired you and spent resources training you, so don't mention to them how your car is running rough and needs a transmission job during the interview!

**EDIT**: To clarify, there is a difference between 'dumping' / oversharing on someone vs. being honest about your shortcomings when they come up in conversation.  Everyone should know not to do the former, but I've also learned the hard way to avoid the latter as much as possible so long as you're not outright lying.  Don't mention that COVID was rough on your career, or that first dates make you kind of nervous, or that your car is rough and needs work, or how long you've been single.  Present yourself as the best candidate you can possibly be, and they can judge for themselves.",Having no expectations is key.

Did I miss any red flags? Should we have kissed? Man, it was a great kiss. Did they notice the scar on my forehead? Did I talk too much about myself? Should I get back on Tinder and talk to other people‚Äîafter all it was just one great date.

I wish I could just skip this part, it‚Äôs such a drag. I want to fold time and step into our third date, where we can touch each other casually, don‚Äôt feel the need to fill a silence, or overthink every message we exchange.

My best advice is keep yourself busy doing things that you enjoy, at least that‚Äôs what I am doing to cope and it has helped me a lot. I am going for long walks everyday and exploring hiking trails. I enjoy baking and painting and that‚Äôs what I am surrounding myself with, along with socializing with my friends online.

dating,s1l0bh,2022-01-11 19:18:10,There is nothing wrong with not wanting to be alone.,"There's this movement in the self-help industry that you should be ""happy"" on your own, no matter what. And only after you're happy, you should look for somebody. And if you're not ""happy"" on your own, then you're focus is misguided.  This idea of hyper independence is ingrained in us. Women and men. Women are supposed to ""need no man"". Men are supposed to be these hyper stoic creatures.

The truth is though that nobody who has really long dry spells says that. It's always people who are in a good position who claim that they wouldn't be bothered. Similiar to people with money who will tell everybody about the insignificance of money. Either that or people who have given up.

Looking for a partner is not about looking for happiness. It's about recognizing that you're a social animal. I'm not buying into the idea that we need to be content alone. Ultimately, we're here to couple up. There's a very old instinct that's driving both men and women to come together.

Futhermore : The biggest healing happens in relationships and not on your own.

Don't let self-help authors or frankly any other people who don't even take their own advice shame you into thinking there's something wrong you if being without a partner bothers you.","I think the point is also about not **needing** to be in a relationship.

dating,txr0os,2022-04-06 17:09:33,Why does it seem that having sex for the first time immediately changes the dynamic and makes the guy lose interest?,"I \[21F\] had been seeing this guy \[22M\] for about a month and a half. From the beginning, he was up front about how he wasn't looking for a hookup, but at the same time he only wanted to date casually, as he would be moving away for grad school next semester and did not want anything too serious. I was totally fine with that, as I also wasn't necessarily looking to get into a serious relationship. And from the beginning he showed me a lot of respect and care (ex: he asked me if it was okay to hold my hand, give me a hug goodbye, and to kiss me for the first time on our second date; and he checked in with me to make sure he wasn't doing anything to make me uncomfortable or going too fast). I felt comfortable around him since sex didn't seem to be his ""end goal"" at all; the caution he took in even asking to hold my hand made me feel like he wasn't  looking to just get laid or anything.  He always insisted to pay on our dates, we went to an outdoor festival for one of our dates and he introduced me to a few of his friends there and we all hung out, and he told me that I'm the only person he's talking to/seeing right now (he's the only one I'm talking to as well).

Last week, we went back to his place after dinner and we had texted prior about being ready to have sex. I felt even more safe because he made sure to ask about my sexual preferences/boundaries and we made sure we were on the same page. The sex was great and I enjoyed myself and it seemed he did as well. However, immediately after, he seemed to suddenly become quiet/distant. We did cuddle for a little bit and he made sure I was okay, but then after I went to the bathroom and came back, he said he was gonna shower and then left me feeling awkward laying on his bed. When he came back he was fully dressed and didn't come back next to me, so I suddenly felt extremely out of place and I rushed to get myself dressed. He was never mean or rude, but he told me that his roommates would probably be back soon and that it was getting late. He didn't have to tell me twice, I already felt horribly awkward. He still walked me outside to my car but only gave me a quick kiss and side hug, unlike the usual way we would part ways after a date. He hasn't texted me since, 5 days ago. I guess I'm just frustrated because I was totally cool with just dating casually, I even would've been okay with just casual hookups, so then what changed his mind? Was the sex that bad for him? Did having sex suddenly make me unattractive to him? He had texted me before saying he liked me, he felt comfortable around me, and expressed looking forward to see me before we'd go on dates. We went on 6 dates before ever having sex. Maybe I'm just really na√Øve? But like would a guy really go through all of that trouble to keep up with a girl for a month and a half, paying for all the dates, introducing me to his friends, just to drop me the second after we hooked up for the first time?","Research post-nut clarity.

dating,c15xea,2019-06-16 04:00:27,"If you can't tell if she's interested, read this."," Women.

&nbsp;

They can be extremely frustrating to deal with when it comes to figuring out if they‚Äôre into you or not.

&nbsp;

It‚Äôs a terrible feeling to read signals wrong and make a move, only to find out she didn‚Äôt intent to come off as interested, or that she was just being nice to you. It can really hinder your ability and confidence to feel comfortable with approaching the next woman. And in some cases, it can leave a really bad taste in guy‚Äôs mouths about women in general.

&nbsp;

These things suck, and I‚Äôve seen a healthy amount of posts asking for ways to read into women‚Äôs interest. Does she like you if she‚Äôs playing with her hair? If she‚Äôs having a conversation with you? If she likes your shirt? Where the fuck do you draw the line from friendly to interested? 

&nbsp;

Fortunately, there are subtle things women do that indicate strongly that she‚Äôs interested in you, and that you‚Äôre golden for an approach. 

&nbsp;

____

&nbsp;

Generally, (because there are always expectations to the rule) women won‚Äôt come right out and tell you that they like you. It‚Äôs unfortunate, but it‚Äôs also reality in our current social climate. Women are taught to let the men pursue, let the men approach you first. Let the men ask to take you out. They‚Äôre taught that to openly pursue a man makes you look like a slut, a whore, an easy girl. And women try to avoid these types of labels.

&nbsp;

Because women are usually raised or conditioned in this manner, they don‚Äôt like taking the lead in regard to approaching. Luckily, they still like us, and they still want to help us understand when they like us. When a woman is interested in you, she‚Äôs much more likely to give hints and throw subtleties your way, hoping that you‚Äôll pick up on what‚Äôs going on and make a move.

&nbsp;

A lot of guys will hear this and simply choose to not waste their time, which is understandable. Why put effort into a girl that can‚Äôt express how she feels?

&nbsp;

The thing about that mindset though, is that women that come right out and say ‚ÄúJohn, I really like you, and I‚Äôd like it if you took me out sometime,‚Äù are fucking rare. Very fucking rare. And if you decide to sit around and wait for that type of woman, you‚Äôll be waiting for a *very* long time.

&nbsp;

When you don‚Äôt have the luxury of bold women approaching you, you‚Äôve got to read the signs. And I‚Äôd like to share some valuable knowledge that **really** helped me out with knowing when a woman was genuinely interested in me, or was just being friendly or nice.

&nbsp;

____

&nbsp;

**If a woman is interested/comfortable with you, she‚Äôll put herself in your orbit.**

&nbsp;

Now, what does this mean? 

&nbsp;

When a woman likes you, she'll go out of her way to be around you. She'll look for opportunities to touch you, speak to you, or just look at you if you're at a distance. This translates to the texting/calling game too. Have you ever had a girl you've known for a while just text you out the blue with ""Hey"", ""Hi"" or ""What's up?"". Secret gentlemen, she's putting herself in your orbit. She's more than likely hoping you'll take her *invitation* and turn it into a date. The simplest way to go about doing so is this. If a woman you're getting to know or dating texts/calls you, but isn't talking about anything in particular, schedule a date. She's thinking about you, and wants to see you. She probably won't come right out and say so, (I know, frustrating) but you've got to read between the lines.

&nbsp;

____

&nbsp;

**General Contact (Verbal/Texting)**

&nbsp;

Going back to putting herself in your orbit, what does this mean? Let‚Äôs say you've got someone who you work with. She seems to always greet you when you or she arrives. More interestingly, she always seems to find you, wherever you are, and say farewell when she or you leave. If a woman is constantly greeting you and wishing you well when one or both of you leave work, she's more than likely interested. Especially if she doesn't give everyone at the workplace the same kindness. She's putting herself in your orbit to make it easier for you to make a move.

&nbsp;

Women also carry out this same behavior over texts. If you receive a random text from a woman you‚Äôre dating, something along the lines of: 

&nbsp;

-	I just saw this random thing and it reminded me of you!
-	I just thought about that time we went to x!
-	Hey, what are you doing?
-	Are you doing anything today?
-	I just thought about you.
-	How are you? 

&nbsp;

She‚Äôs thinking about you. You crossed her mind, and instead of coming right out and saying, ‚ÄúI want to see you, ask me out,‚Äù or just asking *you* out on a date (again, frustrating, I know), she‚Äôll put herself in your orbit, she‚Äôll make her presence known, and hope that you understand her actions enough to realize she wants you, in some way, and should schedule a time to get together.

&nbsp;

____

&nbsp;

**Physical Contact**

&nbsp;

Another way women put themselves in your orbit is through physical touch. Men, if a woman is constantly bumping/brushing up against you, she's interested. I don't care **what** anybody says. People are more than aware of their personal space. They will not consistently bump/brush up against someone that they do not find appealing, physically or in general.

&nbsp;

Likewise, if she's always touching parts of your body, again, she's interested. She's initiating the touch barrier and letting you know she's cool with physical touch. Obviously, don't lose your mind with this statement, that doesn't mean you're good to start squeezing her ass, but if a woman is touching you, it's her way to saying, ""I'm okay with you being physical with me"". 
&nbsp;

Again, it's more frustrating than her just saying ""I'm totally down if you touched me dude"", but again, woman aren't generally that forward.

&nbsp;

____

&nbsp;

**Eye Contact**

&nbsp;

Finally, eye contact. Fellas, if you‚Äôve caught a girl staring at you for the fifteenth time, she‚Äôs interested in you. I know you may think she‚Äôs starting at something behind you, or looking at somebody that happens to be close by you, but let‚Äôs be honest here. If you‚Äôre consistently finding her gaze at you, even when you **move** locations, she‚Äôs staring at something she likes, which is you.

&nbsp;

Now, I understand eye contact can be iffy at times. So, if you‚Äôre still on the fence on whether a girl is looking at you because she‚Äôs interested, or because she‚Äôs just so disgusted with you, the next time you catch you looking, maintain eye contact for a second, and **grin**. You don‚Äôt have to full on smile if you don‚Äôt want to.

&nbsp;

If she smiles back at you, even if she averts eye contact while doing it (it‚Äôs okay, she‚Äôs nervous), she‚Äôs interested, and she wants you to approach her. If she doesn‚Äôt smile back, and looks away, sorry champ, she isn‚Äôt into it.

&nbsp;

____

&nbsp;

These aren‚Äôt *all* the signs women show to express their interest in you, but they‚Äôre the basic things to look out for in you‚Äôre wanting to know if you‚Äôve got a shot or not. Perhaps one day we‚Äôll live in world where everyone can just be blunt and honest, without fear of rejection. But until that day, I hope this information can help you.

dating,vnhekg,2022-06-29 14:41:50,The guy I went on a date with lied about his looks,"I met a guy on hinge and on his profile it said he was 5'10 and when we met he had to be 5'5 (I'm F 5'4). I noticed on the date but didn't want to make a big deal right then and there so I didn't say anything but I definetly noticed. It started to bother me so a few days later I asked why it said 5'10 on his profile when it was obvious he wasn't. He had zero remorse and said ""well many of you care too much about height and I wanted more matches"". I'm like okay you do realize that one your lying and two that's not going to make someone like you. He genuinely thought I was just going to overlook this and keep talking to him. Guess what I didn't, He's unmatched and blocked. I honestly didn't find him physically attractive because of his size and the lying was the extra confirmation that I needed. Still annoyed I wasted my gas but whatever, taking another long break from online dating.

Update: all that open-mindess goes out the window when you lie and purposely deceive someone for your own benefit. It's also my right to have a preference on the men I date. I don't have to give every man a chance just because they want one. The entitlement on this post is insane.

And for the men saying ""well at least he got a date."" Yeah money out of his pocket gone. Didn't get a kiss. Nothing from me besides my time because I wasn't attracted to him.

Yesterday, he was pushing for a date again and I lied to him that I currently didn‚Äôt look like my pics and that I had gained about 30lbs due to the pandemic and being inactive (this is a lie, I look exactly like my pics).

They are simply getting the perks and inconveniences of being in a relationship. Likewise people that get laid are not better than people that don‚Äôt. All of that is toxic bullshit,"I agree you should be looking at this separately, as in whether someone is in a relationship or single does not define whether they're a good or bad person, I would hope that this is something everyone should know. Being single isn't something to be ashamed of, if anything being alone gives you the time to work on improving yourself (for your own benefit, not to attract others) and building your individuality and creating a happy life. An added benefit is that once you are happy alone, you may meet someone that admires you for who you are as a unique person and wants to be an addition to your already great life, not become the sole purpose of your life or validation of your worth.

One last thing I would mention, just solely looking at your title, I do think that healthy people with their life in order and someone who has dealt with their attachment styles (if they previously had issues with that), should be attracted to ""good"" people in general, this extends not only to finding a partner, but to friends, acquaintances, family members etc, you want to keep good people that positively influence you in your life and remove toxic people."
dating,ft9po8,2020-04-01 22:03:40,Become the person you want to date,"I realised today that you have to become the person you want to date which usually means you have to upgrade yourself.

You can't date an intelligent person if you're not intelligent yourself.

You can't date a smart and fashionable person if you're not smart and fashionable yourself.

I stepped back and asked myself whether I would date myself and I straight up said no because I am not stylish, super fun, adventurous or really intelligent; all the qualities I want in a partner. And sadly, I am not attracting that calibre of a partner right now.

However, I have committed myself to improving my style by dressing well and mixing with people of the same calibre in their environments.

I have committed to developing my knowledge and skills though learning languages - currently learning Spanish and have a teacher, structure and infrastructure in place to succeed.

I have committed to exploring the world and having stories to tell about the wonderful people I have met and connected with along my journey.

And none of what I have said is easy but it's definitely worth it in the end.","One of my friends brought this up the other day. They mentioned it as a reason they don't feel comfortable dating, because they wouldn't date themselves right now due to their weight.

Tldr: I realize this question may get asked a lot but I am way out of touch in the dating game. Please bear with me and maybe just give advice on how you'd like to be approached by a woman in the gym.

This post is two-fold. First, I would like an answer to my question. I am very new here but I am seeing a couple posts that have men saying they like when women make the first move. But I am also seeing that when they do, the guy is usually in a relationship as to why they didn't make the first move.

Second, I am thinking about making the first move with a guy at the gym and I am a wreck. I haven't dated in YEARS but I am now widowed and am finally comfortable dating again.

This guy has only been coming to my gym for about 2 weeks but he has made it a point to say hi and bye, move out of my way at the machines, smile, eye contact, etc. At first I thought he was just being nice but this happens every time we are there together and I don't see him addressing other women like that. I am interested but he hasn't made any real conversation with me and I don't know if/when making a move at the gym is appropriate or if I am getting the wrong idea. He probably has a gf doesn't he? Help!","1) YES for the love of all that is holy please make the first move. Most of us would kill for that to happen to us just once. 

2) We're routinely told not to approach women at the gym, or at the store, or basically anywhere in public that's not the bar or a dating app. Which is part of what is making dating basically impossible for most normal guys. We never know if you are interested enough to want us to make the first move, or if you'll be upset if we do.  You making the first move helps eliminate that barrier to contact. 

3) So what if he has a girlfriend? Not everyone you ask out or ar interested in are going to date you. Men risk this every time we approach someone."
dating,jsepau,2020-11-11 19:22:16,DAE crave intimacy but enjoys being alone and doesn't want to get into the dynamics of dating?,"27f here. The concept of dating (intentionally going out and finding someone, getting to know each other, etc.) isn't something I want to go through. Personality-wise I don't know how to flirt at all and I feel sick and like I'm not being myself when I try. When guys flirt with me or have sent suggestive texts in the past, I don't know how to respond except to be friendly and platonic-sounding back which just kills the whole flirty vibe of the conversations.

I also really enjoy being by myself and wish things could happen naturally and without me having to actively seek out someone, like with the friendships I have in my life. I've never dated anyone before or been exclusive with anyone, and I'm fine with that.

At the same time though, I crave intimacy and I'm a bit scared of being single forever. I wish I could be true to my non-flirty, friendly self and also not die alone lol.

Do you relate to this? And if so, how do you deal with this? Is it possible to be a really non-flirty person but also be in a relationship?

Edit: Thanks for the awards!! I didn't know so many people would relate to this, it helps me to know that I'm not the only one üòä

You are correct in thinking that you should just be yourself, but that doesn‚Äôt mean you shouldnt go out of your comfort zone. Like you said you have never dated anyone so I wouldn‚Äôt expect you to be flirty. It seems your portraying being flirtatious as a personality trait but it‚Äôs not something your born with. Being good at flirting is a skill you improve on with each relationships. The way I imagine it is like saying your bad at dribbling but you have never played basketball before. I strongly suggest you just stop worrying so much on the specifics and rather focus on trying new things and going out of your comfort zone. You said your friendly and that alone should take you a long way."
dating,mjy4hq,2021-04-04 15:15:50,Guys that clearly didnt put any effort into their appearance for a date,"Why? Ive been on at least a couple dates where the guy shows up with baggy/kinda wrinkled clothes, scruffy face (not good scruffy), hair that looks like he was taking a nap, and either some ugly flip flops (like the ones you wear when you‚Äôre going outside real quick) or some slipper looking loafers. 
One time I even went on a date with someone who had gone on a run and didnt have time to take a shower so went on the date like that, just threw some jeans over his running shorts. You knew we had a date you should‚Äôve and could‚Äôve planned your time better. This specific guy was arrogant too, big surprise. Im putting the effort to look nice and giving you my time. The least you can do is try to look presentable too. 

Biggest turnoff.

Also, just fyi if you put some nice smelling cologne on that instantly makes you like 10x more attractive, doesnt even matter what you wear lol

Edit: a point some people are missing is its not just about what the guy wears and being superficial. Its that a guy putting in effort shows how he is as a person, it tells you something about his character.","My biggest thing about meeting a guy is clean. If it's a very casual meetup like coffee or drinks, I don't expect dressed up, but I expect clean. I don't want someone to go out of their way to look that much different than their norm, but at the same time, show that you give a shit. 

On the flip side though, I went on a tinder date yesterday where the guy was so incredibly nervous and shocked that I didn't stand him up (despite the fact that I kept very open communication and told him I was on my way) that it made me realize that it probably happens relatively often. I think there are so many bots and stuff on tinder, that guys almost don't believe real women exist on there lol. Either that or they are very cautious/doubtful."

dating,f74lc5,2020-02-21 02:50:09,I started dating a guy who has his shit together,"I feel like every guy i meet either don't have a job, or are lazy as hell, messy, doesn't know how to do basic things like dishes or laundry. 

But I just started seeing a guy who lives on his own, has his own car, has a good job, keeps a clean place and knows how to adult. 

He might be a robot. 

I will update.

Update: Hes 5'7. All of you stop crying about height.

Update 2: It has now been 1 month since we started seeing each other. He has introduced me to so many things i have never done before (like ice fishing, riding a motorcycle, archery) He is always so fun and active but he also give me my own life.  If i am out with friends, he doesn't blow up my phone checking in the whole night. He just lets me live my life and is happy I'm having a good time. So far he is quite amazing, full 360 from my last relationships. He's so attentive to my needs and we have a rediculous amount in common but are so different at the same time. This could actually become something amazing.","There are also plenty of good guys out there who have great careers, are financially secure, motivated, driven, genuine, loving people and try and be fun and exciting when meeting women and find themselves with few opportunities to date and pretty disappointing experiences from the ones they manage to. I also acknowledge there are women out there who share your experiences. Hope it goes well for you."

But I appreciate men because I sure have never initiated a first kiss with someone, or even holding hands, or mostly anything for that matter. Im trying to change that and be more confident! But its scary! Like bringing yourself to make the first move is hard lol and ive always left it in their hands to make the first move because I just dont have the guts. Like I said im trying to change that. As a women I know we have our own struggles, like finding a man who doesnt just want sex or someone who actually wants to commit, but I just wanted to thank men for taking on the role of being the initiators.","Oh for sure, going for that kiss thinking we are hitting it off, then she turns her face and responds what are you doing, gosh made me feel humiliated."
dating,gd5lmh,2020-05-04 05:24:15,A couple things I‚Äôve learned after years of online dating/ dating in general‚Ä¶,"\-Straight up ask guys what they are looking for. Make sure that you guys are on the same page. If he wants something causal and you are looking for a LTR, DO NOT TRY TO MAKE HIM CHANGE HIS MIND. You deserve someone who is looking for the same think as you

\-If a guy is not putting effort in the conversation chances are he is not that interested in you

\-People will come up with lame excuses to hide their bad behavior....""I don't believe in labels."" During the first months of dating take these as a potential red flag

\-During the first months of dating never take his words too seriously. ""I see a future together..."" Wait until the honeymoon phase has faded away to understand his true intentions.

\-When you go on a first date, have zero expectations, even if you matched with the CEO of this Tech company. Some people are very different in person or hide their true personality over a ""nice guy"" facade. Tell yourself that you are just gonna enjoy the evening with some cool company.

\-Ask deep questions that go beyond superficial stuff as hobbies and music

\-Actions speak louder than words

\-Discuss stuff over FaceTime or in-person. Avoid disagreement over text. Some people are amazing writers that make you believe that they are willing to change.

\-The moment you feel that he is not putting effort into the relationship, confront him. If he doesn‚Äôt change‚Ä¶ END IT. You deserve something better

\-Being someone‚Äôs gf is more than a title. Ask yourself, does he actually treats me like a SO?

\-Don‚Äôt come up with weird theories of why he is acting weird. ""Maybe he hasn‚Äôt called me cause he is stressed."" If someone is truly interested in you, they‚Äôll take the time (This is true 90% of the time)‚Ä¶believe me

\-Never change your boundaries for a SO, if you are not ok with kissing on the first day don‚Äôt do it. Players seem to smell when people are willing to break their boundaries for love and they‚Äôll often take advantage of you.

\-Successful career doesn‚Äôt indicate emotional maturity 

\-If you are looking for something meaningful don‚Äôt sleep with them right away. See if they are willing to get to known you 

\-Watch out for guys who often compare with their ex most of the times this indicates that they haven‚Äôt gotten over her

\- Don‚Äôt express your insecurities early on 
Is he ten times hotter than you? Is he your first bf? Do you feel that you are not attractive? 
If he asked you out on a date is because he finds you attractive. Players can smell insecurities, you are way more than just a pretty face :)

\- Ask yourself am I in love with the guy or am in love with the idea of being in love? 

\- Have a clear idea what you want but don‚Äôt got out of your way to accomplish it. Let‚Äôs say that you want a relationship, try to meet people and see if thing workout but don‚Äôt try to force it 

\- During the first months of dating take things slow. Don‚Äôt go out of your way to make him happy. 

This also applies to girls‚Ä¶..

Edit: I decided to put this bullet point together after reading so many post of people being played

Edit 2: Added the last three points",No effort in conversation = no interest.  It sounds so simple right.  Yet I fall for this every damn time.  I make excuses in my head and I just end up falling for the same crap.  I book marked this by the way.  I think I will read it with each new ‚Äúfriend‚Äù I make. Thank you!
dating,nfpjw8,2021-05-18 23:24:38,"Believe people when they say ""I'm not looking for a relationship""","""I'm not looking for something serious"" and ""I'm not looking for a relationship"" are phrases I have heard many MANY times from past people I have gone on dates with. 

However, its as if what they said went in one ear and out the other. I have been guilty of trying to change them and convince them that they actually wanted a relationship with me.

That has never worked. When someone tells you this, you should take their word for it and move on. If you are interested in a relationship and they explicitly have told you that they are looking for something casual, it's not your job to try to change their mind.

No matter what I do, what I say, what I wear etc, they wouldn't change their mind. I have wasted countless nights crying over someone who had no interest in being in a relationship with me. 

If you're in a similar situation and you want a relationship, I would definitely advise you to listen to their words and actually believe them.","Although I feel that people overuse this line way too much. Most people if they met the right person would be open to a relationship. Instead of saying ""I'm not looking for a relationship,"" you should just say, ""I am not interested in you,"" which is more accurate."

Whenever I see guys vent here about how rough dating has been for them, I inevitably see someone telling him he‚Äôs throwing himself a pity party and that he needs to get over himself. 

Basically if a guy feels bad here he‚Äôs just told to man up. No one will just let the guy vent. But when a woman does this exact same things it‚Äôs flooded by people telling her that she never should settle and that the right man will come to her eventually.

Reposted from Casual Conversation after it was deleted for not fitting sub...


I (36F) have been single for a loooooong time. Nearly 12 years. I recently signed back up to Bumble. I joined last year but with the world the way it was, I deactivated my account in about May and decided that was that. My version of trying haha. 
Well today I went on my first date! I was so nervous. I somehow managed to tip my entire coffee over almost immediately, right into my shoes lol. But the date still went good. He was nice and funny and looked just like his pictures (bonus!) Haha. I had fun. 
AND he asked me on a second date! How exciting (and scary haha) Wish me luck!

Edit: ahh geez guys the love here is amazing. I appreciate all the well wishes and all the advice. I can't believe some have even given awards!! Thank you everyone. Xx","That's the kind of sweet stuff I like to read!

Wish you the best, you got this."
dating,guydj3,2020-06-02 02:07:55,"I want to be ok on my own, but it feels impossible when I long for romance and love","This feeling comes in waves. Some days, I‚Äôm happy with being single and enjoy the time to myself but on days like today, I feel completely miserable knowing that I am worthy of love but can‚Äôt have it. All I have ever wanted ever since I was a little girl was to love someone and be loved in return. I‚Äôve always been a hopeless romantic and was an amazing girlfriend to my ex but he wasnt to me; not even close. I‚Äôm just so depressed with how awful most of the guys I‚Äôve been with are. I‚Äôm torn between believing dating is hopeless, yet I remain hopeful that I‚Äôll meet the right person and keep this idealized vision of the man I want in my head and tell myself that he exists. All I think about lately is this man of my dreams whom I‚Äôve never met. It just hurts to not have that right now when I know I am more than enough.

Other days, I just want nothing to do with men and constantly lurk on this sub for hours at a time. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm trying to convince myself that I don‚Äôt want a man, when truthfully, I do. Either the guy I want is super attractive and a jerk, semi-attractive but a player, or average with mental illnesses (my ex-anger issues and violent tendencies). Probably dramatic, but these have been my personal experiences. Maybe part of it too is that I was with a toxic person for so many years and I just want someone who‚Äôs actually good for me.

How the hell can you be ok on your own when you‚Äôre a hopeless romantic who feels like they deserve a good guy?

**Update: Wow, you guys... I am in straight awe by the outpour of your responses and just want to thank all of you for taking the time to give me your support and sharing your stories. I have read every single post and am blown away. You've given me faith that hope is not lost and it can happen. There IS someone out there for me, and there's someone out there for you too. Like someone else said, the good ones get snatched up in the dating pool while the bad ones stay, and the dating scenes I approach like dating apps and bars do not attract the right men.** 

**Sometimes my mind spirals and I feel very caught up in the fantasy of love that I crave with someone. I had no idea anyone else out there felt this way too and honestly thought I was an outlier in my generation because no one my age talks about this. To the people who think I am needy for desiring a man, I actually do enjoy being single and feel liberated by how much it has allowed me to accomplish-I know I don't need a man but I do want love. I prefer being single over my previous relationship by a landslide. Thank you for ensuring me that this feeling is human and that there is hope out there. I really needed this today. <3**","I completely understand this thought pattern. For most of college, and about 50% of my twenties, I was the single friend. The third wheel. Always. When I decided I was tired of being single, I wanted a long-term partner so badly that this desire started to cloud my judgment. I began to set my expectations way too high when going out on dates with guys I didn‚Äôt know, and feeling devastated when things didn‚Äôt work out. I built these people up in my head. I was more excited about the prospect of being in a relationship than the stages of meeting someone and getting to know him. When guys used to show red-flag behavior (cancelling plans, ignoring texts, basically string me along), I used to persist after them anyway because I wanted to be in a relationship so badly. And allowing myself to be in relationships or situationships with people who blatantly disrespected me began to eat away my self-worth.

It doesn‚Äôt usually bring hope to you when well meaning friends in relationships say ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll happen for you, don‚Äôt worry!‚Äù But that really is the truth. If you are persistent in putting yourself out there, pulling back to collect yourself when it becomes too much, and engaging in self-reflection when things get tough, you‚Äôll achieve your goal of finding your person. He may not be the perfect man that you‚Äôve idealized in your head, but no one is perfect. Always trust your gut. If he‚Äôs the most attractive man you‚Äôve ever seen, but your gut is telling you he‚Äôs not right for other reasons, do some reflection on this gut feeling. Usually it‚Äôs always right. I wish I‚Äôd listened to mine more often. The longer you stay with someone who you know isn‚Äôt right for you, the longer it‚Äôll take for you to meet the right person."
dating,t5i39s,2022-03-03 03:32:33,WTF HAS HAPPENED TO DATING,"Okay I‚Äôm a attractive young female who recently discovered online dating and I wish I didn‚Äôt for the following reasons.

1.What happened to hello let me take you out? Why does everyone wanna ‚Äúchill‚Äù at their spot for first dates.

2. Why doesn‚Äôt anyone want a committed relationship anymore?! But wants sex!?!? (I‚Äôve made this clear on my profile)

3. Why for the love of Bob do people not want to talk on the phone anymore. It‚Äôs 10x quicker to make a connection and plans that way.

4.one more complaint, WHY ARE THERE SO MANY PEOPLE HOLDING DEAD FISH/DEER BLEEDING WHO FINDS THAT ATTRACTIVE? Usually accompanied by the 12 year old looking mustache.(I understand it‚Äôs your hobby but can‚Äôt you just have the line in the lake)

WTF IS GOING ON!?!? I‚Äôve tried bumble, hinge, and tinder.

Edit: Wow this blew up I think I should tell you guys things because y‚Äôall have a few questions.

1.I have my own place and car go to college online and work full time. So I think I scare away the guys because they might not have so much but I don‚Äôt judge them for it most people don‚Äôt at 19. I date from (19-25) I‚Äôm not super picky.

2.I work in a office and everyone there has at least 10 years on me. I can‚Äôt go to regular college things because my physical college is like a hour away.

3.I spent a lot of time with my grandparents growing up so that‚Äôs why I sound old.(Lol I get that a lot) I hear their cute dating stories and want that.

dating,sfj1zo,2022-01-29 14:20:25,Found a condom wrapper in BF‚Äôs bed(we don‚Äôt use it),"We have been dating for 3 years and I thought everything is going well and he is planning to move in. 
Last night we went on a date and everything went great. Went back to his place and ready to snuggle up and watch tv then I found this condom wrapper in between his top sheet and comforter. My heart sank and asked directly if he is having sex with someone else. He said no but couldn‚Äôt explain why there is a wrapper in his bed.  
As I got upset and getting ready to leave, he cried and swore he never had sex with anyone else while we are together. I am not sure if I should believe him. My brain tells me he is lying and there is no other way he could have a condom wrapper in his bed but my heart want to keep this 3 year relationship. Please help me with your fresh pair of eyes?

Update1: he lives alone and there is no other people can accessing his place.

Another episode I forgot to mentioned.  While we are talking about the wrapper, I asked him if he has other condoms (I want to see if they are the same). He looked and said he only has one box unopened.  I looked, it is different. However the expiration date at the bottom of the box says 2025. Considered we have been together for 3 years, when could he purchase this box with expiration of 2025? 

He did call while I was driving back and mentioned things like that he has been cleaning up his storage lately in preparation for the move in.  The wrapper might be from his storage stuff. So not sure what to think about that.

Update2: want to thank everyone for advice, support. Seems majority confirmed my gut feeling. It is just heartbreaking thinking that 3 years came to an end like such. Thinking back, there were other red flags (nothing concrete, but like being secretive with his phones, always put his phone done or away when I am around, etc.) 
Just sent him an email about not moving forward with the relationship and he can come get his stuff.",Maybe he hasn‚Äôt changed his sheets in three years. That is equally bad. Sorry!
dating,v5ivkc,2022-06-05 18:03:08,"I went to a stand up show for a date, got made fun, and then ended up crying in front of my date.","
It was my 4th date with her and I really liked her and enjoyed seeing her but now I‚Äôm fucked.

So she had the idea to go to a stand up event where different amateur comics came up and did their set. 3 out of 5 of the comments made me a part of their routine. They all just went in on me for the way I looked, dressed, and constantly made it a point that the girl I was seeing was out of my league. One asked how much I payed for her to be my date.

I tried to be good natured about it. I tried to not let it get to me. But honestly my self esteem is such shit anyways and I couldn‚Äôt help to take everything they said personally because all of it was true. I ended up crying by the time the last comic came up and the girl noticed and said that we should leave.

I dropped her off and I tried texting her apologizing for ruining the date and I haven‚Äôt gotten a response.

I‚Äôm such a fucking loser.","Wow, sounds like the first one made some good hearted jokes and then the others just tried to piggy back off of it, because they didn't have any good material of their own. It's not you, if the first one went on someone else, the others would of ganged up on them instead of you, but you were just unlucky in that moment.

dating,rmgt6s,2021-12-22 22:43:17,I just found out my boyfriends porn preference and don‚Äôt know how to feel,"I (30f) found out my boyfriends (36m) porn preference is women with penises. We‚Äôve been together 7 months. I had to look up something so I went to his browser and saw it in the opened tabs. I didn‚Äôt say anything though. I am a straight woman with a vagina and have never dealt with anything like this. I don‚Äôt want to kink shame but I am also really confused and afraid he still has things to work out with his sexuality and it will end up hurting me. Is this something that is legitimate to be concerned about or should I just forget it and accept that people get off on lots of things I don‚Äôt understand?

Edit: After reading through a bunch of comments, I decided to look up futanari (sp?) porn to see what it was. It wasn‚Äôt bad and it led me to looking at porn of women with giant clits. I already liked watching women masturbate because I like imagining how it feels which is what gets me off. This was like watching what I already liked amplified. It really turned me tf on lol. Instead of telling my bf straight up what I saw him looking at, I shared with him that I enjoyed watching women with large clits masturbate. He said he enjoyed the same and we had a bonding moment over it. He didn‚Äôt say anything about the other stuff I saw, but I don‚Äôt need him to. You guys comments helped open my mind a lot to the situation and I don‚Äôt feel weird or confused anymore. Even better, he and I had the best sex we‚Äôve had thus far today. Everyone wins!

I've (26F) been out of a 3 year relationship for a bit and honestly was dreading dating again. I worked on myself for a bit then felt like I was ready to jump back in the scene. Met a super cute dude on Bumble. Never thought I would be on a dating app, mind you. But we matched and had been texting for while. I felt like he wasn't picking up that I was interested. I can come off too friendzone-ish I think. So I pumped myself up in the kitchen, did the Shia Lebeouf Just Do It routine, and asked him out on a date. And he said yes with an exclamation mark :) Hopefully it goes well! 

Keep pushing you beautiful humans! JUST DO IT!","Guys get turned down all the time if they ask. If the girl show interest, the guy is obviously interested too if he is texting you. Just ask them out.

dating,cjbzwi,2019-07-29 14:30:46,Can we stop normalizing ghosting as a part of modern dating and recognize that it‚Äôs a completely unacceptable thing to do to someone?,"You see so many posts/articles  talking about how it‚Äôs common in modern dating, focusing on the victims and talking about how much it hurt... but where are the folks who are ANGRY?? You know, the way we are when someone cheats? We get PISSED!! 

It‚Äôs not that different from cheating. It leaves you wondering why you weren‚Äôt good enough for that person. You feel used, disrespected, insulted and indignant. And IT‚ÄôS NOT OKAY. 

JUST GROW THE FUCK UP AND SAY HOW YOU FEEL, PEOPLE. IT‚ÄôS NOT THAT HARD!!!!

And if you‚Äôve been ghosted.. don‚Äôt let them get away with it and don‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs your fault in some way... GET PISSED!!

EDIT: 

Taking this from one of my comments to clear this up: It‚Äôs upsetting that people are misunderstanding what I was trying to say but this is it. Im not trying to control other people like some commenters are saying because here‚Äôs the thing: if this guy were to message me and tell me that this wasn‚Äôt working for him anymore for one reason or another, I would understand! And I would say so! And sure not everyone would react to that rejection maturely, but like (one commenter) said you can‚Äôt control that. You can only do your best to be honest, mature, and respectful yourself. Not everyone is going to do the same, and if they don‚Äôt... good riddance. You did your part and you don‚Äôt have to have them in your life anymore. But the reality is that most people are going to understand. Most people have experienced rejection before and can handle it, but honesty and communication makes that a lot easier to process.

The person who ghosted me invited me to his cousin‚Äôs wedding and said he wanted a relationship in the future. We slept together multiple times, spent multiple full days together and had a ton of fun, and we talked about how surprised we were by how much we ended up liking each other. Then he disappeared. So no, I‚Äôm not talking about some Tinder date you never met that stopped messaging you. 

And yes, cheating is a different level of betrayal. I have been cheated on and I know how traumatizing it can be. I‚Äôm sorry if that comparison offended some people but what I meant was that being ghosted is degrading in a similar way.

EDIT 2: Also weird that everyone assumes I‚Äôm talking about online dating tbh. I was ghosted by someone I was in a relationship with for 6 months, someone who I knew from junior high in my hometown aka real life. Currently being ghosted by a guy I met in college.

EDIT 3: Also I‚Äôm a woman. Not an incel or whatever as people seem to assume. Sooooo there‚Äôs that.","It makes me incredibly angry but to a degree I understand why people do it so it curbs my anger marginally.  So many people react like a 4 year old when they are turned down, cussing, screaming, insulting; they can‚Äôt handle being rejected.  So instead of rolling the dice and hoping this person isn‚Äôt a lunatic they choose to take a less confrontational albeit rude, path."

Since then she kind of got too close with me we had lot of deep conversation and connect. I did know that she was seeing other men as well and I was fine with it. 

One fine day she says I love you and she was like she's in the track to get exclusive and marry me. And she said she wanted to end things with the other person who she was seeing and she said she's going out with him and will end it then.
I kind of was sceptical about it, but I was agreed to it. Apparantly she didn't know where she was going to meet him, but she had gone to his place. Had couple of drinks with him, got high and that man made a move and she said she resisted it twice but third time in the heat of the moment she gave into it. She didn't think about our relationship then cuz she was high.

I was taken aback with the entire thing. I genuinely wanted this relationship to go somewhere. But now that she hurt me I kind of lost. She's coming behind me begging to give her another chance. She said she will make things work out. I am not able to decide on what I want to do.",Why would you drink and get high with someone if you were planning on ending it?
dating,gxyg0x,2020-06-06 20:29:11,"If I don't need a relationship to be happy, why does being single hurt so much?","Every time I think about being single and my frustrations with dating my mind crosses the advice that everyone gives, talking about how I should be happy with myself first and that I shouldn't be looking for a relationship for the sake of having one.

But there's this constant sensation of emptiness and sadness every time these thoughts come up and I just wish I still had someone to call a partner and I constantly wonder if I'm in the wrong or if I truly need some form of companionship. It feels like these two narratives in my head are constantly fighting and it leaves me feeling drained and incredibly depressed.","You‚Äôre allowed to want a relationship. It‚Äôs normal to desire connection and intimacy, and a partner. We‚Äôre social creatures - we aren‚Äôt designed to be isolated and alone forever. 

The point is to make sure you have self-worth and *can* be happy on your own, so you don‚Äôt become *dependent* on someone else to make you happy. If you depend on a partner to complete you, you start sacrificing your wants and needs and not laying boundaries in order to put them first, and you lose your identity. 

Basically, it‚Äôs okay to WANT a relationship, we all do! You just should be mindful of not feeling like you NEED one. It makes life better, it just can‚Äôt be your only reason to live, y‚Äôknow?"

If you bench a lot or dominate a sport, bring up only that you do it, then let her find out on her own from Instagram/whatever how impressive you are.

dating,i2wi31,2020-08-03 12:53:34,People who ask you on a date but don't actually form out any sort of plan.,"I've (26F) gotta say, it's become one of my biggest pet peeves as of lately. When I do get asked on a date, we get to the day of it and the person is sitting there twittling their thumbs about what we should go do. That, or they try to default it onto me to make the plans or decide what we are doing.

I feel like if you're asking someone on a date, it would make sense that you formulate a plan and are prepared for the day of.  Maybe that's just me though.","As a 25M, my pattern is now absolutely always just to engage in conversation until someone brings up something we both enjoy, and then I start spitballing hypotheticals, or I pepper these kinds of questions in beforehand, ideally organically, during the conversation: Do you have a favorite time of day? What‚Äôs your schedule like? Have you ever been to this place before?

Then whenever I actually know when I‚Äôll be free, have gas in my car and it‚Äôs clean, and have all my basic needs met, I can just shoot out a ‚ÄúWould you be interested in meeting at X on Y day to do Z?‚Äù and the answer has a good chance to be a yes with maybe minor modifications to the specifics. 

If I were to ask somebody on a date before I figured out all that stuff, it would force me to sort of either aggressively pester them to try to get information that would help me plan a good date in time, which can absolutely backfire, or just have them choose (I wouldn‚Äôt say this is lazy, but it is sort of walking uphill against the current of heteronormative expectations which is just unnecessarily troublesome sometimes IMO). 

A decision like that to me is putting the cart before the horse, and basically no strong skills in order of operations. I know spontaneity is important to a lot of people, but in my mind a focused intention and sufficient internal cost/benefit analysis and operational risk assessment skills are things I want from a partner. If they don‚Äôt have that stuff I don‚Äôt really want them involved with me as more than acquaintances."
dating,xxq1v8,2022-10-07 04:54:51,Just deleted all dating apps,"I'm not giving up on dating, I'm just sick of the toxic culture that online dating seems to perpetuate between all sexes and genders. It makes me sick to see how we date now, I was getting matches and nothing of substance was ever talked about, on top of that you have fake accounts that constantly hit me (I'm male) to buy nudes, to get on only fans, to add an insta account, or some sugar daddy bullshit that just makes me physically gag.

Then when you do match with someone legit, it's like talking to a brick wall. For fucks sake I've had better conversations with bots. I'm not saying these people aren't wonderful people looking for something good in their lives but the online dating scene is a sick puppy and doesn't really condone good conversation or getting to know each other. It's a meat grinder for both parties for different reasons.

Almost all my relationships have been found actually talking to someone, not texting or looking at a profile that doesn't allow barely any sort of information regarding the person. Instead it's quick one liners and tags. None of which really builds up to anything remotely needed to decide if I like the person or not.

It's toxic as fuck, and I'm over it. I'd rather wait it out and find someone I mesh well with doing something worth my time and not being detrimental to my opinion of other human beings.",[deleted]

What I learned is, if someone says this to you, I need to take it at face value. There is one of two reasons why someone would say that. The first reason is that they are only looking for something physical and they know that if you have repeat ‚Äúhang outs,‚Äù the other party has a higher chance of catching feelings. They want to prevent that conversation in the future about defining the relationship and they don‚Äôt want to be the bad guy. They can say ‚ÄúI told you from the start I didn‚Äôt want a relationship.‚Äù
 
The second reason why someone would say this is because they are not interested in a relationship with you. What this means is, they don‚Äôt see you as a match. They would be interested in a relationship but you don‚Äôt have the qualities they want. Don‚Äôt take it to heart because that just means this wasn‚Äôt the right pairing. However, do leave the situation if you are, in fact, looking for a relationship.
 
Even though I know this, it can be hard to remember this!!!","Yup! Just walked away yesterday from someone who wanted to ‚Äúdate casual‚Äù it was an adult conversation filled with mutual respect about what we both want.

dating,ov5wtm,2021-07-31 12:01:39,Can people explain to me why I see a disturbing amount of early 20's just giving up?,"This is a disturbing trend I've noticed lately that always plays out the same way. Early 20 something man or woman has never been in a relationship before. Hits the gym all the time and puts themselves out there only to strike out. Becomes jaded and just gives up on dating.

Now I'm not sure if this is because these people listen to a bunch of these narcissistic podcasts about ""winning"" the dating game, only to find out that none of this shit actually works in real life or if it's something else entirely.

But come on! Get your head out of the sand and open your eyes! You're in your 20s. The world isn't going to end tomorrow and even if it did there is still going to be men and women living in the world. 

Every one of these people has such a doom and gloom attitude that I seriously think what they need is therapy, not a relationship. 

I'm directly addressing any of these people who read this post now. If you enter a relationship with anyone looking for happiness while thinking absolute dirt about yourself then you will never find the happiness you seek. You'll always be forever chasing the phantom of your own fantasy and never catching it.

Work on yourself first. Your mental health more than your physical health because like it or not, hitting the gym every day and training yourself into the mortal incarnation of Adonis or Aphrodite will not instantly turn you into a relationship magnet.

Now if doing exactly that is what changes your opinions of yourself and makes you happy with yourself than all power to you but for those of you who this doesn't work for I have one thing to say.

Seek your happiness in something else.

Grow your skills, take up something creative where you can see your progression. Learn to cook decent meals for yourself and others. Join a community for your hobby and talk with people about it.

And if all else fails. Talk to a bloody therapist because whatever issues you've got going on won't be magically solved by dating someone.

The world out there is sucks. It's full of shitty, manipulative people who don't give a shit about you. It's full of governments and corporations neck deep in shady shit that we don't even know the half of. It's a world where only the top 1% who are born with silver spoons in their mouths have anything handed to them on a gold plated silver platter. The rest of us have to sweat, and struggle, and claw, and fight our way to anything. Education, careers, relationships. It's all a constant battle that we have to fight every single day.

It's a world where giving up *ISN'T* an option. And if you give up on anything and everything just because you can't get a boyfriend or a girlfriend at f***ing 20 then you need some serious help.

It's disappointing to see people my age (23m) just flat out giving up life and love because they can't get a date. I didn't have a girlfriend until I was 21 and that relationship recently fell apart so now I'm back to being single again. I've waded into the dating pool knowing that I'm probably not going to get anything for quite a while and I've been proven right. Has it made me give up? No. Because I still want to find a girlfriend that I can take on dates and do all the things I did with my last gf and maybe even settle down with them.

Giving up doesn't solve your problems. It just makes more of them.","* Constantly rejected
* Zero matches
* Ghosted
* Vilified as a creep if an approach goes wrong
* Basically invisible to most women
* No good places to meet decent women
* Constant pressure to improve, impress and approach 
* You're always going to be more replaceable 
* Height is scrutinised 
* Can't stand out because she has too many options
* Constant feeling of inadequacy
* Society demonises you
* Work so much that you're too exhausted to bother

dating,hv0tvz,2020-07-21 04:26:44,Being cheated on has changed a lot of things,"It has changed:

1. My perspective on dating. I no longer think that if I put maximum effort and make them my priority that they will stay faithful. I have learned that it does not work that way. I use to be able to sit back and enjoy my relationships. Enjoy my time with that person. It does not work that way. Their feelings could change any second.

2. My perspective on women. I use to think that it was only the guys who cheat. I did not think many women cheated until I started to date. Women are just as bad as guys in many ways. Women leave guys for the same reasons guys leave women. For example if a guy is dating a girl and she is bad at sex or she is not meeting his sexual needs he cheats or bails. Women are guilty of the same thing. I don‚Äôt hold women to a higher standard than guys anymore. 

3. It has changed me. This is a mixed bag. I‚Äôm grateful for the things I went through because they made me stronger and I learned a lot about myself, women, and dating but it has shattered my confidence. I question things more than ever now. Am I doing this right, am I saying the right things, am I good looking enough, etc.  


If you have a significant other who busts their ass to make you happy the worst thing you can do to is cheat on them. That is such a confidence killer. It‚Äôs been 2 years and my confidence still has not recovered. Not only that it hurts like hell. 

If you are seeing someone and you are not sure about them don‚Äôt rush it. Date them a bit longer before making it official. 

If you are not ready to cut ties completely with your FWB you should not be dating. If you want a successful relationship certain sacrifices such as cutting ties with exes and FWB need to happen. If you want to hook up and sleep around that‚Äôs fine but if someone wants something serious please be honest with them. Do not waste their time.",There's a special place in hell for cheaters.

dating,kv3xru,2021-01-11 14:42:38,Wish I had known this in my 20's,"(tldr in bold at the bottom)

In my 20's, I was so blinded by my emotions and busy with work, I never had a chance to figure out what was really going on in the dating world.  I wish I knew that, for most people, your 20s are all about finding out what you need for lasting happiness.  That fact explains so much behavior that I felt was unfair.

When most people date, they are exploring their possible futures.  They are answering questions like:
- What does an ideal relationship look and feel like?
- What kind of people can I like/love and what kind of people like/love me?
- What future lifestyles are open to me based on my romantic partner?

These questions take *years* to answer, and people spend years or decades finding the answers because nowadays no one needs to have children to work the farm for their survival.  People want to be *certain* that they know who they are and that they are getting the best life possible for themselves.  And eventually, having identified their picture of success, they try to find and live that life, probably sometime in their 30s.  Women who want children need to work especially hard in their 20s because, if you want a kid by 35, you need to be married by 34, so you need to be engaged by 33, in a relationship with your future life partner by 31-32, so you need to know exactly what you want by age 30-31, and so on.  That's tough!  That explains why women often drop guys at any time if the slightest thing feels off.  They are racing to find what they are looking for.

I remember so many times I was angry/sad after being ghosted or rudely mistreated, but I was only looking at what was immediately in front of me, not the whole future of the other person/myself.  It wasn't until I was in my early 30s when I realized the importance of shaping your long term future lifestyle.  I think women realized that importance much earlier than I did.

**If I could re-do my 20's, I'd focus on the idea that people are trying to find themselves, and that I should let go of my ego and do what I can to help them on their journey, without expecting them to fall in love with me and live happily ever after.**  The ""love"" part can happen, and it can sadly not be enough, and that's okay!  I was so greedy, it was like I wanted to sink my teeth into people I liked and hold onto them for dear life, but that just led to frustration and disappointment.  I'd also try harder to shape myself.  At the time, I was just floating around, trying to make money, with no goal other than survival and getting some sex.  I should have spent more effort figuring myself out, learning about and trying new lifestyles and types of relationships.  That way, I'd know the kind of partner I could be for someone.",How would you go about helping other people find themselves / try new lifestyles or relationships?

Yet, he kept messaging. And messaging. Then there‚Äôd be a break. Then he‚Äôd text again. This went on for 8 months.

He didn‚Äôt ghost because of lack of compatibility, part of why this super sucks. It‚Äôs just, why continue talking to someone after dating (he had asked me on a fourth, which was pending @ time of ghosting) if you‚Äôre just going to vanish? At least make a grand exit.

dating,jlltht,2020-10-31 16:56:52,30 signs that someone isn‚Äôt interested or is half heartedly interested in you. How to avoid being a passing time candidate,"

We ignore what are often blatant signs of disinterest.

This is all on the basis of a couple of things: they‚Äôre still ‚Äòthere‚Äô in some capacity and we assume they have ‚Äòsome‚Äô interest that can be made into ‚Äòmore‚Äô.

Cue trying to prove ourselves, seeking validation and attempting to avoid rejection. One of the things that we must do, and by we, I mean both men and women because these issues affect everyone, is recognise when someone is not interested or is ‚Äòvanilla‚Äô in their interest.

The key really isn‚Äôt to get into splitting hairs about what level of interest they have, because it all boils down to that they‚Äôre either in or they‚Äôre out, and they‚Äôre either treating you decently, or they‚Äôre not. If any of the following signs of disinterest are in your relationship, I‚Äôd take a parachute and jump because all 30 of these either on their own or joined up with others, make for an unhealthy partnering. You deserve better. Don‚Äôt sell yourself short.

Recognise signs of disinterest so that you don‚Äôt allow someone to ‚Äòpass time‚Äô with you.

1. They‚Äôre not contacting you or are sporadically contacting you.
2. They may not even bother speaking with you and rely predominantly on emails, text messages, and instant messenger.
3. They treat you like an option.
4. They don‚Äôt want to put both of their feet in and commit. They‚Äôd like you to ‚Äògo with the flow‚Äô even if there is nothing flowing, and to expect nothing beyond this.
5. The relationship doesn‚Äôt progress ‚Äì it goes in fits and starts, stalls, or goes into reverse.
6. They‚Äôre keeping you a secret.
7. They tend to be around/call you up when they want something. It might be money, attention, an ego stroke, sex, an armchair psychologist, but if you think back to all the times when you‚Äôve heard from them, you may notice that it was a preamble to something.
8. They leave it to the last minute/short notice to make plans. They may not even bother to make last minute plans ‚Äì they might just show up late at night expecting you to be around. Don‚Äôt be.
9. They create drama in the hope that you‚Äôll take the hint that they‚Äôre not interested and end it, so that they can be let off the hook
10. When you‚Äôre broken up with them, they get in touch, often in a lazy manner just to ensure that you still jump to their beat. In fact, take the fact that you‚Äôre not in a relationship with them as a major sign of disinterest. Don‚Äôt make the mistake of thinking that they got in touch because they want to get back together.
11. They‚Äôll make a lot of noise when you attempt to move on with someone else and then when you ‚Äòreciprocate‚Äô, they‚Äôre nowhere to be seen.
12. They send text messages, emails, or leave voicemails, and when you no doubt eagerly respond, they either take ages to or don‚Äôt bother at all.
13. They don‚Äôt break up with their wife/husband/girlfriend/boyfriend. But they still expect to be with you. Hell, they seem to think you have all the time in the frickin‚Äô world to be waiting around for them.
14. They don‚Äôt get that divorce finalised. In fact, they may even pretend they‚Äôve started proceedings!
15. They keep blaming timing, the no 5 bus, work, their ex, their commitment issues, or whatever the excuse du jour is, for why they can‚Äôt be or do something. In fact, they keep making excuses.
16. They‚Äôre sporadic in their efforts, and you can often pin bursts of efforts to when you either told them to beat it or they felt in danger of losing you.
17. They keep changing their mind about their interest in you. Flip-flapper alert!
18. They talk incessantly about themselves while not really taking an interest in you. OR‚Ä¶ they deflect conversations away from details about themselves and try to focus on you.
19. They tell you that they love you but they‚Äôre not in love with you, that they‚Äôre not ready for a relationship, they‚Äôre not the right person for you, that they‚Äôre a ‚Äòbad person‚Äô, ‚Äòout of your league‚Äô, that you‚Äôre ‚Äòtoo good‚Äô for them and other such things that basically say, ‚ÄúI have limited interest in you‚Äù.
20. They sleep with other people while sleeping with you.
21. They only have a sexual interest in you.
22. It takes them weeks or even months to call you up after a date or taking your number.
23. You‚Äôre hanging out like friends. You may even be friends with benefits.
24. They disappear for periods of time.
25. They‚Äôre more interested in having things their way, on their terms, being right, and having the power.
26. They treat you without love, care, trust, and respect. Even if you don‚Äôt love one another yet, it shouldn‚Äôt stop them from being a respectful person with integrity that cares about their actions and those around them.
27. They treat everyone from the old lady down the street, to the postman, the dog and whoever else has no romantic expectations of them with decency, but when it comes to you, they‚Äôre an assclown.
28. They‚Äôre either Future Avoiders, afraid to talk about the future or make plans, or they‚Äôre Future Fakers, faking a future so they can get what they want in the present, because they know they won‚Äôt be around in the future, because they‚Äôre not genuinely interested.
29. They are controlling, manipulative, jealous and possessive. These are not signs that they‚Äôre actually interested in you ‚Äì these are signs that they want to control you. This is not the same as love or as a result of love. A person who behaves in this way isn‚Äôt the type to have a balanced, respectful relationship, and may not even really want you but won‚Äôt want anyone else to have you either.
30. They‚Äôre so ‚Äòbusy‚Äô, they have no time for the relationship. Nobody is that busy and when someone is genuinely interested they find the time.

These thirty signs indicate that they‚Äôre ‚Äòjust not that into you.‚Äò They‚Äôre also signs of emotional unavailability that are likely to also point to a frustrating and/or painful dating cycle.

When someone‚Äôs genuinely interested in you, they consistently demonstrate their interest and leave you in no doubt about it.

They and the relationship are not ambiguous, they‚Äôre not afraid to make plans and follow through on them, and more importantly, they treat you with care, trust, respect, and eventually love consistently. They don‚Äôt burn up their energies resisting you and you don‚Äôt burn up your time and energy making excuses for them and seeing meaning where there is no meaning.

When someone is not interested, it doesn‚Äôt mean that they won‚Äôt stick around for the fringe benefits, especially if it becomes apparent that regardless of how poorly they behave, that you will still be there.

There are others who are a half-hearted, a bit ‚Äòmeh‚Äô, and actually vanilla in their interest, in that they think you‚Äôre ‚Äònice‚Äô or whatever but you‚Äôre not ‚ÄòThe One‚Äô or even in danger of becoming ‚ÄòThe One‚Äô. Sometimes they flat out know this, but maybe because they‚Äôre not genuinely looking for a ‚ÄòThe One relationship‚Äô ‚Äì possibly because they‚Äôre avoiding commitment ‚Äì you will do to pass time with. Some people overestimate their interest, then realise that they‚Äôre not as interested as they thought, and either think they might rediscover that interest again (probably not), or that again, you‚Äôre good to pass time with. Of course if something better comes along, they‚Äôll be out of there.

Don‚Äôt sell you short, and if the relationship and your interest isn‚Äôt mutual, flush before you lose your dignity and self-esteem.

You cannot be available for an available relationship if you‚Äôre making yourself available to someone who is unavailable.

dating,hue77n,2020-07-20 03:36:11,I feel like the biggest barrier to achieving a relationship is lack of communication skills.,"No one talks things out anymore. Over the phone or in-person.

Texting is a shitty way to bond and empathize.

dating,iuim1c,2020-09-17 12:38:35,"Y'all should date each other, all the reddit peoples","Everytime I come on reddit, there is always a post where a person in-between the ages of 26 and 32 is lamenting on their dating life and how they can't find someone. All those people in all those posts should go on dates with each other or talk.
They would find someone with their tastes!!! 

Same with other age groups. If all the people who made the posts saying that they were lonely and had no luck in dating got together, they would totally find someone.

dating,ikrnxl,2020-09-01 20:02:24,Extremely weird Tinder date experience,"Hey everyone. I‚Äôve been online dating for a while. I‚Äôve had some interesting experiences but none quite like this before. I just wanted to share with everyone what happened on this crazy date.

About 2 weeks ago I matched with this girl on tinder. She was really cool and fun to talk to at first and we hit it off pretty well. She was funny and had an interesting sense of humor. She was very attractive. Nothing struck me as weird or odd about her appearance really. She had a lot of tattoos which I liked a lot. There were certain comments that she would make at times that just seemed to be pretty dark and morbid. Another thing I found to be weird was that she insisted on driving. I figured that it was because she had a nice car and wanted to show it off. Nope. When she came to get me she pulled up in a pretty beat up, dark brown van. When I got in i noticed an awful smell. It was very messy with trash and dirty clothes everywhere. I didn‚Äôt want to say anything about it so I just made casual conversation. We went out to eat which was normal for the most part. After we left she said that she wanted to drive me to this one spot she likes to go. She said that it was secluded and deep in the woods so I figured it was just to make out or something like that. 

When we got there she got out of the van and ran off sprinting. I was so confused and in shock at this point. I looked around for her for a second but it was pretty dark and creepy so I just decided to get back into the van and lock the doors. A few minutes later I heard beating on the windows. It was really loud and scary. It did appear to be her so I opened the door to let her in. She was completely naked at this point. I gave her a confused look and she said that she just ran off like that to freak me out. She kept laughing and then started kissing me. I went along with it even though I was a little freaked out. I don‚Äôt want to share graphic details but she requested me to do some really weird and odd things that I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable doing. I finally had to tell her to stop and that I wasn‚Äôt comfortable doing anymore. She told me to get out of the van. I asked if she could drive me back home but instead she shoved me out and left me there and drove off. 

I still had my phone so I decided to call the police. I let them know where I was and that I felt unsafe. They shortly arrived and I told them what happened. While I was taking to them she came back in her van. They talked her to her and said that they were going to take her in. The next day I got a long message berating me for calling the cops on her. She said that what I did was uncalled for and childish. After talking to her I did realiZe it was just to be funny.",Bruh WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK. Please report this girl on whatever dating app you have. The next time she might not just push a guy out the van and run off. If you have the police report of the DC number please link that to the app report site. She  is nuts.

Because it‚Äôs so real.","I just realized that at least in my case, this clich√© is absolutely true. With every person I‚Äôve dated, the more I play it cool and don‚Äôt show too much excitement about seeing them in general, the greater the chances of them wanting to see me and to lead into a relationship.
And it bugs me the most because sometimes I just wanna be straightforward and really show how happy and excited I am about certain someone, but that generally leads to them losing all interest. Playing it cool sucks but also works. Why is this? Is it ingrained in our culture? What‚Äôs going on?",F here and I feel you. Happens to me every fucking time. Why why whyy!!!!
dating,lhqls4,2021-02-11 18:07:37,"I like this girl but she's pretty big, like really tall and strong (Former cop and does MMA). I really like her though, but it's a little weird.","I grew up in a family where i was taught to be masculine and protect your partner. Man protects the woman, but this girl i've been talking to and am interested in. I call her ""My Amazoness"", she's really tall and broad shouldered for a lady, a former cop and actively practices in amateur boxing and mma.

I've seen her wrestle other women and she usually dominates the match. I like her but am kinda intimidated by her, i'm a short guy (5'8"") and don't really exercise much. She could probably break me in half. She's a real sweetheart though when she's not in the ring. It kinda hurts my masculinity, because i can't help but think if something like a mugger comes up and tries to rob us, she'd be the one to protect me.

But i still want to pursue something with her, even though it's kinda weird for there to be such a gap in power.

I know she's into me, she invited me to the gym with her to spectate her match.","Firstly, you find her attractive. She finds you attractive. Who cares about outdated masculinity standards.

Secondly, protecting her isn't limited to fighting off imaginery muggers. You're much more likely to need to be there to protect her emotionally from all the obstacles life throws at her, *that's* when you'll prove yourself to be a man. Or if you end up having kids together and become a great, reliable father. That's being masculine, not having big muscles and scaring off fictional monsters."
dating,1235jss,2023-03-27 00:40:22,Went to a guys place last night and I thought I was going to get murdered.,"I‚Äôve met this guy once before and there was no real red flags. He invited me over so I agreed. He lived in a relatively nice part of town in richy condos. As I‚Äôm walking through the hallway I‚Äôm like omg, this seems like the last place ima see alive‚Ä¶ I get in his apartment and he doesn‚Äôt turn any lights on and says his roommate is sleeping on the couch (who he told me earlier wasn‚Äôt even home) we get to his room and it‚Äôs‚Ä¶ disgusting. There‚Äôs dishes with old food in them everywhere moldy beer bottles, old fast food, etc. I‚Äôm surprised it didn‚Äôt have a smell. On top of all that there was clothes everywhere. His bathroom was attached to his room and I took a glance in there and almost vomited. The toilet was so dirty it looked like it hasn‚Äôt been cleaned since 1976. ü§¢ his sheets however were clean but he has ‚Äúgirly‚Äù pillows like throw pillows. On the floor was a pink womans sock. So I‚Äôm like, okay a woman has been here before. He starts counting money and lights up a joint. Then he offers to just lay in bed and listen to music I‚Äôm like okay, I didn‚Äôt wanna be rude and be like yeah I‚Äôm leaving. 

Fast forward an hour he gets up and snorts a line of coke. Told me he‚Äôs on probation for a OVI and takes some pills. Got back in bed and was cuddling and he started kissing me. I was so turned off at this point. He could barely keep his eyes open I was worried he was about to OD or something. He gets up and snorts 5 more lines of Coke and says ‚Äúoh I‚Äôm sorry, did you want some?‚Äù Bruh. No. He proceeds to tell me he doesn‚Äôt have a problem and hands me a stack of 100s and asks me to count them. I‚Äôm like nah I‚Äôm good. He was just acting so weird and awkwardly aggressive sometimes. I‚Äôm like, yup I‚Äôm getting murdered. 

At this point I‚Äôm looking for an escape route so I tell him it‚Äôs super late and I think ima go home. He proceeds to do like 3 more lines of Coke and take more pills. He puts coke in his wallet and tells me he‚Äôs going to the casino. 

This was the second time I met this man.. wtf when I got home I looked at a public clerk of courts docket only to find out this guy has gotten 2 OVIs, a possession of coke charge, a domestic violence charge, and some speeding tickets and whatnot. I think I really dodged a bullet there.",‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt wanna be rude‚Äù. This is exactly the type of thinking that gets women killed. Not an understatement. There was a study on serial killers and this is what they themselves pointed out. They didn‚Äôt bother with rude women because they were too much trouble. The nice ones that wanted to help or not be perceived as rude were their prey. I‚Äôm glad you got out but please leave as soon as you feel the vibe is off
dating,nqwxme,2021-06-02 21:31:37,"There's a difference between needing a relationship, and wanting one, and we need to talk about it.","Because honestly, surely there are lots of people who feel like they need a relationship to feel complete, but I think there's also a lot of people out there who don't. I don't see a reason why there's still this sort of ""shame"" attached to admitting you want a relationship. Or doing online dating to get into one.

When I (22f) take myself for example, I've been single for three years now. I've dated a little on and off though, tomorrow I'm having a third date with a guy that I met online, and I'm having a blast. But I'm not going to break down if it ends, either. I just think dating is fun, and a great way to meet new people, even if it doesn't lead anywhere.

I have my life where I want it to be. I'm having lots of fun exploring my career options, even though I sometimes stress the hell out when I can't figure it out. I talk to my friends about it, and don't feel like I'm missing out because I don't have a partner to tell. I sometimes wish I had a partner when I see my friends in great relationships, but the thought of it doesn't consume me at all. I have hobbies that I fill up my time with. Alone, and loving it. I imagine my future by myself, in my own little apartment, with a dog or a cat, and I don't see a problem with it. Hell, I'd love that even. I can imagine exactly what I'd want to do with a year if I had to be single the entire time. So I feel like life is fun either with or without a partner, however I still feel like it would be even *better* with someone to share it with.

And I feel like many, many people feel the same way I do, yet like me, feel ashamed to (actively) look for a relationship and being open about it. Can we all just have a chat about it, and admit it's perfectly fine and natural to want a relationship for all the right reasons?

Also: feeling like you *need* a relationship doesn't mean you're a bad person or that there's anything wrong with you. Take your alone time. Heal. Life is good, and you'll get there. ‚ù§Ô∏è

Edit: a word.

Edit II: okay, maybe we don't *need* to talk about it, haha. I just wanted to talk about it! Also, wow, I didn't expect this to ""blow up"" like it did. Thank you all so much for the awards and your replies. I had fun reading what y'all had to say and got some very interesting points of view. Might not have responded to everyone, but I see you!

Also, I saw a few comments saying that I may be too young to understand ""the other side"", and maybe you're right. But I know lots of people older than me that are perfectly content being single, and also people my age that feel very needy towards a relationship. Though granted, I don't know what it's like to be single later in life, and I can only speak from my own experiences.",I don't need a relationship. But I want one. I took the time to heal and sure maybe I have more healing to do. But I don't need a relationship.

Please and thanks","I think an important thing to realize is that we are in a wild west period of dating. Online dating is completely ubiquitous and probably the default method of meeting people. This was NOT the case even 10 years ago. 

We are going through a period of profound and radical change. I was listening to some podcast, and the interviewee was saying ""had the dating app explosion happened in the 1960s historians would be writing books about it for decades"". But its not just the dating app explosion, its the social media explosion, cryptocurrency, covid, virtual reality etc etc.

She was quiet and pretty shy but she was always sweet to me and would help my dumbass in english and spanish. We did not have much in common at all. I was the class clown, talked to everyone, I played baseball through college and high school and she would sit in class, do her work and when she was finished would pull out her book and read. We ended up becoming friends in class, I would make it a thing to make her laugh on purpose and talk more. I had a big crush on her but I didn‚Äôt do anything about it. I thought I was too dumb to be her type. Maybe she liked more smart guys, you know? I saw her at prom but she didn‚Äôt take a date, she was with her friends, I said hi and we talked for a big but that was it. You‚Äôre probably thinking east, you‚Äôre an idiot, I know! I know!

She‚Äôs even more stunning and so I walk over to her and say ‚Äúhey remember me? dumb baseball player you helped graduated.‚Äù She gasped and hugged me saying ‚Äúyou were never dumb! how the hell are you?‚Äù

I feel so dumb for falling for this and even sending the selfie she was too into me and too forward. I'm just really stressed now and feel like giving up trying to date forever and wipe my existence off the internet.

dating,p1u9jx,2021-08-10 17:42:17,I just found out my guy did something so respectfull before we even started dating and even talking,"When I met him I was in a (dying) relationship. I met him at my job, so sometimes we talked, but never a lot. Apparently he already liked me back then, but he saw on my facebook that I was in a relationship, so he just didn't try anything. Not a single move or anything. 

When I quit working at that place he needed to know something, so he messaged me trough facebook. That's when he found out I wasn't in a relationship anymore, and that's when he started seriously making moves. 

I know it should be normal that people don't make moves at someone who's in a relationship, but honestly? The amount of people that tried hitting me up knowing full well I was in a relationship of over 2 years astonishes me. 

He told me this today when we talked about the first time we seriously started talking. Not in a boasting way, it was more about something else and this passed trough the conversation. It made me feel respected. Even though he was already pretty in love with me he still refused to show even the tiniest hint, because that would be wrong and against his moral code.

Edit: You guys make me feel like my standards are low, and it secretly makes me happy. My last relationship ended because he said my standards were too high, and I felt like they weren't. It made me a bit insecure I guess. Thank you for helping me. You made me realise my standards are fine and I appreciate it.","Sounds like a good guy üôå

Hope it goes well for you guys"
dating,orwbos,2021-07-26 10:53:51,"Dating doesn't suck, finding someone to date does","I actually enjoy meeting new people and going on dates. I rarely have a bad experience and I am secure enough about myself to not fall for bullshit anyway. I feel that basically every time I went on a date it was a worthwhile experience.

 However it is the process of finding someone who wants to go on a date that is so gruelling. Especially on OLD: Thousands of profiles to swipe, dozens of people who just don't reply, ghost after 2 sentences or just can't hold a conversation consisting of more than 1 word replies. Then half of people either flake or stand you up. It is so weird because I always feel that the first date should be the START of getting to know someone, not the result of painstakingly having to weed through thousands of people not interested in talking to you.","As one adage goes:

""The only thing worse than having to go to work on Monday morning is having to (look for work) on Monday morning.""

Winning is also much more fun than training or preparing for an event.

"" I always feel that the first date should be the START of getting to know someone, not the result of painstakingly having to weed through thousands of people not interested in talking to you.""

To use the job search analogy once more: Your online dating profile is a ""Want Ad"" and everyone's profile who reaches out  to you is a ""resume"". It's also vice versa when *you* initiate.

Not everyone who sends in  a resume to the company gets a call from the HR rep.

Not everyone who gets a call from HR is forwarded to the hiring manager.

Not everyone who speaks to the hiring manager is invited to have a face to face interview.

And not everyone who has a face to face interview is invited back or hired.

*Very few people wait until the 'first date"" to {start} their screening process.*

There are basically two forms of rejection: Direct and Indirect.

Direct rejection occurs whenever someone reaches out to another and is told ""no"" or ignored.

Men for the most part have to contend with more ""direct rejection"" because they usually initiate.

Indirect rejection requires no contact. For example when a man chooses *not to approach* a woman for whatever reason he has indirectly rejected her.

Indirect rejection can hurt just as much as direct rejection if a person has a crush on someone who ignores them or if no one ever initiates contact with them. They never get *chosen* to play.

When it comes to dating the people who have learned to enjoy the process tend to enjoy it better than those who can't wait to get it over with and be in a committed relationship.

""I actually enjoy meeting new people and going on dates.""

It will probably be easier for you to simply focus on making having *fun* your goal. Take the pressure off of yourself to have a date for a while. Simply decide to expand your social circle by having an genuine interest in getting to know some new people.

Also OLD isn't the only way to meet new people. You an sign up for a few hobby/interest groups on your local Meetup site, LinkedIn also has singles networking groups and you can get to know people while attending the various group meetings.

Saying ""yes"" more often to invitations to attend gatherings after work, parties, weddings, and various other social functions will increase your odds of meeting more available singles.

Befriend someone who is actually doing well in the dating scene to hangout with and observe.

Occasionally hit the nightclub/dance club or happy hour bar scene with a friend can be fun.

Consider joining a couple of (niche) online dating sites which are geared towards specific must have traits people are looking for be it religion, race, nationality, weight, height, personality type, or whatever. Simply Google ""Online dating sites for..."" and odds are there is a site for it.

You also want to read independent reviews about OLD sites and apps before selecting one. You can learn the male to female ratio, average educational/income level, racial makeup, sexual orientation, average age, and total number of members on the site.

Whatever it is *you want* should dictate where *you* shop!

If you're really adventurous you can visit the SinglesCruise website and book a Caribbean cruise on a ship that's (only for singles). The worst case scenario you have a tropical vacation.

Some people are more outgoing while on vacation or the further they are away from home.

When you make *having fun* the goal it's easier to relax and be more personable.

If two people cross paths that are compatible and enjoy being around each other things will naturally evolve on their own. Make a decision to *enjoy the journey* no matter what happens.

dating,q50wud,2021-10-10 04:16:08,Please stop encouraging children,"Felt a strong need to make this post based on a post I just came across and one of comment suggestions. The post was a 14yo girl seeking advice on how to get a partner. Someone commented suggesting going on online groups‚Ä¶. Please STOP ENCOURAGING CHILDREN to explore their dating life online, we shouldn‚Äôt even encourage them making friends online. THEY DONT KNOW THESE PEOPLE. That is so unsafe! It takes very little information for a predator to locate a child. And young teens can be very easily manipulated into thinking situations are safe if they ‚Äúmeet in public‚Äù or ‚Äúvideo chatted‚Äù or ‚Äútalked on the phone and sent photos back and forth‚Äù. Our youth are being exploited, raped, trafficked, kidnapped every day already without online playing a factor, and are at a higher risk when they‚Äôre interacting with literal strangers! There is a false sense of security. As a woman who was very fortunate to have escaped a similar situation as a young teen I seriously seriously urge that we instead teach children to form real life bonds with people, even if it‚Äôs just friendship and not focusing on relationships until later on, and how to be safe with their online activity. Why would you ever encourage a child to partake in risky online activity???",Posts by children should be automatically banned. I shudder at the thought of the DMs they get after they post.
dating,mvrm90,2021-04-21 22:53:34,It really sucks that it‚Äôs precisely the times you NEED someone the most that you really shouldn‚Äôt be with anyone and odds are low you‚Äôll attract anyone,I‚Äôm about to get out of a slump and I‚Äôm just like why should I get in a relationship with someone *now* exactly? Lol. I think the sad truth is that a kind of neediness is the primary thing that makes people want a companion in the first place,"Yes, a kind or multiple kinds of loneliness cause people to want relationships. Touch loneliness, skin hunger, sexual starvation, cuddle quotas, companionship, kissing, etc. Those are all needs for many (not all) people. And it's genuinely okay to need things. I'm not sure why our society has demonized need... they should probably wake up and realize that we're all just a bundle of needs. We need food, oxygen, water, sleep, companionship, support, personal expression, fulfillment in a variety of areas of life. Etc. We came into the world with a ton of needs and we will live every day of our life having needs. Some we can fulfill on our own, a bunch we cannot. Don't be ashamed of needs, we're social creatures and we each have a hierarchy of needs that is unique to us. Whatever you feel you need, don't let anyone shame you for it. (As long as it's legal and stuff, lol.) A relationship or things that typically go with it, can very much be a valid and reasonable need. And some people don't like the idea of satisfying those needs through countless, risky and meaningless one night stands or hook ups. So if you're a hopeless romantic person, as your name says and you prefer to meet those basic human needs from inside a relationship, don't let anyone imply it's wrong. Everyone acts like ""need"" and ""dependancy"" is the devil... when in reality, it's not like any of us can make out or cuddle with ourselves. So really, it's just society gaslighting us into believing we ""should"" be happy and fullfilled alone. And it's nonsense."

dating,klq3a3,2020-12-28 12:59:05,Don‚Äôt give away your heart too easily.,"I don‚Äôt know if this is the right place to post this, but I‚Äôm very recently heartbroken and I feel like I‚Äôm finally realizing this. 

Never give your heart to someone so easily. More often then not, they‚Äôre not going to be that permanent person in your life. Take your time when it comes to love, so you can be sure that the person you‚Äôre with is truly worthy of everything that you‚Äôre worth and all the love and care that you have to give. It‚Äôs easy to have fun in the beginning but the true test is to see if the person will stay once things start getting real.

I‚Äôm someone who loves easily, and loves hard. Especially when someone seems to feel the same towards me and gives me the same energy that I‚Äôm giving them. But twice now I‚Äôve been knocked down, forced to pick up the pieces of a broken heart, because the person who I thought was going to be my forever ended up being a completely different person than what I originally thought they were.

I‚Äôm not sure how I‚Äôll manage this the next time I think I meet someone wonderful. But I‚Äôll figure it out. I don‚Äôt really suspect I‚Äôll even bother looking again for a good while. But when the time comes, I‚Äôll learn to be more cautious with my heart. I don‚Äôt think it can really take anymore pain.

I‚Äôve been through breakups before, but these last two, especially my most recent has really hurt me in ways I‚Äôve never felt with others. I can‚Äôt go through that again.","That's admirable - taking responsibility for your own pain, in that it wasn't the other person who solely broke your heart, but yourself for giving too much too soon etc. Not enough people do that, in my opinion, since blame (or a more fitting word) is easier to assign to another than it is to ourselves. While giving your heart away too easily sounds romantic, I think 'reciprocity' should be used in replacement of heart. Give, but pull back when it's clear you're not getting the same level of interest or care back. Don't keep giving expecting that they'll eventually love you or care for you in the same way or that you can change them. And when in a relationship, the push and pull won't always be equal (some days you'll give more, others they will due to the natural highs and lows of relationships and outside factors) but the dynamics should always be equal."

dating,pp3lb7,2021-09-16 01:30:03,People suck.. Date ended before it began due to music taste.....,"Little venting sess here. So a couple weeks ago i met/matched with someone on a dating app (not Tinder) and we hit it off, she's 21 and I'm 26 so it ain't THAT bad of an age difference. Anyway we started talking and texting and everything was going good, so about a week and a half into it i asked her out on a date because we both let the other one know we were looking for a serious relationship, i got a yes right away and so I planned a date. The date i had planned was a late lunch date and a trip to a little ""traveling"" fair that usually comes during the summer days with rides and games and what not. (Side note here) I'm a guy that loves ALL kinds of music.. all of it, so that being said, I'm omw to pick her up and listening to my ""Random"" playlist with ALL sorts of music on it, so when i get to her place, the song that was playing was one by the artist Bad Bunny (Latin artist) and she loved it and started jamming out with me, it was going to be about a 20min drive btw. After this, the song ""Hold On, We're Going Home"" by Drake started playing and she loved this one too ""omg this was my soooong"" she exclaimed. Everything's going good right, the next two songs were also to her liking (another Latin song and then an EDM song). We're singing, having fun, all gravy baby right? Well my friends, shit took a hard left turn when the next song started playing. My playlist threw it waaay back with a little motown when ""You've Really Got a Hold on Me"" by the Miracles started playing and she let out a mocking-ish reaction and goes ""whaaaat the fuuck is thisss"" and starts cracking up, pulls out her phone and started recording a snapchat and saying ""bro what iisss thiiss??"" to post on her story.. meanwhile the whole time I'm just looking at her surprised and smiling in a way like saying ""wow"".. and I just said ""well damn alright"".. After she posted her story she goes ""nuh uh, take me back bro"" which I'm pretty sure she was playing because i didn't even hesitate, busted a quick U and started taking her back and she looked at me right away and had a look on her face like ""wait, are you serious"". I just turned up my music and kept jammin out by myself. I knew i made the right decision because after that motown song ended, Crazy Little Thing Called Love by Queen started playing (a CLASSIC!) and she did the mocking reaction again and at that very moment, everything went out the window completely for me lol..

dating,lod99e,2021-02-20 18:26:41,I went on my first date last night,"So I (19M) was molested as a child and it has affected me in a lot of ways, especially in my trust and confidence. Because of this I never dated, but recently started online dating. I met this girl (18F) on Bumble earlier this week and I went over to her dorm last night. And yeah, the date was ridiculously awkward and I had no idea what I was doing. But I still did it, and I had a good time, and I‚Äôm gonna try to see her again.","First, and most importantly, don‚Äôt be shy about seeking therapy to help process what happened in the past. It‚Äôs never too late, and sooner is better.

With this first date under your belt and more to come, keep in mind:

1) When you‚Äôre on dates, the number one goal is to simply make sure that you both are having fun. I know this sounds too simple, but that‚Äôs really what it comes down to. And, you don‚Äôt have to be doing anything in particular to be having fun. If you‚Äôre fun to be around, she‚Äôll have fun being with you. Try to relax, just be yourself, and don‚Äôt overthink it.

2) Don‚Äôt fall into the mode that many guys do after a few successful dates, and think they‚Äôve found ‚Äúthe one‚Äú. Take your time and don‚Äôt be overbearing to her, which will come across as ‚Äúneedy‚Äù, which is offputting, which destroys attraction. This is not easy. Try hard.

3) Try to keep your interactions with her for the most part in person and you‚Äôll be more successful. In other words, it‚Äôs OK to communicate a bit to keep in touch, but make your goal with say, texting, to be to set up dates/hanging out. Once a relationship is established, more texting is fine, but too much, too soon is ironically counterproductive."

dating,uqud9p,2022-05-16 12:04:34,BF cheated on me because of my sexual past,"I (24F) have been with my boyfriend (26M) for almost a year. Nothing unusually disruptive had ever happened, our relationship is near perfect. That was until a month ago when my friend told him about things I used to do when I was younger. She told him about exactly how many guys I've had sex with and crazy shit I used to do. She thought this was a compliment for whatever reason. He got furious with me, like literally made my life hell for an entire month. He treated me like a subhuman, which I was patient with because I tried to get his view. I tried to mend things and make him see me as someone who has changed. But my attempts went to waste. Last week I found out he's been cheating on me for a while. He got way too upset by my sexual past that he thought his best way to vent was cheating. He's blaming it on me, calling me dishonest, and wants me to ""keep trying"" to make the relationship work while he thinks about my genuineness. This just feels weirdly humiliating. He says that no guy would be okay with my past and it kinda makes sense if this is his reaction. I want to leave so badly but this impulse in me wants to prove that I've really changed.

To be perfectly frank ‚Äî my past isn't even that concerning relative to my friends. I had 45 partners, and I did a number of 3somes in college and shortly after.","Your friend did this completely on purpose. And your bf is completely in the wrong to treat you this way.

dating,ord78c,2021-07-25 15:05:37,Hearing the way my girl friends talk about the guys they‚Äôre seeing leaves me with no idea what the hell I‚Äôm doing wrong.,"I‚Äôm so lost on what I‚Äôm doing that keeps girls away from me. 

I have a decent amount of female friends who are my age and who seem to be normal smart and well adjusted. Whenever I hear them talk about their dating lives it is always just crazy. Like if I was in their shoes I don‚Äôt see how I couldn‚Äôt dump them, or how I could even start dating them to begin with.

Like I have one friend that‚Äôs ‚Äúdating‚Äù this one guy she‚Äôs really into but he only ever talks to her when he wants to fuck her and ignores her the rest of the time. This girl is literally getting played and she‚Äôs still head over heels for them. There‚Äôs a mother girl who has been with her boyfriend for 3 months but can‚Äôt bring him anywhere because he‚Äôs super jealous and has a habit of fighting other guys at every party they go to. Like why the hell would you be with this person.

There‚Äôs other stories like this and they vent and complain about their guys constantly and I‚Äôm just left wondering what I‚Äôm doing that‚Äôs so wrong that the guys they‚Äôre seeing are successful with women and I‚Äôm not. I mean I know people never believe guys when they say this, but I think I have a pretty good personality. If not, it‚Äôs at least better than a guy that just keeps girls around solely for sex when I know they want something more. How are guys that are that shitty of people getting attention from girls and I just can‚Äôt.

This is just so frustrating.","Girls who are putting up with that kind of shit from a partner often aren't the girls you're going to want attention from. You want a woman who is going to see that kind of behavior and go ""fuck that, I'm out."""

And then they go swipe swipe swipe on the merry go round of dating apps.","It is because people view arguments as ""problems"".

One of the strangest delusions that has taken root in the modern world is the idea that you can always be happy. 

People see arguments as failures, and so they do not take responsibility for them, and feel a strong urge to appropriate blame for the argument existing rather than taking responsibility for resolving it. 

You see it beyond intimate relationships. People see a person disagreeing with them as a failure, and feel an urge to prove that the other person is ""at fault"", rather than seeing disagreements as a simple fact of existence and taking responsibility for navigating them correctly. 

A lot of misery in dating and elsewhere is born out of these people who are aiming to experience no problems or, even worse, to experience constant ""positivity"". It is these people, and sometimes it seems like that's most people, who are completely unprepared for anything negative. It is these people who need ""safe spaces""."

I‚Äôve made this mistake a few times in my past few dates. The conversations that leave a twinkle in her eye aren‚Äôt the ones that have you showing off your success. Rather, it‚Äôs the conversations that make her laugh, giggle, blush and showing a legit interest in her.  

I‚Äôve learned that financial security should not be there to woo her, but to assist in building your character so that you yourself are confident and happy.

So, I asked him to clarify because I honestly had no clue what he was talking about. Then he goes, ‚ÄúYou want to know if my family‚Äôs rich.‚Äù (He mentioned he went boating over the weekend) Then he goes on to tell me about his boat and beach house and said if I ‚Äòplayed my cards right‚Äô he might take me on his boat one day.

Personally, I don‚Äôt give two shits about how well off someone is when I‚Äôm first meeting them. As long as they have a roof over their heads and a job that pays them decently, I couldn‚Äôt care less how much money he makes or has (seemed like a trust fund baby). As far as I‚Äôm considered, his money is his and my money is mine. Even if we got married someday, that wouldn‚Äôt change for a long time.

 The rest of the date went terribly too. He ‚Äòaccidentally‚Äô spilled the ice from his drink into my lap and proceeded to grope my legs in an effort to ‚Äòdry me off‚Äô. Needless to say I never dated a ‚Äòrich‚Äô finance guy again."

dating,mjp6db,2021-04-04 04:39:25,Getting tired of being left on read and I came across this article that helped me get over it,"TLDR; your worth doesn‚Äôt change based on someones romantic interest in you

‚ÄúEven though it‚Äôs an artificial means of communication, texting someone you like requires an element of vulnerability. With every text, you‚Äôre putting yourself out there by expressing your continued interest, hoping they‚Äôll reciprocate.

If they don‚Äôt reciprocate, remember not to panic. The natural first reaction is embarrassment, but don‚Äôt beat yourself up for taking a risk and allowing yourself to be vulnerable. Vulnerability is crucial for any future healthy relationship, so don‚Äôt teach yourself to be closed off to avoid pain.

**Know that their lack of a response isn‚Äôt a reflection of your lovability. Your worth doesn‚Äôt change based on someone‚Äôs romantic interest in you.**‚Äù","Ok yes, and this speaks to the larger message of **work on yourself**. 

What this does NOT mean is ‚Äúok, I‚Äôll work on myself and improve myself as a potential partner...how come it still doesn‚Äôt work? I‚Äôm tired of this advice, I‚Äôve done all I can to work on myself ‚Äî I‚Äôm in shape, I earn good money, I have interesting hobbies WHAT GIVES!!‚Äù 

When people advise you to work on yourself, **it‚Äôs so that you can focus on doing and achieving things that make you happy and make you feel complete**. When you‚Äôve achieved that point, your sense of self-worth is driven by you and you only, and no one and nothing ‚Äî not a ‚Äúread‚Äù text ‚Äî can make you feel any lesser. 

And that‚Äôs what makes you whole. And it‚Äôs whole people that attract other whole people."

dating,q1bmn6,2021-10-04 18:29:23,"Men‚Äôs advice. Skipping foreplay, rushing, and not using your fingers are the biggest mistakes you can make during sex","Building sexual tension and anticipation, teasing, and stimulating her without intercourse is crucial, not just for her enjoyment, but for the overall experience of everyone involved during sex.

Sex and intercourse are not one in the same. Intercourse, which involves penetration, should be viewed as only as a part of the entire act of sex, which involves foreplay‚Äîkissing, touching, oral sex, and stimulation with fingers.

Often times, guys will rush right into penetration without the gradual building of sexual tension, without going down on her or using fingers to get her closer to orgasm. They are too influenced by porn, or they let their ego too involved, and believe that jabbing their dick in her pussy in a straight forward motion is the only way to get her off. Some important things to remember‚Äî

Fingering and outside stimulation with the fingers: All female orgasm and physical pleasure during sex is derived from the Clitoris, which is a network of nerves throughout the vagina, not just the ‚Äòhead‚Äô, the piece of flesh near the ‚Äòhood‚Äô of the vagina.

The ‚ÄòG-Spot‚Äô is an overly-mythicized cluster of clitoral nerves that is on the upper ‚Äòroof‚Äô of the inside of the vagina (for example, if she is on her back facing you). Using your index and middle finger you can stimulate this area using a ‚Äòcome here‚Äô motion, while making contact with this area with your fingers. I‚Äôve also found if you use the same fingers, but use an upward, pulsating motion where you press against the area, like a rapid heartbeat, it works as well.

Combining these ‚ÄòG-Spot‚Äô motions while performing oral sex on her while fluttering your tongue on the ‚Äòhead‚Äô of the Clitoris give her multiple sensations at the same time and will drive her nuts.

Also, kissing or sucking on her breasts, and kissing her neck while you rub her in the general area around the head of the Clitoris is incredibly effective with building anticipation. Rub your index and middle fingers in a broad semi-rapid clockwise motion around the area, or use the same fingers in a vertical motion.

Getting her close to orgasm or thoroughly stimulated before intercourse occurs is key. Even if she asks for you to penetrate her, wait a few minutes longer. Tell her you‚Äôre not done yet. This will benefit you in the end. She will be wetter, more passionate and less inhibited when intercourse occurs.

Focusing on pleasing your woman and embracing foreplay is not ‚Äòsimp‚Äô behavior. Guys who say this have no clue about seduction and are posturing to sound dominant. Take your time, and the sex will be better for both of you.","The biggest mistake you can make with sex is being severely lacking in communication both before, during and after the encounter. Talk about what you want what you don't want what you like and dislike. Talk about what feels good during and when you finish talk about the things you liked or didn't like. Continue to do this with your partner. Foreplay is necessary yes. But what good is foreplay if you dont communicate what about specific things turn you on since everyone is different.

Doing this regularly will lead to mind blowing results if you can adequately communicate and follow through with wants and desires. This is one of the reasons why I believe having the same partner for multiple encounters is so beneficial. You're able to learn what someone likes and vice versa."
dating,hbgex7,2020-06-18 15:09:55,"On dating apps, ask the women (or men) out as soon as you can, a few days texting is more than enough","So I read it a lot here, that people don't know how to keep a meaningful conversation, how to get to know someone via texting, how to keep someone's attention, etc.

As a woman, what I liked the most when I was using dating apps if we met up immediately. I don't know either the answers for the above questions, I'm not a good texter. But if someone asked me out for a drink or a coffee, I went for it. If it was a 1 hour of coffee date, but it didn't work out, we didn't match in real life, it was one hour of our life. But if it was a good date, that it could last from 5 pm to 3 am, we were happy and we kept dating. But I can not imagine texting with someone for weeks/months before meeting in real life, only to turn out you don't actually like each other in person. I had a guy texting me everyday for like a month, but he never asked me out. I tried to text him as much as I could, but I'm not good in opening up to someone who I didn't even met. And one day, he ghosted me. Seriously, what was it good for? We put one month of effort in it for nothing. Just ask me out, and see if we like each other in person.

And this advice is not just for men, with half of my dates I suggested going out after a few texts.",[deleted]
dating,ooq543,2021-07-21 13:42:33,This guy who wanted to date me spent a full hour talking about how much he hated the homeless,"I met this guy at a small event who had a recording studio, and he offered to let me use it to record voiceovers for a podcast I am working on for my company. I recorded for an hour, and then I think he wanted to date or kiss me, because he kept trying to get me to have a drink (alcohol or coffee or water), and gave me a tour of his house. There wasn‚Äôt really an option to stop talking to him, as every time a natural ‚Äúexit‚Äù appeared, he would maneuver me to a new conversation.

It was a very nice house, and I think he wanted to date me because he kept telling me how much money he made as a lawyer, the property he owned, etc. I was not very comfortable or engaged with him, but he laughed at everything I said that was even moderately funny.

He brought me onto his balcony, where he told me all about how much he hated the homeless population in Seattle, and how much he was working to disband them, and it wasn‚Äôt the government‚Äôs job to find them a place to go. He talked about this for a full hour.

As a teenager, I had a single mom who could barely make rent (deadbeat dad!), and we were almost homeless. When I was 15, she had $292 in her checking account with three kids. She was able to make a bunch of money through hard work and determination, and even bought all of us houses and nice cars as adults, so most people think I‚Äôve come from money. But I did not, and I recognize how purely lucky I am that my mom made it out, and that I could have easily been homeless.

I left as soon as it started getting dark outside. I thought maybe he had had a bad time because I didn‚Äôt engage with him, but when I messaged him to say thank you, he tried to set up a date and also followed me on all social medias. 

If you want to have sex with a girl, maybe don‚Äôt tell her how much you hate the homeless? Even if there are problems in the city, don‚Äôt you know that makes you look like a heartless villain?","

dating,jg6385,2020-10-22 19:02:08,Sometimes it just doesn‚Äôt work out.,"I met this girl on Hinge and we hit it off over text. Good conversation, lots of questions in both directions. Wound up going for drinks and something hit different; this girl was cool, ambitious, driven, engaged in our conversation and more. We went on about 5-6 more dates over the past few weeks, talked pretty frequently (not **constantly** but often enough that it seemed like we were both interested). Always had lots of fun when we went out and hung out at both her and my place.

This past weekend, I popped the ‚ÄúWhat are you looking for from this‚Äù question. She answered with what seemed like exactly what I wanted: Not looking for something casual, she likes me, but she‚Äôs busy and needs someone who can accept that. I‚Äôm very busy in my own life and have been with non-busy people before; it seems 100% easier to be with someone who‚Äôs also busy because they get that you‚Äôre someone independent along with them. The conversation ended with kisses and agreement that we were ‚Äúexclusive‚Äù but not boyfriend/girlfriend.

She texted me today and let me know (in a very long message) that she had a change of heart and just isn‚Äôt ready for it.

This sucks and I‚Äôll probably be a little more heartbroken about it later today once I‚Äôve had time to process. We‚Äôve been seeing each other for about a month now and while that seems short, I had talked myself into thinking this one was going the distance. She seemed very into it and engaged in the relationship.

Some stuff that‚Äôs giving me solace, for anyone who might need some affirmation:

* I made a list of personal qualities/strengths that I have taped up in my room. I look at it  every morning when I wake up as a reminder that I‚Äôm ambitious, driven, independent, athletic, and so on. Someone breaking up with you doesn‚Äôt change or take away any of that.
* Sometimes the timing just doesn‚Äôt work out. This girl is significantly busier than I am right now and sometimes that just throws people off.
* Being with someone who \*is\* so awesome as this chick was is a great learning experience because it helps to teach you what you‚Äôre looking for in someone (almost more so than dating someone who has qualities you don‚Äôt like). Now I have more in my ‚Äúwhat to look for‚Äù arsenal on future dates.
* There was a post here a while ago along the lines of ‚ÄúI wonder where **the one** is and what they‚Äôre doing right now, even though we haven‚Äôt met yet‚Äù. For what it‚Äôs worth that has been very helpful to think of today. Someone‚Äôs out there who appreciates the qualities and strengths that I bring to the table. Maybe they‚Äôre with someone and they aren‚Äôt happy. Maybe they‚Äôre working on themselves and aren‚Äôt on a dating app. Maybe I‚Äôve passed them in the grocery store and didn‚Äôt even know it.

Dating sucks sometimes. But I know one day I‚Äôll go on the last first date of my life, and I‚Äôll have learned a lot along the way.",I totally relate to where you said you talked yourself into thinking this one was going to go the distance. That is the part that always kills me. Getting myself hyped up. At this point it almost feels like a bad omen
dating,l0b5h7,2021-01-19 03:29:59,He didn't want commitment so I dropped him,"I'm making this post because I finally dropped the guy I've been talking to for 6 months.

Backstory: I (F21) met this guy (M25) on tinder back in July and we went on a couple dates in person, and then we became ""long distance"" for 4 months because of school. We constantly texted every single day. When I got back from school we went on more dates and I slept with him a few times. Everything was great, however I began to wonder what we were and if he was going to ask me to be his gf. We never spoke about our intentions when we first started talking (I never thought we'd talk for this long) so I decided I needed to bring up the ""talk"" after the new year since at this point we had been talking for 5 months. When we had the talk I found out he didn't want a relationship because he's not really about commitment and to my surprise he's never been in a relationship before. I told him I wanted to get into a relationship but then I decided I was fine with being fwb. Everything was okay, but after two weeks of being fwb I realized it wasn't making me happy anymore. I kept wondering if he was fucking other girls or if he was talking to anyone else, which made me realize being fwb was only draining my happiness, and the sex wasn't even good enough to stay fwb.

Slowly I began trying to distance myself and I finally decided to drop him after our latest hangout. During our hangout it clicked that although he became a friend, in the end he just wanted me for sex. I realized it was best for me to get myself out of this situation for the sake of my own happiness. I texted him that I wanted to end what we had going on, and he said It was fine and I should do what is best for me.

I wish I didn't feel sad right now. It's unfortunate I'll no longer talk to him every day. He's a great guy, but he couldn't offer the commitment I wanted. I  wonder if he cares at all, if he's sad, or if he's going to miss me and regret not wanting to commit, etc. However I try to remember that he didn't like me enough to commit, so its best to stop wasting my time and energy on him.

I'm proud of myself for finally being able to let go.

dating,rfi6y2,2021-12-13 15:26:54,"I hate the new dating terminology of ""talking"" and ""talking stage""","I'm not even on the older side, I'm under 30, but I wasn't in the dating game for most of my 20s because I was in a relationship. Now that I'm out here navigating dating as an adult it seems like the terminology and stages I'm used to have completely shifted. 

I spent months thinking ""talking"" and ""the talking stage"" meant those few days or sometimes a week or two of chatting via text before the first meet so I was SO confused why people on social media were so upset about things ending during that stage. I just figured out people refer to dating as ""talking"" now. Like when they say talking stage they mean someone they are going on dates with but they just haven't had the exclusivity/relationship discussion yet. 

I hate this because I feel like calling dating ""talking"" is underplaying how serious and emotional dating can be. It definitely seems like some fuckboy came up with this terminology so that when he ghosted a girl he was dating he would underplay how serious it actually was by saying,  ""No we were just *talking*.""

In my opinion, even if you aren't exclusive with someone (or in some kind of defined relationship you've discussed), but are going on dates, being intimate in anyway, and talking regularly you are DATING that person.","I'm Reddit old and not afraid to say I hate it too. ""Talking"" seems like they're describing a couple of people who are in negotiations to start dating."
dating,k2lyjr,2020-11-28 11:10:59,"Don't waste your time hoping in a situationship, it will lead most likely to heart break.","hey all,

Currently I've just ended a ""situationship"" with a girl that I genuinely started to like. I am a successful young man, she is quite popular in the fitness industry and she seemed very natural, normal and kind when we first met which was quite unusual for an ""influencer"".  
Long story short, we met in the gym 27/11/2019 and things started off quite rapidly.  
We were starting to have parties together, me sleeping at her place but no feelings and we just did that when we were drunk.

We did that for about 4 months and I ended things in March because she said that she didn't want anything serious, she didn't see me as dating material. Which I accepted but said that we had to part ways because this won't lead to anything good.

Fast forward, we didn't talk for 5 months during the strict lockdown. I wasn't into her anymore, got myself back into dating and I was feeling more confident than ever. I started to go back to the gym with my friend and she popped right back in front of us. (she doesn't train there).  
At that time I was starting to see another girl but very early stages and I wasn't that much into her. This girl knew about that and was okay with it. I took things very slowly because didn't want to get hurt again, but little by little we started to see each other at least twice a week, sleeping together, etc.. But all around it was a much better dynamic, we didn't drink alcohol, we just enjoyed each other's presence. I wasn't getting needy or clingy, I was fine with her doing her life and me doing me.

Then we decided to go on vacations with some friends for a week. And we literally spent whole the week like a couple, holding hands, kissing, sex, cute things, etc... everything that a couple would do. Then we got back, she got a bit cold, we talked about it, she said she didn't want anything but had feelings and couldn't stop herself from being with me. I went along with that knowing that it'll hurt me in the long run and that was probably my mistake.

Fast forward 7-8 weeks (remember we see sleep at least once or twice together, we talk everyday for hours, we share a lot, we are becoming the n¬∞1 person for each other). I thought that given the intensive interactions we have, her being more proactive (asking me to book my sunday for her, to go on a citytrip, etc...) and way more invested + all of her friends and colleagues telling her that she should date me officially, that we could start something.

I've never been so wrong, she gave me the cold treatment again. Blamed herself because she doesn't understand why she loves me but can't love me enough to date me, that she's never been this happy in her life with me, that she's never experienced that much love given to her and she liked every ounce of it. She can't face the fear of losing me (cried about it). But she can't give me what I'm looking for.  
In the meantime, i've developed feelings too. She wanted to remain friends, and remove our intimate moments, which I refused because I just can't do that, it hurts like hell.

My no-contact started today, hoping that she won't pop again in my life for the 3rd time. My fault of giving this another go and my fault of not stopping it rapidly when she repeated that she didn't want to date me.  
Lesson learned : If a girl says they don't want to date you, but do everything that any girlfriend would do for you, remember that she didn't want to date you, no matter what actions she takes towards you. Don't get attached. Listen to her, don't push it, let her come with actual words or let her invest in you.",Sounds like it‚Äôs definitely her and not you. Maybe you guys are meant to be together when she‚Äôs in a different space mentally and emotionally. Women have to mature sometimes too. I‚Äôm still sorry you had to go through that.

What I have realized is that it was that I couldn't cope with their rejection and not the person themselves. 

It's the rejection of that person not being into me that prevented me from moving on. I used to want the other person to really like me for my own ego (and also I have some people pleasing tendencies) so when someone didn't like me, it really bruised my ego. 

I have learned that I have to stop being dependent on that external validation and honestly focus on my own self esteem (it took a while for me). So now, when someone rejects me, it still stings, but it stings just becauses rejection is a part of life, not because of my ego where I think everyone and their mother should like me. 

TLDR; Your ego may be the reason why you can't move on",yeah and not being able to live out the potential of that specific person and what you thought they in particular would have to offer you
dating,npt0ue,2021-06-01 12:38:17,Girl told me about her FWB on our first date - WHAT?,"Had an amazing first date this weekend. It lasted 5 hours, talked about loads of stuff, had our first kiss, etc. Overall it went great and I'd like to see her again; It was almost all great, BUT... Towards the end, we were sitting down talking and I said:

 ""I'd love to be able to give good back rubs."" to which she said something to the effect of:

""Just got this new nice smelling lotion for massages. I LOVE backrubs, I'm in a friends-with-benefits situation and he gives amazing backrubs""

My stomach sank. It was completely out of left-field and I didn't know how to respond. The conversation sort of shuffled onto something else. I suspect because early in the date we were joking about some serious displays of PDA going on around us, which led briefly to a discussion of kink, she maybe felt the tone was relaxed enough to mention it. Regardless, I'm in a weird situation now.

I only ever sleep with one person at a time, whether that's in a fwb, dating, or a relationship. I only feel comfortable if that's their view too. Now I'm going to have to broach this subject if we continue seeing each other. My mind jumped to thinking she's going to ask me to become her second fwb but I'm just guessing, plus that'd be beyond my boundaries. I'd like to see her again but now there's this hurdle. What would you guys do?

tl;dr - I went on an otherwise amazing first date with someone who at the end used the opportunity of me mentioning I wanted to be better at giving backrubs to reveal up her FWB and how's amazing at giving her those.

Edit: I know I'm not replying to every comment, but I am reading every single one of them. I really appreciate all the different viewpoints and advice.","Well it all depends if you‚Äôre okay with it or not. 

It‚Äôs good that she was open and up front early on about her FWB. If you are happy being in an open relationship then go ahead.

dating,fnj0hp,2020-03-23 12:18:57,Just go for it,"Hi guys. I moved too a new village around 6 months ago, around the same time I split up with my ex girlfriend. I have been on a few tinder dates and the girls really were lovely but there was just one thing... In the local supermarket works an absolute gorgeous girl who I've had my eye on ever since I first seen her. She is 100% waaaaay out of my league. The conversations at the checkout we have is amazing and everything just flows naturally compared too anyone else I had been on dates with. Therefore it didn't make me having enough interest into trying too find a partner out of the other girls. All I wanted was this checkout girl! 

I didn't know anything about her personal life (if she had a boyfriend)ect...  so I was pretty nervous about what I did next. Chancing my arm I wrote my name and number on a piece of paper and then proceeded too enter the supermarket not even knowing if she'd be working or not. I grabbed my food and sure enough there she was. I could feel my face going red and the nervs proper kicked in. I was thinking too myself ""do I go ahead with this or not"" but hell what have I got too loose? She finishes serving her customer. Turns too me with her usual gorgeous smile and we go about our conversations like we do most days. At this point just as I am about too pay another customer comes along starts unloading his shopping. This makes me even more nervous knowing that this dude is gonna see what I am about too do.

I said ""*her name* I really enjoy coming into the shop and seeing you. I feel like you are such a lovely genuinely nice person. You are absolutely gorgeous and I would love it if you would like too have a drink with me sometime?"" I could tell by the smile on her face that I had made her day. She was so delighted and accepted my offer *RELIEF* 
I handed her my piece of paper and started walking out the shop. As I turned round she was still grinning from ear too ear and the guy who was stood behind me gave me the nod of approval. Felt like the fucking boss!!

She texted me lastnight and after a few hours speaking we now have a date arranged for Friday. RESULT! 

Just go for it guys. The worst that can happen is being told no. Happy dating and good luck everybody :)","Oh my God- THIS!!! Men like you will surely keep humanity alive. I‚Äôm a woman, I‚Äôm told I‚Äôm ‚Äúhot‚Äù, ‚Äúbeautiful‚Äù, etc. but men are too glued to their phones to ask women out these days. Yes, I could ask guys out, but besides the common indoctrination I‚Äôve undergone that tells me if I ask a man out they‚Äôll likely take advantage and then dump me, frankly I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôm bothering people if I dare talk to them in public because everyone wants to hide behind a screen.

Jesus christ those messages I read are hauntingly cringe, Stealing the same shit lines from r/tinder that she's heard a million times by then isn't going work, remember you're talking to a stranger trying to get to know them, you wouldnt dive head first in with some innuendo about her pussy or sex if you were talking to her irl so don't do it online, it shouldn't feel like a job interview either where your asking the most basic dry questions imaginable either, you need to find a line between funny and respectful a d not boring.

It was so cute the way she said that, it didnt seem so flirty as she was much older than me. I been having some hard days dealing with depression, that single compliment was so heartwarming and it made my day 
So girls, please compliment more, as this is kinda rare and it might help someone go through an other day

Edit: 
Calm down folks, im not sayin women MUST compliment men
I understand your bad experiences with men misinterepretting a compliment, and its totally okey if u dont, no one is going judge u, u r not responsible to nurture anyone (except ur man ofc)
Im just saying it was special for me, and i would like to hear things like that more often, and u girls may make someone's day with just a simple compliment 
Btw i only laughed got a little shy and said thx (didnt bother the woman dont worry hhh),","Yeah I‚Äôve read about how some guys dont get complimented a lot and it broke my heart, so i compliment my bf at least twice a day.

I always notice how good his clothes look on him or how good he is at drawing and how cute he is when he just woke up etc but now i try to remember to say those out loud.

At first when we started dating he was really akward when i complimented him (which was odd because he is never akward, it must have been because he wasnt used to compliments), but now he says ‚Äùthanks‚Äù or smiles."

dating,hlf0nf,2020-07-05 02:11:20,"Would people be interested in a blind dating app where you match based on real time voice conversations, rather than just pictures?","Hi all! I've been spending this quarantine working on a dating app that flips the script on traditional dating apps‚Äìinstead of filtering first on pictures, the app I've made matches based on real time voice conversations that you have with your dates. After you match, you can continue the conversation and once you feel more comfortable with your partner, you can reveal your profiles. Some of my family and friends have described it as the Netflix show ""Love is Blind"" in app form.

The app is actually out and ready, but I don't want to drop the name of the app here without the moderator's approval. If you're interested, DM me and I can send you a link (or if you're a mod, I would really appreciate approval). I feel like a lot of posts that I've read here are related to traditional dating app fatigue and this is definitely a very different app! It really does feel more fun to use than just swiping. Would love to know your thoughts and hope you're having a wonderful weekend!","I would be crushed if I hit it off with a guy and he stopped talking to me after he saw my pictures. How do you nicely tell someone ‚ÄúI like your personality but I don‚Äôt find you attractive.‚Äù There‚Äôs no good way to say that and spare someone‚Äôs feelings.

Would much prefer someone to swipe left on me if they didn‚Äôt find me attractive (I would never know about that) than for me to think things were going well only for them to dip when they see my pics."
dating,swimrd,2022-02-19 20:04:59,"Dating isnt ""EASY"" for women","Just because a women gets tons of matches on a dating app doesnt mean its easy for her.

If you were responsible for something everyone wants from you, you would also be selective.

The common misconception guys have is that they think a girl wants only a guy with 6 pack abs and 6ft
Maybe some want that, and she can get it, but women are looking for a good person for them whos nice to be around.

Imagine u had a ton of money, and all these women are manipulating you in your dms tryna get into your pockets.

Obviously all those girls will want you but once they got in ur pockets and u get no sex out of it, ull start being selective.

You have to realize that dating isnt easy for women, and you dont have to shutdown every women here who talks ab their dating experience

Women have high standards but they make considerations because theres something they are looking for outside the chiseled jawline

Edit: it may be a lot of choices, but one bad choice equates to a consequence.

Edit 2: im a guy",Honestly anything stable at this point would be nice. I really want to date to have something meaningful in life but like every other guy I meet either has had his heart broken so he can never fall in love or is emotionally unavailable. I get a ton of matches but none of them want anything meaningful. So I just gave up on dating apps altogether.

dating,reb194,2021-12-11 22:59:09,My Date Rejected Me Because I Don't Have Friends,"I (F34) had a first date the other night with a guy (M32). The fact that I don't have a friend group at all came up about 15 minutes into the date and he completely focused on that fact the entire rest of the date, which only lasted about an hour and a half. He brought up the subject of friends and I just kind of awkwardly tried to avoid saying straight out I don't really have friends, but he noticed and said, ""Wait, do you not have ANY friends?!?!!"" (Technically I do still have one friend from high school, but I just choose not to talk to her most of the time and it's how our relationship has always been).

&#x200B;

He was clearly so turned off by me not having friends. He kept asking me questions about it and said he was just fascinated because he'd never known anyone like me that was so closed off from people before (fascinated in a very bad way, because his entire tone was like What the f\*ck is wrong with you??). He suggested I try Bumble BFF and go to therapy.

&#x200B;

He pretty much tried to psychoanalyze me the entire time (when he wasn't too busy laughing at me), trying to figure out what happened to make me like this. There's nothing interesting really, I've been a loner my entire life by choice. It's just how my personality is. I had lots of friends growing up and all through high school had a big friend group, but still chose to be alone a lot of times. I don't have a problem being alone most of the time. I'm not looking/desperate for friends at the moment (he seemed to think I should be). I'm only interested in a partner for right now that I can be intimate with.

&#x200B;

I've always been nervous about revealing to dates just how extremely anti-social I actually am. The weirdness of me not having friends has come up as a problem before, but not in a very long time. I am very nervous about trying to date again after this disaster. I've at least learned I should probably avoid going out with very social people who would not understand me, but I can't always tell that about them from just their profile. I don't really know what to look for anymore. On my OLD profiles I even put that I'm a bit ""weird"" and I'm looking for a fellow weirdo who could understand me (I don't know how else to put it); it's not my fault that guys tend to choose to just ignore this warning and not believe me because I look ""normal"". So, yeah, I don't have much luck with dating.","It is reasonable for it to be a dealbreaker for someone if a potential partner has no friends.

It isn't reasonable however to berate a potential partner for having no friends...

He sounds awful and tbh you probably dodged a bullet."
dating,mxk3eu,2021-04-24 13:34:51,I'm giving up...,"...and I feel great about it.

No longer am I going to let finding a girlfriend be my life's purpose. I'm going to learn to become happy as a single man. It's dangerous to let happiness depend on being in a relationship, because relationships will come and go. It's far better to achieve happiness within oneself - that has much greater staying power.

I'm going to find out what makes me happy, and do a lot of it. More exercise, more hanging with friends, more trying new things. Swiping on dating apps and struggling to get a girlfriend doesn't make me happy, so I'm going to stop doing it. No swiping, no dating and no girlfriend means more time to do whatever the fuck I want.

I'll still have sexual urges. Maybe rubbing one out once in a while is enough. Maybe I'll find a FWB. Maybe I'll pay for sex. Maybe I'll just live with those fucking urges. Who the fuck cares, in any case they won't define me. And if trying to find a FWB, or paying for sex or whatever is giving me grief, then I'll stop doing it. I've gone over a year without sex and, to be honest, it really isn't that bad.

Maybe when I've become happy on my own terms the girls will flock to me. Maybe they won't - fuck it, who cares either way. Maybe I'll die alone, it won't matter because I will have **learnt to be content with myself**. Not only content, but fucking happy and awesome. I'll tell people I'm single and they're going to be fucking impressed with how comfortable I am in saying that. In fact, they'll be jealous that I have all the freedom in the world to live my awesome life.

Maybe this plan will fail, who cares. If it does, it does. For now I'm excited to see what this new approach will do for me.",[deleted]
dating,porieu,2021-09-15 14:43:58,Going down,My man thinks I‚Äôm ok with him not going down on me when I do it for him all of the time . I asked him why and he just says because he doesn‚Äôt like to so I told him yesterday that I wasn‚Äôt doing it anymore either because it‚Äôs just not right . Do you guys think I made the right decision,"If you want a man to eat the box, you gotta get a box eater."
dating,d8k219,2019-09-24 08:03:32,My dating story.,"So I started dating again at the beginning of the year and here is how it went. Guy #1 dated me for 5 months and then told me he‚Äôd been seeing someone else the whole time. Guy #2 dated me for a few months, slept with me, then ghosted me. This was the first time I‚Äôd started dating since my only long-term relationship a couple of years earlier; a guy whom I was with for 5 years that cheated on me multiple times (I‚Äôm aware that I sound very negative and bitter by this point, but please bare with).

So back to the present day. I met this new guy about a month ago, guy #3. We went on a few dates and everything was going seemingly well. I went in with no expectations, and was pleasantly surprised to find that I really liked him. The only thing was, he was incredibly strange. He texted me after our first date to say how much he enjoyed it and that he‚Äôd love to see me again. He puts in equal effort to arrange dates that we‚Äôll both enjoy. He texts me every day to find out about my day. He always replies to my messages. He never avoids the hard questions and he‚Äôs very open with me. He takes a lot of interest in finding out more about me, the way I think, the things I love, the things I don‚Äôt love. He really makes an effort and appreciates the effort I make. It‚Äôs all just very, very strange. Right?

WRONG. HOLY FUCKING SHIT. I have wasted so much time waiting around for assholes that I didn‚Äôt know what it should actually be like when you are dating someone. I got so used to being ignored, being left on read, going out of my way to make an effort, only to get none in return, feeling annoying rather than wanted, getting dishonest communication or none at all, being made to feel like I wasn‚Äôt good enough and that I had to earn the time of others. I was so used to it that I had myself convinced that this was normal. That by speaking up and saying how it upset me, I was being crazy and expecting too much. All of those monumental red flags had become normal to me and instead were not flags at all.

But this...THIS is what it should be like. When someone is genuine and they really do care about you, they don‚Äôt do all those things. You won‚Äôt have to wonder. You won‚Äôt have to feel like you‚Äôre not enough for them, that you have to convince them to be with you. I know this may all be nothing short of a platitude but seriously....I feel like after meeting this guy, I have just woken the fuck up.

Moral of the story? Don‚Äôt let the assholes fool you into thinking that asshole-ness is normal. It isn‚Äôt. It really fucking isn‚Äôt.",Nice realisation! Best of luck:)

I think about dates, first kisses, what the sex will be like, meeting each other‚Äôs friends, etc. I just go down a rabbit hole of wander. This is always of course unbeknownst to the other party and I always keep my cool as much as I can around them but that doesn‚Äôt go to say that I don‚Äôt still have these thoughts or talk to my best friend about it.

9 times out of 10 things never pan out with the guy like I anticipated and I always get my hopes up. Even after going through this cycle many times, it seems to always happen, even knowing it very likely may happen again, and I still don‚Äôt know how to not get giddy when it seems like a guy is really into me and I start wondering if I finally found the one.

It‚Äôs just so disappointing and discouraging to feel so certain that it‚Äôs going to work out with someone only for it to go south.

To those of you who have experienced this, how do you prevent this from happening and keep your cool?","I would love to say experience taught me otherwise and I will not make the same mistake/mistakes in attaching too quickly. For me it comes out of complete lack of intimacy not just sex, but close affection, give me a finger and I'll want more, because im starved.

Went on a date with someone I met on Hinge at the beginning of December and it was probably the best date I've ever had. We had donuts, went bowling, and topped it all off with soul food. At the end I asked to walk her home and she agreed. During the walk we were asking each other arbitrary questions the whole way up until we got to her place where before we parted I asked ""So... last question of the night.."". She then said ""Uh-oh"" and I started to panic a little bit and said ""Oh man, by your answer that tells me I maybe shouldn't ask it!"" and she said ""No, it's because I already know the question!"". I was a little taken a back but simple responded ""Oh? Well... what's the answer then?"" and she then grabbed my coat and kissed me. The air was cold and still, and when we were done her ears were red. It was perhaps the most romantic thing I've experienced in a long time.

tldr: Had a great date that ended in a great kiss. 2020 is lookin' up!

Edit: I'm really surprised by the response of this post; and grateful how positive most of it has been. Thank you all. You're too kind.

His respinse was ""but i keep myself healthy"" and then began to text how tired  he was, then fell asleep and then kept repeating if i really, really wanted him to do an at-home rapid test (here in Germany theyre every in supermarkets).

He has since sent me weird memes about having to rethink my life and ""one must reckon with things in life"". This feels like someone refusing to do sn STI check and insisting they are ""clean"" without even knowing and risking infection.

Did i over-react or am i being unreasonable?

He said yes! We got coffee, went to the laundry mat, and just talked for 2+ hours in my car. It was the most fun and genuine date that I've ever had.

After recently dating a guy for seven weeks I‚Äôve been ghosted. I find it such a cowardly way out. I mean first of all where‚Äôs the decency to just not hurt someone or given them the courtesy of acknowledging breaking it off. We‚Äôre not declaring marriage plans but come on it‚Äôs just the nice thing to do. Secondly,  when you‚Äôve started meeting friends, planned a camping trip and been moving along nicely to then just bail on plans within two days of making them and ignore a follow up hey do you still wanna keep this going. Weirdest of all you‚Äôre too cowardly to break it off and be decent but you wanna still like all my Instagram pics and watch all my stories. Come on guys and girls, be decent.

Whew, vent over.","I just openly told a guy who I‚Äôve been talking to for about two months, via video and text, that I decided I didn‚Äôt want to see him for two reasons I deemed to be red flag-ish on his part.

dating,t0kqia,2022-02-24 20:36:38,Straight men: want to know how women feel being made to feel unsafe and overly-sexualized by men? Imagine if a man did it to you.,"A man who was much larger than you. At least a few inches taller and 50lbs heavier. Maybe he follows you around, stares at you, or tells you dirty things. Maybe he asks you out over and over again or suggests that you only got your job because you gave your boss a blowjob. How comfortable would you feel?

You can't compare it to as if women were doing the same thing to you because you're imagining a scenario where you'd like that attention. Women don't like it, so imagine a big, hairy, sweaty, older man who is much larger and could easily hurt you at will doing it to you. Imagine how you'd feel then. That's how women are made to feel.

So when you're dating, please be empathetic and kind and understanding as to why some women have such strong boundaries.

Little things like not giving you her phone number or wanting to wait a few extra dates to go over to your place may not seem like much to you, but it could be to her. Try to be understanding and put yourself in her shoes and not make her feel pressured to lower her guard earlier than she's comfortable with. I promise you, most women find nothing sexier than a confident, secure man who respects their boundaries.

Edit: I typed this quickly and realize I should have said men or men who date women and not straight men. Apologies!","True story (37M): 

Once I gave a gay acquaintance a ride home from the club. Otw he asked about my preference. I told him I'm straight. He asked if I ever tried being with a guy. He told me I'm handsome and ""very masculine."" This didn't bother me; I find compliments and harmless flirting from men flattering and amusing. 

Then he invited me inside. I'm 5-10, back then weighed about 165 lbs. (I was around 21yo.) He was about 6-2, 250. Somehow we talked about my high school wrestling career. He said he wanted to wrestle me. I declined and he persisted. ""Come on, let's wrestle."" At this point he was standing, staring at me with lust in his eyes.

I came up with an excuse to leave, and he kind of followed me to the door. He offered me A MASSAGE. I think he even hugged me. He seemed dejected that he wasn't going to fuck me.

I don't remember for sure if we hugged because I was in a panicked mental blur. Imagine if he decided he wasn't going to take no for an answer. I felt so small and vulnerable.

Fucking TERRIFYING."
dating,q78ety,2021-10-13 10:40:45,Any other guys deathly afraid of creeping women out?,"24M kissless virgin here. I really don't understand how to approach women when it's so extremely easy to creep them out. I've creeped women out before just by smiling and trying to be friendly with them. You also hear countless women say the don't want to be approached in public, don't approach them at their work place, don't approach them at the gym, don't just join hobby clubs to meet women because that's creepy etc. How can I compliment a woman if shes gonna think I'm just trying to get into her pants? How can I try to flirt when there's a very high chance she will be creeped out?

Nowadays I avoid making eye contact with women because I'd hate to make them feel uncomfortable. I guess dating apps are the only safe way to date but unfortunately I never get any matches. I've been clubbing many times too and have creeped out countless women by dancing near them, they either walk off or their friends come and take them away.

Is the solution to just not care about being a creep? Also, women say desperation is creepy but how do you not be at least slightly desperate when you're 24 and never met a woman who was interested in you? Man, dating is truly the most complicated and difficult thing in the world.","I mean, (woman speaking here) if you‚Äôre creeping out only women and not men then it‚Äôs very likely that your behavior is changing significantly around women. If what you say is true, and you‚Äôre actually not trying to get into women‚Äôs pants, then you should just try to be friends with them the same way you might try to be friends with a guy. Yes, my relationships with my female friends are different than my relationships with my male friends. But upon first meeting them both, I don‚Äôt do anything differently. Then things naturally progress to friendship. And then maybe a relationship. If women are creeped out when you try to flirt with them or when you compliment them it‚Äôs because they can sense that you arent looking at them as another fellow human‚Äîyou‚Äôre looking at them as a potential romantic interest. And MOST times it‚Äôs better to not put that pressure on them to act like they are totally fine with this. Women have an instinct to be guarded around unwanted advances. If they don‚Äôt know you at all, you have to think of it from their perspective and ask yourself if your behavior is really appropriate around them."

Brad and I have a history. While I was growing up, he was very fond of me and I had a secret crush on him. Then after high school he and my brother both moved away to college on different coasts and I didn‚Äôt see Brad for few years. Then last summer he was back in town on business (he works at a west coast tech company now), I was thrilled to see him.

This time, when I saw him I was pleasantly surprised, and but I expected him to just briefly exchange pleasantries and move on. Instead, he stood there talking seemingly to want to catch up. After several minutes, my date said to Brad, may he should pull up a chair and sit. I think he expected that will make Brad to move on. Instead, Brad did exactly as asked and sat down with us knowing I was on a date, and went in telling my date how he had known me all my life and how ‚Äúclose‚Äù we were and so in. Within minutes I began to see that my date sensed that there was much more between Brad and me.

All I want to do is get to know someone and have a good time, if anything comes out of it its a bonus, that's how I view dates.  But I always feel like there is this additional expectation that I am charming/charismatic/ultra confident/witty. And whenever I fail to meet this expectation is when women run

This is coming from times I've met women and heard they were not interested because I was ""a little more shy"" or ""I didn't project my voice enough"" or ""they met someone more charming"". It  doesn't help that I'm bombarded with advice from female friends, from youtube dating coaches and from society about how they just LOVEEEE charming charismatic men. nothing more attractive than a man who has is back arched back, talks in DEEP MANLY VOICE THATS SLOW, throws a witty one liner every now and then.  Any semblance of anxiety - nope - instant ladyboner killer. nervous on a first date? (oh god forbid you are a little nervous when on a first date.) - better NOT SHOW IT otherwise its OVER.

Ok, I Get. we all have to play the part. Women spending all this time on makeup/hair/clothes to look good for dates/to go out.

But as a natural introvert, its completely exhausting.","Ignore all of it and be yourself. I learned the hard way, used to be good at the dating game and doing all mentioned perfectly. However i learned that this type of picky women is not the long term relationship material.

As a female who has worked at a theme park I have had men ask me out daily as I‚Äôm sure a lot of other females can relate to.

It is honestly shameful how some people are being and it‚Äôs a sign that things need to change. When we smile at you we aren‚Äôt flirting, we are at our jobs to earn money. We as customer service workers absolutely have the right to feel safe. The fact the we could risk our jobs by telling a delusional creep to fuck off is absolutely unacceptable.

I‚Äôve friends all over the place and I also crave the kind of friendship you mentioned - just grab a bite, hang out etc. I‚Äôve been trying to use social media (like Instagram) to create friendships with other women that I follow but it‚Äôs like... we‚Äôre all grown. Most of them already have a solid group of friends and arent really looking for more. 

Yeah dating is another hard one but don‚Äôt think I have any advice on that. I just got out of a 2.5 year relationship and I met my ex on tinder lol."

I notice it's mostly said by women because their current partner just happened to waltz into their lives. I think most of us on here can agree that just sitting around doing nothing is bad advice, and only works for women. How many men do you know that have a story, ""And she just walked up to me at the bar and introduced herself and the rest is history!"" I'm not denying that it doesn't happen, it just is so rare that you shouldn't plan for it.

Edit: Didn't realize this would be so popular, was just venting after some stuff with friends and my parents lol
It's not just bad for men, it's also bad for women. Women can be proactive in dating as well.","I feel like the people who say that aren‚Äôt really aware of how community structures have eroded (or were intentionally destroyed) over the past few decades.

There‚Äôs always an element of chance, and I think that‚Äôs kind of a scary thing to a lot of people because we like to think we have more control than we actually do.

But that doesn‚Äôt mean we have no control. I think it‚Äôs more productive to focus on the idea that you should put yourself out there and find community."

We do it at least 2-3 times a week and this is the first time something like this has happened. But anyway, we were having sex, he was close to climaxing, i could tell because he sped up and started moving faster and squeezed me tighter.

And right before he did, no mistaking it, he started grunting ""Mom."" I know for sure that's what he said. He said it at least 2 more times. ""Mom. Mommy."".

Afterwards, he rolled over and went to sleep, but i couldn't get that out of my mind. I asked him what the hell that ""Mommy"" stuff was, but he denied it. He said he didn't say anything at all. I told him i know what i heard but he just ignored me.

I was bored and drunk, replied to him. Convo kept flowing. He asked to meet, i said no cause i wasnt attracted to him. But eventually i said yes which i sort of regretted cause I didnt want to lead him on. I showed up to a coffeeshop nervous and here is a same guy but probably 60 pounds lighter and looks modelish. My jaw dropped. We had great conversations and night flew by. I am having hard time digesting this. Did this happen to anyone? Is this red flag?

Update: hey guys. Thanks for responses. This is not fake and i never post on reddit hence the fresh account and i asked him about it he said he never bothered updating his tinder. He doesnt even have any social media accounts.

It‚Äôs to a point where I feel like whacking their hands away anytime they come near me because all touch feels like a come-on. So, do men actually enjoy non-sexual touch? How can I prevent things from becoming sexual? When it does inevitably become sexual, sometimes I‚Äôm down, sometimes I‚Äôm not. If I‚Äôm not, they get upset and don‚Äôt want to touch me anymore. They give me the silent treatment or say I don‚Äôt even like them. It‚Äôs like sex is a requirement to get any physical affection from men. 

I would love to find a man that wants to cuddle me without expecting any sexual favors in return. I have yet to find one and I‚Äôve dated a fair amount of guys. Are there any men out there that enjoy cuddling just to cuddle? Or is it all just about sex and I‚Äôm fooling myself? I‚Äôve never had a man cuddle me and not try to turn it sexual or at the very least they forcefully push and grind their boners into my butt the whole time. I just want some goddamn intimacy lol. I get that I‚Äôm attractive but I don‚Äôt only want sex. I would like some touch that isn‚Äôt sexual.

I don‚Äôt have causal hookups/fwb fyi. I was dating all these guys.","Men exist on a spectrum, same as girls. In general tho, young men are pretty much non stop boners and fucking if they can pull it off. That's just the testosterone and physical drive they have.

It turns out that he used to live with the guy that my twin sister has been dating for the past two years, so I was glad to know that we share the same circle. I was immediately attracted to him, but I had no idea if he felt the same. When I was in the bathroom, he asked my friend about me. For our last round of drinks, he made sure to slyly write his number on my drink. We have a date planned later tonight, so I‚Äôm excited!

dating,nyjsoi,2021-06-12 23:40:41,"I set my best friend on a blind date and it went horrible... it wasn‚Äôt his fault , but rather hers","I recently set up my best friend up on a date with my co worker. She already went into the date closed minded and kind of pushed her way through. About 90 mins through the date she texted me and said ‚Äúsorry this isn‚Äôt gonna work‚Äù . I later called her and got all the details.

Long story short, he bought her a round of drinks. She was hungry and got an appetizer (that she paid for). In her opinion it was ‚Äúdisgusting‚Äù that he let her pay for any portion of the date. She went on and on and on how if he can‚Äôt even pay for the date how would he ever support her if she got married. 

Through this experience I realized how disgustingly materialistic she is and how much it‚Äôs ruining our friendship.

EDIT:  okay to add some more context Because I think it‚Äôs needed. My best friend is the woman. Co worker is the man. I didn‚Äôt think co worker expected this to be a full blown dinner. It wasn‚Äôt a situation where the bill came at the end of the night and he asked her to put her credit card down. They were just going back and forth. He got a drink before she even came. She came after work, was hungry and he wasn‚Äôt and she ordered an app. He then got a second round of drinks.
She made it sound like everything was a test. She said even if it was the second date she would offer to pay but wouldn‚Äôt expect for the man to even let her.

She made emasculating comments to him during the date saying things like ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not aggressive enough‚Äù.

For those asking why I set up the date?! Because she‚Äôs been single forever and I just wanted her to be happy. But to be honest after this experience I feel like nothing can make her happy as she‚Äôs never experienced any sort of emotional connection with a man. For her it‚Äôs just money. It‚Äôs where can he take me on vacation, what new handbag can he get me, and can he support me when we get married.

One more important detail. They each saw photos of one another before each agreeing to the date. They did not speak until they went on the date.","lol some people just wanna be single forever, yet can't stand being single. you can't help your friends that don't want to be helped. she wasn't going to like him no matter what."
dating,o6i7po,2021-06-23 17:56:07,Is it unreasonable to not want to date people that are having sex with others?,"Hi all,

The title pretty much says it all, I guess. 

Gonna start dating again after about a 7 month break. Probably gonna hold of until August. Here's my problem. I'm fine with the whole online dating thing. I've used it in the past and have had some decent experiences. Unfortunately, I had two very negative ones back to back and now I'm a bit paranoid about dating people that likely/most definitely are dating/sleeping with other people. It never really bothered me before, but some things have happened recently. For people that immediately think I'm being unreasonable, allow me to explain.

About 8 months ago I dated a girl for a month and a half. We went on a date every week and I paid for them all. (no issue there. I really don't mind paying.) We ended up having a movie night which led to sex. Everything was good. Then two days later she told me she'd been dating and sleeping with someone else and that he'd asked her to be his gf. She'd said yes. I was honestly baffled, as I'd have never guessed that, but I just kind of took it in stride and moved on. No negative words said to her or anything. (Their relationship apparently didn't work out. She added me on FB and IG about a month ago and she's single again.)

About two weeks after that, I met another girl. We hit it off immediately and had sex the first night. We hung out a lot but she went back and forth as to whether she wanted a relationship, so after about 2 months we called it quits. A month and a half went by and she asked me to hang out again. Pretty much confessed her love for me and told me how much she'd missed me and that she wants to try to make something work. I was cool with that. I really liked her too.

A few months went by and we had a lot of really good times together. One night she decides to tell me that in the month and a half that we were apart she'd been sleeping with someone else. She wouldn't normally have brought it up, except she was afraid she'd gotten chlamydia.

Now, before I go any further, I did sleep with two other people during that time frame as well. But, I wore a condom each time and actually got tested after. 

So, I was like ""well, whatever. It sucks, but I was having sex with other people too."" And then she told me that she hadn't been tested and hadn't made him wear a condom. So, I was pretty pissed, but chlamydia isn't the end of the world. We waited for her test results and they came back negative. Fast forward about 3 days and I feel a weird bump on myself while showering. TA-Dah. It's Molluscum Contagiosum. A viral STD that is notoriously difficult to get rid of. So, I told her. And she found bumps on herself as well. That was kind of the beginning of our downward spiral, as she was planning on moving, has commitment issues and changes her mind every two days, and I honestly just don't trust her anymore. We mutually ended things.

Fast forward, the Molluscum is now under control and is pretty much entirely cleared up. Dermatologist cleared me, but I think I found some very small ones. Gonna wait for those to disappear and go a few weeks/month bump free before I start dating again. 

My issue is that this whole thing has really tested my fucking sanity. The past two months have been absolutely miserable and I don't ever want to deal with it again. The last two girls I've ""dated"" haven't really worked out too well on my end, and I don't really know if I want to date people that are potentially sleeping with other people. That being said, I'd feel kind of stupid for asking on like the second or third date, ""hey, so are you fucking anyone?"" 

If that's not an unreasonable question to ask, then maybe I'll give the online thing a try again. Before all this, I really had no problem dating women that might be having sex with other people. Especially when I didn't feel that much chemistry with them. I did the same thing, and I would be a hypocrite to expect different behavior from them. But, Idk. I'm getting to the point where I'd kind of just like to settle down with someone I really care about, but I'm realizing that I'd find it pretty difficult to build a healthy relationship with someone that might be sleeping with other people. Especially with the shit I've dealt with for the past 8 months.

Long Story Short; I've had some not so savory experiences with dating, and want to know if my changing philosophy is warranted? If I'm being unreasonable, then probably online dating is off the table. Is there a better way to communicate this to a new potential partner?","Nope, it's absolutely valid and reasonable.  That's one of your boundaries so you set it from the get go.  Honestly if I was on a first date with a guy who told me he wasn't looking to date more than one person at a time or he isn't interested in sleeping with more than one person, I'd totally respect it.  And as someone who also wants to settle down, would be pretty happy to hear it in all honesty."
dating,jtyg6p,2020-11-14 07:57:56,I (M22) freaked out when a girl (F26) started obsessing over me after sex.,"Ahhh I don‚Äôt like this situation.

I‚Äôve (M22) been talking to this girl (F26) for a month. I like her and really enjoy talking with her. Tonight we had our third date. It was a normal fun time, we went back to her place and started having sex. She kept stopping and it turned out this was triggering PTSD from a sexual assault she had had a few months earlier. I stopped and just listened to her and cuddled. I let go of the idea of having sex since it didn‚Äôt seem to be something that she would have a good time with. 

We kept hanging out and then suddenly she started riding me and we got into it and had a great time. Later we were laying in bed and she started telling me how she appreciated me listening to her and not freaking out. 

 That was nice of her to say, but she kept saying it for ten minutes and then she started going into how amazing of a person I was. And I couldn‚Äôt figure how to make it stop. She just kept saying how incredible I was, I‚Äôve never wanted someone complementing me to stop so badly. 

I froze up and then she started referring to me as ‚Äúbabe.‚Äù I tried to reciprocate some compliments, but I couldn‚Äôt say anything to the depths of what she was saying. I like this person, but on the spot I can‚Äôt say she‚Äôs one of the most amazing humans I‚Äôve ever met. And I didn‚Äôt know what she wanted from me, but I wanted to get out so badly. She kept saying ‚ÄúI wish you understood how incredible and how unique you are.‚Äù I made an excuse of needing to get home because I live with my parents and they‚Äôre conservative so I can‚Äôt spend the night.

She was obviously on the edge of tears. I didn‚Äôt know what to do. But she obviously felt rejected because I didn‚Äôt say the same things as her. It was so uncomfortable and now I don‚Äôt know how to process this. 

I feel like there are some pieces of me wrong where I got so uncomfortable hearing over the top complements, but I think she was really affected by me being kind to her when she was being triggered. 

I don‚Äôt know what just happened, can anyone help?  And why did I freak out so much?

Just for people reading and judging this girl, she was already in counseling and she didn‚Äôt expect this to trigger anything. She was not looking for me to be her savior, I think these feelings just came up and she didn‚Äôt know what to do.

If anyone is still reading this post I texted her saying that we should take things slower and I like her, but not as much as what she‚Äôs feeling. She texted back explaining that she had drank a lot more than she realized and was really drunk and started puking after I left. She said that she just got caught up in the moment  and the huge amount of alcohol she had. 

I hope that‚Äôs the complete truth and hopefully puts an end to this weird situation.","She was vulnerable, and abused. When you showed care and empathy, she felt alot better than before. Now is addicted to that feeling of comfort and safespace, she jumped hurdles and boundaries and got attached to you.

I repeat, she is indeed very vulnerable. And if you leave out of the blue, she might get ever more hurt. Just be a nice guy and explain exactly what you feel and what cringed you. Explain to her why it's not healthy for her to fall for you so quick. 

And if she still continues this, despite you explaining all this to her. Block and forget her, she's probably somebody not mentally stable and it's not for you help her any futher."

Lately I've started ""warning"" potential dates that I've been identified as a bad texter. But in real life, I love to have a lively conversation, to ask questions and overall have a good time. 

I completely dislike this social construct of texting and dating. Like someone can say all of the right things through text, but be a whole different person when you meet them?

dating,hzwium,2020-07-29 07:42:49,It saddens me that dating is something I have to emotionally numb myself and it is exhausting,"I am the sort of person that invests a lot of myself in the people I care about, give my everything to the small number of people I keep in my life.

For this reason I find dating very emotionally draining, I have to constantly battle between not investing and giving too much to someone and also giving just enough to keep it going. I prefer to date 1 person at time, see how it goes, if it doesn't work out move onto the next person, as I really don't have the energy to do anymore, but I know that the girls I date will likely be speaking to and dating multiple people, I'm just an option, I am in a disadvantaged position constantly. When I find someone I like I put a lot of effort in, that doesn't mean taking things too fast, it just means I take great care in understanding them and getting to know each other better, but nowadays this again sets me up for failure, you can't be too interested in someone.

Each time I've dated I've just given up out of exhaustion. I hate being something I'm not, and I feel like what I am just isn't suited to dating nowadays.","Im F24, and I feel the same.  
Recently I've dated a guy and I was restraining myself at first because it seemed he is not over his ex yet. I also have had only bad experiences with relationships so far so I am extra careful. Few things happened, and he made me think he wants to be with me. So I started investing. I started to get feelings. He stopped speaking to me from one day to the other and a week later I find out he is with his ex on vacation. Hurts a lot. Reminds me on how careful one has to be.   


But I've seen when two people meet that actually match, and both wanted to give everything. Its really cute, and you can just feel it. So don't give up. And listen to your gut feeling, I believe it tells you right away if the other person is worth it or not. Its a very clear feeling you just have to trust yourself. Maybe that saves you some time.   


Don't lose hope. :)"

Women always tell me size doesn‚Äôt matter, but when they describe the men they have sex with who, according to their descriptions are likely around the same size as myself, they make it very clear that those men were less than satisfying, and were very critical about their disappointment in their satisfaction. Their tone often implies it‚Äôs somehow the man‚Äôs fault for being smaller than she appreciates. 

So, when I hear my female friends describe their experiences with men I hear them loud and clear. I don‚Äôt match up with the guys they want.

dating,iqwfrb,2020-09-11 18:36:34,A week's worth of dates... Or not?,"So I need to send out a thank you to this sub because without it I would not have been prepared for this week.
I arranged to have four 1st dates this week. The 1st one was on Tuesday and it was lovely, he was kind, sincere, smart and funny and we had lovely banter and chemistry.

Then Wednesdays date came around and he canceled due to a corona scare. I didn't mind, as he did try to reschedule but this city will be in lockdown by the time we could meet.

Then Thursday's date stopped messaging me by midafternoon on Thurs and by that evening I'd determined that he'd ghosted me and I instead had a relaxing night in.

Then there's tonight's hot mess of a night. The man in question has been messaging me all day, sending endless selfies of himself around the city. He seemed sweet if not a bit eager. I arrived at our agreed location on time, having given him plenty of warning where I was and when I'd get here. He wasn't here and after a few mins he sent a text to say he was on the way. His last message was ""are you sitting down?"" and then he blocked me on WhatsApp and tinder. So I got stood up, on purpose.

If I'd not spent a while in this sub and seen how often people get ghosted, stood up and have their dates cancelled, I would not have been expecting any of these things to occur and I would have been devastated by them. Instead, I'm actually quite comfortably sitting here at the restaurant, enjoying a good meal on my own, because I know that people do shitty things, and it's not a reflection of me or my value as a date, woman or romantic partner. 

So thank you Redditers for keeping me sane!",So when are you going to have a second date with Mr. Tuesday?
dating,nmckul,2021-05-27 17:24:46,My GF dumped me on Tuesday...but...,"After dating a few months my girlfriend dumped me. I wasn't exactly blindsided since she had been very cold and distant the past few weeks. Past couple weeks I had helped her around her place, installing some curtain hangars and helping her move some furniture, but she wasn't exactly affectionate and the sex had dropped off. She was finishing up school and a friend visited her for a few days last week so I figured she was just busy and exhausted and wanted to give her some space. Maybe she had gotten a little too familiar and sick of me. Well my guess was right.

Nonetheless I liked her and I felt very hurt, sad and kind of used. I took some time off work just to spend some time with myself to mediate, rest and get re-centered. I went for a walk, did some exercises at home and lit some incense. Last night going to bed I finally felt like my emotional malaise was beginning to lift just a bit.

Then this morning on my way to work I got a DM notification on Instagram. It was from a very attractive woman that I met a couple years ago who asked if I wanted to have dinner and catch up. We had chemistry but timing wasn't in our favor a few years back. Must've been some weird form of kismet because there's no way from social media that she heard I was single again. I said yes and she was so excited and appreciative that it completely caught me off guard. My ex was kind, but she never really showed a lot of excitement when I'd come over or ask to see her and compliments were few and far in between. It often felt like more of a chore for her. I'm not assuming anything will happen with this other woman but it was just nice to have some confirmation again that I'm something to be excited about.

dating,jgkeju,2020-10-23 10:13:53,Focusing on myself made me not miss relationships,"For the past 5 years, I've been in such a difficult time emotionally and mentally due to my depression and frustration.

I became so frustrated at life that I thought life owed me a lot. I struggled to meet new people and I struggled to meet and date girls ( I still do and I've been single for 6 years).

I became so envious of everyone having one night stands and being in a relationship that I use to be angry about people having sex and I'm not.

Anyways, I started working on myself and focus on on my studies ( my current GPA is 4.0/4.0), my friends are inviting me a lot over and I've been gyming and I'm feeling good.

I'm at a point now, where I don't care about other people's opinions and what they think and I'm not phased about relationships anymore.

Deep down, I am focusing on myself and making myself happy and if I meet someone, I hope she will accept me the way I am.

I hope that one day someone can look at me and be proud of me and feel lucky that I'm hers. Until then, I'm not bothered by anything and I'm truly happy with myself.

Thanks reddit for all the awesome tips that you've been giving people. I learn a lot. You guys are awesome!","Awesome man

>I'm at a point now, where I don't care about other people's opinions and what they think and I'm not phased about relationships anymore.

Believe it or not, this makes you more attractive to women. When meet you someone, remember to keep this same mentality. Don't get swayed by a women's opinion of you... This is where a lot of guys mess up.... They often think ""oh no, if I do this, she will not like me"". That's wrong

If you mix this strategy with

dating,pqes0h,2021-09-18 03:18:52,I feel guilty about thinking about breaking up with my girlfriend because she doesn‚Äôt have the same sex drive as me. I can‚Äôt take it anymore.,"I‚Äôm currently sitting in her bathroom. She always ‚Äúfalls asleep‚Äù when we are both on the couch when I start to move my hands around. She‚Äôll say ‚Äúmy stomach‚Äù, ‚Äúmy head‚Äù, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so tired‚Äù, ‚Äúmy neck‚Äù, ‚Äúmy back‚Äù, ‚Äúmy toe‚Äù‚Ä¶ and then fall asleep. It happens often and then she wakes up wondering why I‚Äôm not trying anything anymore and asks me ‚Äúwhy are you on your phone?‚Äù

We are supposed to move in together on a 1 year lease on November 1st. And idk if I can handle this for a full year. 

Should I feel guilty about wanting to break up with my girl because she doesn‚Äôt satisfy my sexual needs? (We are intimate with each other, just not often as I‚Äôd like)","One thing I've learned over the years -- if things are bad now, they will not get better by themselves. 

Unless you're willing to do the work (therapy, possibly), then get out. It'll be better for both of you. 

Definitely do not sign the lease. It's a hard conversation to have but the alternative is worse."

By default, I expected he was going to pick the bar.

At noon on Saturday, I texted him asking to let me know where we were going to meet. About two hours to our date, he tells me he's got a terrible hangover. I asked if he wanted to reschedule, but he says no. At this point, I still don't know where we're meeting. An hour to the date, he asks to meet at this dodgy not-so-nice park. I'm dressed nicely with nice makeup on. I'm not into the park meet. Finally thirty minutes to the date, he proposes bar xyz. I told him I wasn't in the mood for the date anymore and that I wished he had been more organized. My friends insisted he only wanted to get laid, and that if he had romantic interest, he would've tried harder.",100%. I'm fuckin happy you bailed on him. Thank you. Do that shit.
dating,saaq8g,2022-01-22 20:00:39,Every time I go to a Meetup event I‚Äôm strongly reminded why Dating Apps are trash.,"30 year old guy here and typically dating has always been pretty hard for me as a black guy and only 5‚Äô8 in height, but last night I went to a meetup event and the results were night and day. 

I went to this bonfire meetup event on the beach and it was my first time with this group. There were maybe 100 people there and everyone was pretty friendly. Within about 20 minutes I was already taking with a woman who approached me. We casually spoke throughout the night and even spoke with a couple other women as well. Met some cool guys too and we just ate food, drank and talked for a few hours. The night ended with a spontaneous make out session with the first girl I had met earlier and we exchanged numbers. 

Damn, I couldn‚Äôt believe how much easier it is to talk to people face to face instead of online and dealing with superficial bullshit and ghosting 24/7. In person people can immediately appreciate your smile and sense of humor. Kinda crazy the people you can meet once you get off the apps üòÇ

dating,wv3me0,2022-08-22 20:03:32,Uncircumcised guy ruined date because of extreme phimosis.,"&#x200B;

Ok, hear me out. With all the recent talks about how boys shouldn't be circumcised at birth and everything, I feel like what happened during my date is relevant and I need to hear your opinions.

I met this guy on tinder a couple weeks ago, my bio clearly states that I'm looking for casual only, I have something on the lines of ""please drag me out to have a good time"". And I have a couple of suggestive pics showing cleavage.

So I match with this guy, empty bio as usual, but we start talking and I start flirting and sending hot pics to him and the guy is totally into it and we start sexting intensely and making plans for a hot date.

Then, after a week of full on sexting, we exchanged full nudes and I could see his dick, I noticed that he wasn't circumcised and that was fine by me, I have been with others that were not circumcised as well.

&#x200B;

We went to the beach together on the day of the date, then we went to his place, because he lived nearby, and we stepped in the shower together because it was a very hot day and we were sweating. But in the shower I started smelling something weird, and I thought it was just the usual odor from the sink at those houses that are at the coast.

&#x200B;

But when I tried to touch him to start some sexy time in the shower he pushed my hand away and kinda said that he didn't like it when girls touched his dick and stuff. But with all the things we have talked about I still offered to suck him a bit and knelt in front of him. And I swear, his dick was the source of the weird odor, it reeked of ammonia! I had never seen a dick that smelled so bad! I had to stand back and say something like, ""I think you need to wash, after being at the beach everything‚Ä¶""

&#x200B;

So when I said that, he kinda looked ashamed and told me to go back to the room, and that he would finish and go in a minute. Since I had already washed myself and I was perfectly clean, I left.

But at the bedroom, when he returned, I wanted to start the sexy time, and again I tried to go down on him, and his thighs and balls reeked of pee!! So, in preparation for this date, not only did he not wash his dick on the inside, he also forgot to wash his croth too? like, he did not wash his skin with soap??

He tried to get me to suck him and do all the nasty things we said we wanted to do during sexting, but I just couldn't, it's been weeks and I still have the smell in my nose! 

Yet, I was nice and I played it off and tried to jerk him instead but he again wouldn't let me touch his dick for that. The head of his dick wasn't even poking or anything, it was hard but rather small, and it was fully covered in skin. Like the orifice at the tip of the foreskin was so small that he probably couldn't even put a finger there to wash.

&#x200B;

So I just wanted to finish and leave by then and told him to put on a condom and to fuck instead, but when he tried to put on a condom his dick went completely limp. Like I was naked in his bed, looking my best, clean and shaved, I even put on perfume and lip gloss while I waited for him to finish showering, and this guy couldn't even keep his dick hard enough to put on a condom.

After the 3rd dried up condom he just gave up, and we laid there in bed, for a moment, where he apologized and literally said ""welcome to the club of disappointed girls""

&#x200B;

I was stunned, I was in fucking disbelief. This man, 25 years old, not only couldn't wash his dick properly, he couldn't even take a proper shower with soap to wash himself for a willing partner that had already told him that was ready to suck his uncircumcised dick! 

I'm sorry, and I'm not doctor, but if you have a phimosis so extreme that you don't want girls to touch your dick, that you can't wash your dick properly, and that you can't even put on a condom to fuck‚Ä¶ shouldn't you be considering the surgery to get circumcised??

&#x200B;

This is not in the US, we have free socialized healthcare and this man's parents own 2 restaurants, he's not poor and the surgery would be free here for such extreme cases, like he clearly can't even have normal sex. I didn't say anything and just thanked him for the date when I left, but Jesus Christ, we ha been talking for a full week about just fucking and I had to go home to fuck myself.

&#x200B;

So, what do you guys think?? It's not my business and I won't tell this guy to go get the surgery unprompted, but if he asks about what went wrong that day, I fully intend to let him know that his dick smells of ammonia and to see a doctor. 

&#x200B;

For more context I'll say that I'm a woman. My profile and nude pics were taken a few days prior to the date and without filters, I was showing myself just as I am. But I have never seen such phimosis before, and I have no medical experience of any kind, I just wanted to suck some dick and get fucked.

&#x200B;

Edit: after reading many comments about people saying that he just doesn't know how to wash, sorry if I didn't explain well, but I'm under the impression this man is unable to pull the skin back, at all, to the point that he's scared of women touching his dick to try and pull back.

I will also say that I did not laugh or mock him in any way, I was compassionate and understanding, but I'm not his girlfriend and I do not owe him anything, really.",[deleted]
dating,ul3p0u,2022-05-08 15:07:14,"""I'm a Scorpio...enough said."" No, but thinking your star sign is enough said, is definitely enough said.","Curious how many people here think that they can determine whether to date someone based solely or even mainly on their astrological sign.

Versus cringing and quickly noping people who lead with their sign.

Edit: A number of people seem frustrated that astrology isn't being taken seriously here.  I made a followup post below where you are welcome to guess my sign to prove astrology is accurate.  After 30 guesses, I'll reveal my sign and add it here, along with the results.  Have fun.","Whenever someone tells me their astrological sign, I have to look it up and then guess what they‚Äôre alluding to.

dating,nnfd5p,2021-05-29 04:20:56,"I can handle straight rejection, but being led on and ghosted? Hits like a brick.","So many posts here are about ghosting. Just adding another rant. Rejection is obviously something everyone experiences at least once in their lives unless they avoid relationships or hit the jackpot and marry their first love interest. Doesn't mean there's anything wrong with you if someone turns you down; you just aren't compatible. He/she doesn't like you back? At least you shot your shot and can move on. 

But say someone is actually into you, or at least they appear to be. You tell them your intentions and they say they want to get to know you better and see where things go. Not exactly a rejection, right? So you continue to talk and develop a deeper connection until they one day disappear. Usually it's because they're afraid of commitment or found someone they liked better. But at this point you were already forming a relationship of some sort with that person for months only to find out you were on entirely different pages. Even if you saw it coming, it still hurts like hell. It feels like a breakup even if you weren't official.

So what do you do then? Move on, obviously. But unfortunately for people like me (8 months and going wtf), moving on isn't that easy. Rejections like these are closer aligned to being broken up with in a way. It's not the same as asking someone out and them telling you ""No thanks."" People like them are ex-somethings, ex-almosts, ex-maybes. And while it never would have worked out, it's hard to get over the blatant disrespect and realization that you were played.

(Yes, I'm serious when I say I'm still grieving after 8 months. I'm 17 and this was my first greater-than-a-crush kind of thing. I already have a realistic viewpoint on the situation but my unhealthy attachment persists to this day. It'd be easier if I could go out again and meet new people.)",[deleted]
dating,epqwd6,2020-01-16 22:35:38,"""No matter how attractive a person's potential may be","...you have to date their reality.""

I just read that and it hit home. Thought I'd share it.

I just recently dated someone who simply wasn't ready to get involved with *anyone* because of a recent breakup. 

I had (or if I'm honest still have to some degree) a hard time dealing with the fact that timing just wasn't in our favor because we really clicked and I was so sad over the fact that it just wasn't meant to be.

But the thing is... Sometimes things just can't work out.

No matter how good you two would be together, how much you click, how much chemistry you have with each other, how attracted you are to each other, how well you fit together...

Sometimes it's just not meant to be because your realities just don't match up. For reasons unknown.

It's nobody's fault really. It's not that you're not good enough. It's not that you did or say something wrong. Sometimes timings a bitch. Sometimes the other person isn't in the right emotional state. Sometimes their circumstances get in the way. Whatever.

And in that moment your self respect has to be stronger than your feelings.

Don't beg. Don't discuss it. Don't force yourself back into their lives. Don't argue.

They probably made a healthy decision for themselves. Even if you can't wrap your head around it. Most of the time it's probably not an easy decision for them either. But it's probably a healthy one for you too. Whether you know it or not, you probably wouldn't want to be involved with them while whatevers going on, that prevents you from being with them, is going on, anyway.

So let them go.

Maybe you'll find each other again under the right circumstances - but don't count on it. Let them go completely and just live your life. Close this chapter and open a new one.",[deleted]

dating,nysrsg,2021-06-13 09:33:42,I probably had the most frustrating date ever.,"I've had been talking to this girl through Tinder and that went over to Whatsapp quite fast. We've been talking constantly for about 3-4 months, Had a lot of fun. Actually had the feeling that it was going somewhere. We decided to go on ''date'' due to corona the restaurants and movies were closed. So i decided we can make it a Home date. (Just to add onto it, She never had been at my home and she and I only seen each other once before for a very short time. But i thought i knew her quite well)  


So I had been cooking, dinner literally for over an hour just to make it feel like we were actually ''out'' and I just said ''I hope you like it, I tried my best'' She had 3 or 4 bites and she said ''Nope, I'm not eating that, Doesn't taste good'' I was incredibly ashamed at that point and was just already like ''Wtf am i supposed to do now'' going forward I had the movie started, which we BOTH chose and were like... This seems like a good movie.. I had some snacks ready, chips and just soda's... Kinda the normal stuff to enjoy off the side.. 10-20 minutes pass... Bowl empty, we're talking about 200-300g of chips just gone... I'm a big eater too and I don't really care, but I was kinda already in a pissy mood after that first comment... Then she decided to just decide for herself and quite literally RAID my supply closet with snacks that i keep for any occassion... WITHOUT ASKING. I'm quite the guy that just goes straight for it... and asked in a subtle way ''Don't take everything please, I'd still like some'' She just smiled and took a second bowl and put in new chips in it and gave it to me and said ''Now we don't have to share!'' SHE DECIDED THAT WE WOULDNT HAVE TO SHARE MY FOOD/SNACKS. The movie was still going on and i was just trying to focus on it at this point. 3/4 movie is almost done (This is 2 hours later). She goes ''Hm I don't like it we should watch something else'' just takes the remote and changes to a different movie... I was just literally baffled... sitting in silence thinking ''She will be gone after this movie, just chill'' Nothing really much happens other than that i got annoyed by chewing sounds (I have mysophony, I'm extremely sensitive to chewing, pen scribbling etc..) The movie was over i closed the Netflix and the moment i closed it .... ''Well that movie sucked too, but i guess it was fun...''  


I was at my limits at this point, but i champed through... It was 12:00pm and she goes... ''Oh shoot, I have a problem'' Her bus... was cancelled and was only going to be driving again at 6am... And she had to STAY IN MY HOME TO SLEEP OVER AND IM THE IDIOT THAT LETS HER BECAUSE I AM SOMETIMES TO NICE AND I HATE IT.   


Also when she was going to sleep over. Instantly hid my expensive stuff in my room where i was sleeping. (Nintendo Switch, Console, Phones etc) My mindset was literally ''She can sleep here, but im not going to be robbed tonight'' Everything set, I gave her a blanket and some pillows on my couch (Yes, she looked very disappointed, when i didn't invite her to my bed. zero emotion on my face)  


The night goes past, I wake up. She's still there (Yay). Made eggs, She ate like 4-5 eggs and then also complained that my eggs sucked. (Cherry on top y'all) Walked her to the bus stop, SHE WENT IN FOR A KISS and just straight up shaked her hand and said a bit too loud.. 'Let's never see each other again'' and made a U-turn and walked back home...

&#x200B;

This is my go-to story if anyone asks why I don't have a relationship yet..   


Also I'm sorry if i made some mistakes in my text... Not a native english speaker.",I cannot believe the entitlement of this person. I just can‚Äôt. I hope your last message to her left a lasting impression...

I said yes. He didn't have a fever but had chills, headache and nausea. So, I gave him Theraflu, soup, tea and put him to sleep.  I also bake him chocolate chip cookies (only because he asked...lol.). I did lecture him that cookies aren't good if you're sick.  Anyway, I think this is a positive sign that he trusts me as he comes to me in time of need. I am a nurturer by nature. So, I'm glad that he's here. He knows I love him even though we don't say it to each other.
UPDATE: I confiscated his phone. He said not to do this but he's sick and a workaholic. If his boss calls, I'll wake him but otherwise he needs to rest.
UPDATE 2: A lot of you should know that we are both guys. I see some comments referring to me as a ""she""...lol. Also, he just left, he's still sick but he's doing the typical tough guy and going to work. I told him if it gets too much he can come back.","One tine a guy I was dating got really sick while I was over  at his to hangout. We'd only been going out a few months. He started burning up, getting chills and a headache. I made him go get under the covers, ordered him food. I walked out to the nearest convenience store and bought electrolytes, painkillers, and Gatorade. Came back and prepared his food once it arrived. Made sure he took a hot shower and was hydrated. I slept over and he was hugging me all night because he kept getting chills and I was keeping him warm. He woke up randomly to drink water, waking me up too and the first thing I did was check his forehead to see how his fever was.

dating,uagh26,2022-04-23 22:29:48,"Guys, if you aren't getting matches on Tinder, read this.","I (21M) have been using Tinder for a few months on and off, and so far, I've only gotten two dates and maybe a couple dozen matches in that time. I consider myself decently attractive, but as we all know, the male-to-female ratio on online dating apps is massively skewed towards males. I wanted to see how bad it was for myself, so I decided to do just that. 

I'm not a super masculine-looking guy by any means. All I had to do was throw on a wig and use a filter to smooth out my features, and I boom, woman. I made a new profile, changed my gender, and I was good to go. I purposefully made my bio and picture look stupid just to see if people would still like me. 

Within the first few hours alone, I already had over 99+ likes. I got more matches in that short amount of time than I ever have as a guy to this point. But I wouldn't necessarily call that a good thing, because almost all of the guys I talked to said the same things. ""wyd"" ""do you have snap"" ""*insert something sexual*"". Nobody was saying or doing anything that seems interesting at all, save for one guy that was actually very nice and genuine. I had to delete it after the first few hours, because it got tiring very fast. 

I don't understand how women do this, and I don't even wanna do it as a guy anymore if I'm being honest. It's just sad. To girls, I'm sorry you have to deal with this stuff. Guys, I'm sorry that you have to be grouped in with the types of shits I had to talk to. This is a cesspool for everyone involved. I urge my fellow dudes to delete Tinder and meet people in the real world, even if it's harder. You'll have way better luck there, trust me. 

TLDR; I catfished on Tinder and everything makes sense now",I wish more women would make fake male profiles to understand what men go through; and vice-versa to understand what women go through. It's eye-opening.
dating,zpc17o,2022-12-18 23:46:47,How do I salvage the fact that I can‚Äôt fuck my girlfriend like her ex did?,"Not going to bore all of you with stuff about how we met so I‚Äôm just going to get into it cause it honestly makes me want to throw up just thinking about it. 

Long story short, me and my girlfriend were hanging out with some friends and we‚Äôre getting drunk and ended up playing truth or dare. And when she picked truth, someone asked her what her favorite sex position was. She answered with a position that as far as I know doesn‚Äôt have a specific name and described it in relatively vivid detail. This is a position we‚Äôve never done so I was a bit upset that she never wanted to try it with me and i was definitely hurt but I ignored it for the sake of the night. Once we got home I asked her about it and she said that the position leaves a fair amount of the dick out, and that because mine was smaller, she wouldn‚Äôt be able to move on it properly and she would only really be trying to maneuver on the head of penis, whereas her ex was much bigger so he was still able to fill her up and hit the right spots even in that position. 

This obviously destroyed me and that must‚Äôve been obvious on my face cause she immediately tried to console me. She-said that sex with me is still great and that it‚Äôs ok we can‚Äôt do everything together she did with him, and that there were still other things we could try. She said that she was happy with our sex life and my size was enough for her, just not for that position. When she woke up she apologized for telling me about it and mentioning something from A past lover with me there. She probably wouldn‚Äôt have but she was drunk and hadn‚Äôt had the forethought to consider how I would feel about it

I want to believe her, but I just can‚Äôt. Our relationship is great outside of this and I‚Äôm very attentive in bed. I give her head, do lots of foreplay and am largely focused on her pleasures because I enjoy it. However I‚Äôm not really able to shake the feeling that I‚Äôm actually inadequate and that she‚Äôs saying I‚Äôm good/big enough just because she likes the other things about our relationship and that secretly she wishes I was her ex. It‚Äôs not even like the ex was some douchebag, things didn‚Äôt work between them, but I know the guy and he‚Äôs a pretty decent dude. I don‚Äôt know what to do, the idea of having sex with her just feels almost revolting at this point and my insecurities are spiking. What can I do to try to move past this? Or is it a lost cause?

Edit: for All of you making jokes saying I‚Äôm immature and that size isn‚Äôt everything. I know, and it‚Äôs not the fact that he was bigger that‚Äôs the problem, but that he was BETTER. And I can‚Äôt hope to replicate it, because I wasn‚Äôt born with enough.

Edit 2: everyone saying, it doesn‚Äôt matter because now she‚Äôs with me and if she wanted him she‚Äôd still be with him is just wrong. The breakup was mutual, but initiated by him and even if she wanted him to stay he wouldn‚Äôt have. She understood why it had to happen but he was the one who was ready to move on first.","Damn dude. That sucks. I‚Äôd feel the exact same way as you. I don‚Äôt have any advice from experience but shit the success of this relationship probably comes down to if you really love her and can get over this mindfuck to the point where it doesn‚Äôt interfere with your relationship, chemistry, and sex life. Good luck brother."
dating,10h3cki,2023-01-20 17:50:29,I walked away from a date because the girl said ''you're attractive despite being short'',"Long story short: I'm 30, I'm an Italian man and I'm 5'9. I moved to America a few years ago, I found a job here after University. I think Americans are friendly, cool people and the country undoubtedly has a lot of beautiful places, 

but the height obsession in this country is  simply absurd from the point of view of an outsider, and I do not want to date anyone any woman here anymore, I think I want to fly back to Europe and that's a shame because I actually like everything else in America, but not the dating game.

I went on a date with this girl, the date was going well and we were having fun, at some point though she said ''you're very attractive despite being a little short'', I walked away after she said that, immediately. She tried to apologize, but that was absolutely a deal breaker for me, then she tried to text me and apologize, she said ''you're good-looking and you have other qualities that are more important than your height'' and I was like ''no madam, I do not want to feel like I need other qualities to compensate for my lack of height, because my height isn't a flaw''

 The average man in Italy is 5'9 - 5'10, which means that even in my country I'm not considered tall (but 5'9 is average and totally acceptable in Italy), the main difference is that women and  most people just do not care about height.  

False modesty aside, I'm not ugly at all, and I lost the count of how many times in Italy I was the shortest guy in a room or at a party, yet I was the one being stared at or hit on,  but this isn't just Italian women, this is most southern Europeans,  I went on a dinner with a few Spanish and Southern American friends some time ago, I hadn't moved to America yet, there were taller guys at the table, but the girls were just paying attention to me and ignoring the other guys because they evidently thought I was the most attractive one despite not being the tallest.

&#x200B;

 I think that this heightism is just a cultural thing in the US/Canada and Southern European countries, but to me it's a very shallow metric to measure someone's attractiveness, I see a lot of dudes walking around with a perfect posture all the time because they want to show off their height and as an Italian I look at them and think ''dude what the heck relax, you're standing straight like a soldier'' 

I'm not looking for advice, things just are the way they are and I can't expect to change America's culture, I'm just venting, I'll move back to my country and this problem will be solved lol.

I'm a decent looking person with a positive attitude, hard worker, healthy lifestyle who is loyal as fuck...yet...I am constantly ghosted or abandoned for other guys. It's starting to break me mentally. Most of my exes cheated on me, the women I've met the last few months just up and disappear. It makes me lose hope. I'm no one's favorite person and realistically I don't think I ever have been anyone's favorite person. Most of us just want that deep connection and I start to wonder if I'll ever find it. I don't want to hook up, I don't want to end up in abusive situation after abusive situation, and I don't want to fake happiness like so many people I know.

dating,fipb5b,2020-03-14 20:51:45,"What do you want, a cookie for behavior that you should exude by default?","So, I had a date last night. 

We‚Äôll call him Jacob. I‚Äôve texted and talked on the phone with Jacob over the course of 2 weeks or so. He seemed sweet and pretty fun. We finally found the time to set up a date. His use of the word date came as a surprise to me, because I dunno, I‚Äôve been single a long time and I‚Äôm just not used to men actually looking for something other than sex. 

It took me about 3 hours to get ready. Yes, excessive. But, I like to go all out when I‚Äôm happy or feel like I‚Äôm on track. I felt very confident in my appearance, but I wouldn‚Äôt say I was looking for negative attention. Not that that even matters. 

First off, I pull into the restaurant, get out of my car, and BOOM. There he is. It struck me as creepy. I didn‚Äôt tell him what I drive. Second, I find myself feeling awful because I‚Äôve interacted with this dude for weeks, we‚Äôve sent multiple Snapchats back and forth and... I am not attracted to his real life self. I can‚Äôt put my finger on what was different? 

Anyhow, we go in and get seated and he immediately wants to talk about man thing. Cars mostly. That‚Äôs fine and all but I had no idea what he was saying. He didn‚Äôt seem like the type of person that bothers to explain things, he just likes to talk. Maybe he was nervous. 

As the date goes on, he says various things that just aren‚Äôt attractive. He made jokes about jerking off and sex. Just things that generally tend to be an immediate turn off for me. Then, back to hot wiring cars. I think I got whiplash...

He also says that he is recently divorced. So recently, that he signed papers last week. That to me seemed a little swift to be moving back into things. He proceeds to ask me if we can go sit in my car after dinner just to talk more. I don‚Äôt know why all my internal sirens started blaring but I instantly felt uneasy. I kinda swept the question under the rug and deferred to a new subject. 

Dinner is done (and I feel horribly relieved that it‚Äôs almost over) so I ask if he‚Äôs ready to go because I‚Äôm beginning to feel the effects of a migraine. At this point, we go outside and we‚Äôre standing by my car. He brings up the same question he had earlier and I tried to push it off, saying my car was really dirty. He was insistent that he didn‚Äôt care. 

Now, I start getting a little bit defensive... I told him I really just wanted to take dating slowly. He said he respected that, but was obviously very disappointed. He then says he hasn‚Äôt had sex since Thanksgiving. 

Insert meme of crazy haired white lemur raising its hands like ‚Äòwhat the fuck?‚Äô It‚Äôs really not my problem... 
I said my head was hurting and it was time for me to be in bed anyways. 

‚ÄúWell I guess I‚Äôm gonna go beat one out in my truck real quick.‚Äù All I could reply was oh my god... 

He asked for a kiss and I straight up said no. He kinda got a little louder in tone asking why not. All I could get out was ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not really my thing.‚Äù So he asks for a hug. To appease him and go home, I let him have a hug, he did buy me dinner after all. 

Pulling back, he says ‚Äúsee, I didn‚Äôt try to touch your butt or be inappropriate.‚Äù 

I said ‚Äúdo you want a goddamn gold star?‚Äù and I got in my car and left. 

I am never seeing this dude again and as bad as I feel for thinking this, it was a waste of some bomb ass makeup. Needless to say, I am once again back in this same hole I keep trying to crawl out of. I‚Äôm so discouraged.","Many a cringe was had while reading this.

dating,kwl6o4,2021-01-13 17:25:42,I‚Äôd prefer a nightmare over dreaming about a girlfriend honestly :(,"It was one of those nights yesterday: I was cuddling up with some girl I do know irl (my brain picked her for some reason, but I haven‚Äôt seen her in a while nor do I have feelings towards her, the brain is weird).

It was soo cute, it was touchy, it was cutesy; just generally everything I do want in a partner...

... Then I woke up 10 minutes before my alarm was supposed to go off, holding my pillow.

I‚Äôve dated around last year with no succes, I‚Äôve had short-term girlfriends before in high schools and I got called ‚Äúcute‚Äù or something along the lines plenty of times but so far I‚Äôm still single and dating apps are really getting tiring after being on them on and off since I was 18 (20 now).

Getting in contact with woman outside of dating apps is gonna get even harder once college is over as well in about 3 years, since my profession is going to be in IT, specifically being a sysadmin. And so far the three IT companies I did an internship at were sausage fests...

I just want a special somebody man, I just want somebody to cuddle at night and wake up to the next morning. I want passionate sex and be there for each other through thick and thin.

Anyways, to end this vent what I wanted to get at... At least waking up from nightmares is a relieve, but girlfriend dreams make you start of the day sad.",[deleted]
dating,11bkzqo,2023-02-25 13:27:21,What's the weirdest date you've been on? I'll go first,"We were going to see a movie and didn't buy tickets in advance and couldn't get two tickets next to each other so we ended up sitting on opposite sides of the theater and then the movie ended and we were like cool ok bye. lol

How about you?","It‚Äôs a long one‚Ä¶

This guy picked me up and offered me some pot, I declined and he admitted that he had already smoked and was high.

We were supposed to go to a lake and hang out but we didn‚Äôt want to pay for parking so we parked what we thought was like a quarter mile away.

It was 8 miles. I‚Äôm wearing flip flops and a sun dress. This nice old couple picks us up before we‚Äôre a mile in and even offers to drive us back later. 

Well at the parking lot we took the wrong trail and ended up going to the wrong lake and it was freezing compared. When we walked back the parking lot was empty. So we started walking the 8 miles back and it was starting to get dark. (We also realized he locked his phone and keys in the truck and mine died because service was sketchy)

We run into this lady who is literally running with wolves. All the wolves are fucked up, like missing a leg or an eye. She starts yelling that they‚Äôre friendly so we‚Äôre like petting some random ass wolves now. Apparently she rehabs wolves and has to take them on a few mile run several times a day.

We explain our situation and she offers to let us use her phone and follow her back to her house. She starts running through the woods so I‚Äôm chasing after her in my flip flops. 

We get to her house and one of the wolves just runs off and she‚Äôs like ‚ÄúOh no! The neighbors hate it when this happen!‚Äù Like I fucking bet lady. She lets us in her house but it‚Äôs all dark and apparently one of the wolves left a big old pile of shit in the house which my date steps in barefoot. So now were outside hosing his foot off when AAA arrives. 

We get back to the truck and go get Chinese food, go back to his hotel. I regret hooking up with him but I was young‚Ä¶ when we were fooling around he no shit says ‚ÄúWould you like to play with cockasaurus?‚Äù

Edit: I forgot, he‚Äôs not a model or anything but a year later I saw him on the cover of outside magazine and was like OH MY FUCKING GOD ITS COCKASAURUS GUY!!!!!!"
dating,kvjib3,2021-01-12 03:40:27,I‚Äôm done. Taking myself out of the game. ‚Äòcause I‚Äôm not built for this ghosting shit.,"So I (27M) got ghosted four times this week. FOUR FUCKING TIMES! In a week! And it‚Äôs not just the sheer number that really fucked me up. It‚Äôs that I thought things were going well enough. One of them, whom I particularly liked, had even proposed various plans. And when I engaged with those plans, I either got one-word answers or no response at all. So to go from wonderful dates to *nothing* has really made me question whether I know how to assess things. 

Now there is a chance I‚Äôm overreacting. Still, whether I am overreacting or I have been ghosted, either scenario just tells me that I may not be ready to date again. Even in the instance that I may have done something wrong, that makes it clear that dating is not for me‚Äîat least not right now. There‚Äôs no downside to introspection, though the pandemic does make it harder to accept being single (I also live alone, which was GREAT pre-pandemic but sucks donkey booty now‚Äîbut I digress). I‚Äôve deleted all dating apps, and I‚Äôm just going to be single as fuck with my cat. 

Please, let‚Äôs be grown fucking adults about this whole dating thing. If someone is not your vibe, just tell them. They may not be *your* person, but they are *a* person.

dating,snwbc2,2022-02-08 22:07:43,Any other guys dislike when a woman is strongly interested in how much money you make?,"Posted this as a comment on another thread, but wanted to make a discussion here to see if any other guys agree with me.

As a guy, nothing is a bigger turn off then a woman's strong interest in how much money I make. Especially early on. I actually don't like to discuss it on purpose to see how much of a fuss they make about it. Eventually we discuss these things of course, but if it seemed of *major* concern to them before, then even if we're vibing, I'll never let the relationship go anywhere beyond casual. 

It's just insulting, the idea that how much money I make a year determines my romantic value. And I make a decent amount. I'm not rich, I'm not poor. I take care of myself and am not struggling. For me, as long as you know that, then that should be it. 

It's not of concern to me how much a woman I'm interested in makes per year, so I want to date a woman who views me the same way. 

What do you guys think? 

I'd also like to hear the perspective of women on this.

EDIT: Lot of heated debate. I appreciate it, even those who disagree with me. My position is simple: If you wouldn't date me when I was broke, I don't want to date you now that I'm not.

EDIT 2: It is not my implication that *all* women are like this or do this. Not even close. I've had lots of great dates with women who don't care at all. This is just a criticism of the certain women who do and have a strong interest in it.

Last EDIT: I've noticed that mostly all the woman who say they ask about income mention an ex boyfriend that used to leech on them. So shoutout to the broke dudes who take care of themselves and *don't* leech, and fuck you to the dudes who leech on women. Peace out.","It doesn't bother me, but I usually say that I earned enough to live comfortably if she asks for more information some alarms go off"

She really changed his name on Snapchat to a girls name ‚ÄúLisa‚Äù lol and they were best friends (yellow heart). The name should‚Äôve given it away honestly, I‚Äôve never met a Lisa in my fucking life, only one I know is on the simpsons.
Anyways I asked who the girl was a few weeks back, and she mentioned she was just a girl from work, me not really caring said ‚Äúnice‚Äù... 

well guess what... today I went to her work for her birthday surprising her by bringing her flowers, and food for both her and her friends.
And she was only there with a few employees.
 i stayed and talked for a bit, I asked who‚Äôs lisa??mainly doing it to see if it was true.. and sure enough her face looked like she saw a fucking ghost. But shes a lot smarter than I thought, I‚Äôll give her that... with about 10 secs of awkward silence and her actual co-worker just staying silent, acting as if she didn‚Äôt hear me. she said oh she‚Äôs from my old job. Before I met you.... 

cmon. I was born at night, but not last night...

So I decided to leave, she knew I was mad. 
And when she got home I asked who she was really talking to, and she broke down crying saying it was her Ex ... and that he had randomly added her again. 
She claimed she deleted him after that night, and said nothing to put our relationship at harm. 
But now I‚Äôve lost all trust. 
And I feel like an idiot. 
My gut is saying run....
Wwyd?",">texting her ex... She really changed his name on Snapchat to a girls name ‚ÄúLisa‚Äù

That's all I needed to read, leave now. It's obvious she knew she was doing something wrong and she knew (or at least thought) you wouldn't be okay with it, so she attempted to hide it. It's only been 7 months. I know that feels like a long time, it's not, just leave. 

Leave her, tell her why, walk away, and don't even consider looking back.

She'll likely try to smoothe things over ""we were just talking"", ""we're only friends"", ""I needed closure"", ""It was (a mistake / stupid)"", ""I wasn't thinking"", ""I don't know what I was thinking"", etc. She may have friends and or family (hers and or yours) try to talk to you for her.

We went out and and she asked what I did in my spare time and I said the usual stuff ""hang out with friends, family, listen to music, watch movies"" but I also said ""play video games"" and she got really weirded out by that, saying that video Games are ""for kids"" and someone my age should not be playing them.

I completely disagree with that view, like movies or any other entertainment medium, some video games can be for kids and some for adults 

I wasn't rude or anything but I politely disagreed with her and explained how many games made now have huge cinematic like intricate plots and intense adult gameplay and require lateral thinking and all sorts of problem solving skills.

She didn't agree and basically said that it was weird for someone in their 30s to play video games. Long story short, I never got a second date with her.

In situations where your date expresses a viewpoint you disagree with, like this, do you find it easier to just agree with them to keep the peace or to politely stand your ground?

It destroyed me. Getting over it was one of the hardest things I ever had to do but I did it. I was over it at about the 4 month mark and now I don‚Äôt even think about it anymore. 

I have finally had the opportunity to test the waters and indeed there are many fish in the sea!

Now I also know you might think of me keeping the breakup date in my mind weird but I thought of it as the day the old me died and was reborn. I made this post for anybody who feels undesirable, going through a breakup or dating in general. I by no means am a ladies man, I do have spurts of loneliness as well.

Particularly in the last 10 years. I‚Äôm 27F. It‚Äôs pretty cutthroat and not for the faint of heart. 

Ghosting - painful asf but normalized. 

Hook up culture is normalized- barely anyone wants a committed relationship anymore. 

Picky/Quick to reject  - the plethora of people on  dating apps have allowed people to become extremely picky and almost unrealistic in some cases. Standards are good, keep them, but looking for ‚Äúperfect‚Äù is looking for something that doesn‚Äôt exist. 

‚ÄúGrass is greener‚Äù mentality- don‚Äôt want to commit because they are always afraid something ‚Äúbetter‚Äù will come along. 
*the grass is greener where you water it* üòâ

Jaded/skittish- everyone is so burnt by their past bc they don‚Äôt allow themselves to heal and become so skittish and fickle

Online s*xual harrassment- many men thinks it‚Äôs okay to send unsolicited, explicit, disrespectful messages to women. And bc it‚Äôs online- it for the most part goes unpunished.

No/Low effort- Many individuals think they should be hunted down and don‚Äôt feel the need to match your energy

Entitlement- many individuals think they are deserving of things they‚Äôre not. 
Men it‚Äôs ‚ÄúBecause I bought you a $15 meal, you know owe me dat booty.‚Äù 
Women it‚Äôs ‚ÄúBecause I‚Äôm pretty, you owe me free meals.‚Äù

Dating has *never* been easy but I don‚Äôt think our grandparents had to go through ALL of this buffoonery

EDIT: Don‚Äôt get too hung up on whether you think our grandparents had it better/worse. 
The question is in the title üòä

EDIT: Yes, traumatic is the word I am using. And here is
why.
Traumatic per dictionary - *in psychiatry*
psychologically painful or distressing

Trauma - an experience that produces psychological
injury or pain often with lasting emotional affects.

I believe trauma has a spectrum. 
Also, believe that what is not traumatic to one, may deeply traumatize the next. 

We all have different tolerances.
So to objectively argue that dating is not traumatic as
a factual is undermining those of us who have had
some truly awful experiences in dating, to the point
where some of us need therapy and a shoulder to cry
on when your (oops i mean their..) 50 minutes is up
lol
Now the question is do *you* find dating traumatic? If
you don't, then you don't so your answer would be
no, but don't be too objective about it.

You‚Äôre pushing a harmful stereotype. Okay so most guys that are single have their lives mostly together.

I‚Äôm not greasy fat guy living in his moms basement that‚Äôs surprised that Zendaya won‚Äôt bang me.

And constantly I see people here and many other subs assume that if a guy is struggling with dating is an entitled neck beard. It‚Äôs shitty.

There‚Äôs nothing wrong with being a single virgin, but obviously if you are you don‚Äôt know how to clean yourself. That‚Äôs so shitty to say.

If you can't even define what a ""spark"" is, you're throwing away your dating life.

I'm going to put this as kindly as I can without swearing at you people... you're all insane. You're crazy. Absolute lunatics.
You met the person on a dating app, you have no prior knowledge of their existence and you're both awkward. That's cool, that's fine... but dont expect the sky to open up and a magical connection to be bestowed upon you. 
Relationships take time and work in order to connect and understand the other person. This doesnt mean invest EVERYTHING into a random hinge match, but it does mean that you should invest more into your best matches. If you had a ""good date"" but you just ""didn't feel it"" then you are NORMAL. Welcome to reality. Try being friends with them, get to the point where neither of you are afraid of being ghosted by each other. I can almost guarantee you you'll find that ""spark"".

Thank you for all the kind responses :)","I don't necessarily agree with everyone trying to tell you that you should've walked away instantly. You caught feelings and you wanted to make things work. Isnt that really the point of a relationship and the process of getting into one?

There was nothing wrong with what you did. You're a very kind and caring person. He was just an ass. Everything seems obvious in hindsight. It's called hindsight for a reason. Chin up. The ability to try and make things work will be worth it when the person opposite you appreciates and reciprocates it."
dating,gva40c,2020-06-02 16:09:03,"Dating conversation tip: practice ""deep listening"" ‚Äî here's how","This is a tip for people who struggle with conversation from time to time.

Try to practice ""deep listening"" ‚Äî this means allowing people to say what‚Äôs on their mind and listening to it with real curiosity and attention, without waiting for your turn to talk. Then ask questions that reflect back what the person is saying.

It may seem obvious to some, but others have the tendency to start thinking about their response while the other person is still talking. If you focus on listening rather than crafting your own response, conversation will come more naturally.

Do you have any tips for better listening and conversation flow?","...add ""active listening"" to that list. 

If people don't understand what I tell them, I rephrase that and let them know ""you gotta study your person of interest to the most detail and depth you can imagine, as if you're writing an exam about them tomorrow"". I live by this motto and so far, I have nurtured a few, but very powerful and strong bonded (both romantic and platonic) relationships."
dating,e268re,2019-11-26 22:56:20,Trying to find a significant other in 2019 is like trying to discover antibiotics during the bubonic plague,"I'm telling you man.

It's like this balancing act. Well, before the balancing act it's trying to find someone you share some kind of interest in, be it physical or emotional attraction. If you're lucky, both.

Then you gotta be in the right PLACE at the right TIME...

K, then you like each other. You hang out. Then you suppress emotions so you don't scare the other off, so you overthink. ""They haven't responded yet, fuck are they ghosting me?"" ""They're probably just sleeping"" ""If you don't stop thinking about them you're gonna jinx it"" ""Did I jinx it"" ""Oh wait, everything's chill"" ""I just hung out with them it's fine"" ""I like them but I can't tell them because it'll freak 'em out"" ""The sex was AMAZING"" 

Or maybe you don't like them. Then it's... shit, maybe I just don't like them because they're not my ""type"" so, I should consider them. Broaden my horizons. I like their flaws, I can do this. Then you end up leading them on. You never liked them. Wasted time. Maybe you soft ghost 'em, maybe you ghost 'em, maybe you just tell them and break their heart. \*(Edit based off replies- I shoulda included it anyway:) Maybe you're honest and they're fine with it- best option. I've got the other side of that though, I'm honest and they retaliate and keep trying thinking they can sway me. Or on the other side of the coin, they're honest with me and then change their mind, then it's a whole head fuck.\*

It's insanity. I just want to skip that whole annoying ""getting to know each other through texting because it's 2019"" and the whole ""balancing act"" and the whole wasting each other's time by not being up front... to that comfortable stage. I mean sure, I love the honeymoon stage too when you're fuckin' every day on the kitchen counter, the floor, the couch, sittin' on the same side of the booth when you eat Thai food and making everyone around you absolutely nauseous... But the comfortable stage... I wanna leave you little notes for when you wake up saying have a good day without it being weird, I wanna surprise you when you come home, completely naked, and not have it weird I snuck into your house. I wanna be able to cook together and when we digest a little bit we can still bang. I wanna not text all day and just talk to you when we're off work. I wanna give you a gift when I think of you, I wanna be able to vent to you and you to me without feeling like I'm dropping too much on you. I just wanna love you, man.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: Refer to title, and we should ban texting after you first meet for at least a month. Talk to each other in person or on the phone so shit don't get misconstrued and you ain't waitin' for a fucking response or not responding, whatever.",[deleted]

dating,llbi09,2021-02-16 19:28:52,I had an amazing first date with a guy I‚Äôve been crazy about for ages,"I‚Äôve been pursuing a guy who is absolutely lovely. I made the first move and I let him know exactly how I felt. I‚Äôll call him B.

We went to a big park in the city and overlooked the skyscrapers in the distance and watched the sunset go down. I was feeling a little shy so he made me feel comfortable by asking me about my pets and pointing to peoples dogs asking me what breeds they were. He knows I love animals so it was thoughtful of him as it made me feel comfortable and gave me an opportunity to show off my knowledge haha. It was a freezing cold day (colder than what we‚Äôre used to in this country) but it didn‚Äôt deter us. We walked down an icy hill back to the bottom and we held hands and laughed hysterically as we slowly walked down and almost slipped. 

He got a phone call from his business partner who was shouting at him as something messed up. B was stressed and told me that he needed to be at his laptop to fix the issue. I said we can call it a day as his business is very important but he said no and that he wanted to spend more time with me. It was beginning to get dark so we then walked across the city to go on the cable cars. We watched the city lights from above and he leaned in for a kiss. I dodged it at first as it was so cold our noses were running (gross) but he didn‚Äôt care so we just kissed anyway. Not that smooth but it felt right. 

We then went to another part of the city and got dinner and ate it on a cold bench. We spoke about life and as we like the same music, we were being silly taking it in turns to sing the songs that we like - finishing each other‚Äôs sentences. We only called it a night when we could no longer feel our hands or feet. We made fun in the freezing cold with with not much else. He said that he usually has a few drinks before going on a date, but this time he wanted to be sober with nothing clouding his mind. 

It was perfect and I‚Äôm so glad that I took the plunge and asked him out on a date. He said he‚Äôs not quite used to being praised and getting compliments and that he finds it flattering. We‚Äôve already planned a second date and speak every day, not necessarily all day but there is regular contact. We haven‚Äôt spoke about what we want but it‚Äôs pretty clear that the feeling is mutual so I guess we‚Äôll see how it goes.

SIDE NOTE: I think it‚Äôs a great idea to do simple things for the first few dates. Not only do you save money but the comfort of good food, drinks, atmosphere, music, and entertainment isn‚Äôt there. There are no additional things to make the experience seem better than what it is. Sometimes having fun is dependent on those factors, but if you take them all away then you rely only on the connection you have with the other person to have a good time. It‚Äôs a good initial test of potential suitability and compatibility.",Aww this is so sweet. It's the best when you can be silly together. Good luck to you guys!

We (me 24, him 25, 1st date)had a great time, he didn‚Äôt stop touching me briefly and ‚Äúaccidentally ‚Äú, intense eye contact. by the end of the date it was 6 hours since it started, we sat on a bench near the beach and he sat near me his whole body touching mine, he took my hand in his and held me‚Ä¶ it felt like as the date  passed he couldn‚Äôt keep himself away from me physically. 
It was after 3 a.m when we said goodbye, so‚Ä¶

We stopped near my house, he jumped out of his car, leaned on it, and when i stood in front of him to say thanks for the ice cream he pulled me, murmured something and kissed me so lightly on my lips twice holding me as if i would break, and i got so excited from all the sexual tension that i licked his lips, put my tongue just a little in his mouth and bit him lightly on his lower lip. 

I got so embarrassed and pulled away right away, i felt how surprised he was. 
then he looked at me kinda shocked and asked me what are my plans for next week, but I‚Äôm trying to think what he thinks about what i did‚Ä¶ was it good? Bad? Too eager? Hot?","Was the dude driving a semi truck?

dating,jx0e6f,2020-11-19 10:29:21,My worst first date ever,"I met a nice girl on an app, and we decided to meet up after talking for a couple days. We went for a walk in a fairly crowded park I picked. I picked this one because it has restrooms, and I had some stomach issues. I was there a week before, so I knew the bathrooms would be open. I brought some ""delicious"" drinks: kombucha (some kind of fermented drink) and cappucino with oat milk.

Pretty soon after getting to know her a little bit and drinking the fermented laxative and laxative with oat milk, I find myself running to the bathroom in the park, with her near, only to find out its closed due to covid... Even though they were open a week earlier. F**K!

I tell her: ""HEHE! I'm just gonna run to the restaurant over there"". As I run around the corner, I realize there is NO WAY I'm gonna make the restaurant. I end up jumping sideways into the bushes, and took care of business. 

I'm not sure if she noticed... I don't think so, I really hope so. After, I told her i wasnt feeling so well, took her to the train station, and didn't leave my house for a while lol.",Why would you drink those drinks when you were already having stomach issues?
dating,wtblk8,2022-08-20 16:44:43,I'm not going to stop approaching women in real life.,"I've seen a lot of posts/comments in this sub and others admonishing men for approaching women in real life. ""We don't want to be approached. Just leave us alone."" If I see a woman I'm attracted to, I'll take two minutes to introduce myself and say what's up. If she's not interested, I'll take the quick rejection and move on. Not a big deal at all.

Yes, there's obviously a way to do it. I'm not flirting with someone at the grocery store or the gym. I'm trying to buy my shit and get my sweat in too. But I can't see any reason not to say hello to a gal at the bar, coffee shop, or some other social setting.  And for the record, I don't expect any woman to reciprocate my interest. All I'm doing is expressing mine.","I can't speak for all women, but here's how I see it. If a man approaches me and is respectful I don't have a problem with it at all. I might not be interested, but I won't be rude about it. 

What I have a problem with is when men come up to me and say anything sexual, make comments about my body, touch me, demand I give him my attention, and keep on after I've said no. Also if I have to invent a bf or husband to get them to leave me alone it really pisses me off.

So as long as you are just saying hi, introducing yourself, complimenting her on her smile or outfit,  respecting her boundaries, and respecting her reaction I don't see a problem. Good luck out there!"

dating,nx30nr,2021-06-11 00:35:29,‚ÄúStop withholding sex if you want a relationship‚Äù is not advice that‚Äôs geared towards helping you find a long term relationship.,"This is often said by men who want sex easier and more frequently, regardless of whether they want to form a relationship with the woman or not. 

An important thing to remember is that there are men who will have sex with women that they don‚Äôt have relationship interest in. Whether the man doesn‚Äôt find her attractive enough, interesting enough, not enough in common, lack of chemistry, not smart enough, etc. Whatever the reason may be, bottom line is there are guys who will have sex with women regardless of these things. Some will ignore a woman‚Äôs desire for a relationship and still take the sex if she gives it to them. And that‚Äôs why this advice is self serving. It gives a woman hope that if she provides sex, it‚Äôll increase her chances for a relationship but it‚Äôs false hope if the man has already decided that he doesn‚Äôt see himself in a relationship with her. 

Both women and men hold off certain things such as money and sex in order to make sure the person they‚Äôre dating is actually interested in them and not what they provide. And there‚Äôs nothing wrong with this. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with making sure you and the person you‚Äôre seeing are like minded and have the same goal and that you aren‚Äôt being used. I‚Äôm sure both the men and women reading this can recall a time when someone clearly wanted sex or money from them and stopped contact once they realized it wouldn‚Äôt work. 

So, don‚Äôt let other people convince you to allow someone access to you earlier than you feel comfortable.

Edit: this is not gender specific. I want to add that this applies to men as well and their comfort with sex.","Case by case. Use your gut judgement people.

I‚Äôm especially talking someone who initiated/showed interest in you first, you liked them back, and they either lost interest or got with someone else (and lost interest after getting with that someone else).  Especially in cases of either almost dating or dating briefly.   And with the former especially, without properly dating at all, it‚Äôs painful because you go from clicking to almost being strangers.  There was a potential for a connection that didn‚Äôt come to fruition-even when you try staying friends you guys are now at ground zero since you only barely got to know each other.  You‚Äôre stuck with all these feelings to the point that it seems too good to be true that this person was interested in you a while back, despite them having to pursue you/even if they were quite keen on you back then.  Hearing stories of people who met the person they used to like and having those feelings resurface make you wonder if the one in your case will ever be interested again, but the fact that they changed their mind about dating you makes it doubtful.","Occasionally I‚Äôll think back on a connection I‚Äôve made that just didn‚Äôt pan out, but once it gets to the stage where I know they‚Äôve noped out or have stopped trying on their end, I accept it and forget it.

dating,hl3oss,2020-07-04 13:55:43,Girls ends it with me after I bring up concerns over her never offering to pay,"Did I dodge a bullet here?

I went on 3 dates with a girl who never once offered to pay for anything. I kind of gave her a pass on the first 2 since she drove 25 minutes ( I paid her to park since there is no street parking) to come see me and we always had a great time. I absolutely would not have let her pay but I still think she should have at least made an offer, but I was not too worried about it. On the third date, we went somewhere closer to her that she picked. We agreed on just drinks but shortly before the date, she told me she was hungry and she ended up ordering food while I ate dinner beforehand but got something small so she didn't feel weird.

We had a great time again but does not offer to contribute and then a few minutes later makes a comment about how I don't pay for her ubers to and from dates, while other guys she had gone out with did. She claims it was a joke but the timing was pretty poor so I was annoyed and the date ended pretty awkwardly shortly after.

The next day I let her know that I was pretty insulted by her comment because it's important to me that a girl offers to at least do something as little as pay for a round of drinks over the course of 3 dates, so to make a comment like that really hit a nerve. I told her I would not have even let her pay at this point, but the offer is a nice gesture that goes a long way with me and is very reassuring to me that I‚Äôm not being used as a meal ticket.

She then basically says ""I'm sorry you feel that way about me offering to buy a round of drinks but I don't really have much else to say"" and also makes a comment about this situation being immature and tells me that she'd like to end things. 

I'm pretty bummed because we connected really well and I was extremely attracted to her. But at the same time, I feel like I also dodged a bullet.",Problem solved itself.
dating,g2jlv5,2020-04-16 17:39:50,I miss innocence/youthfulness in dating/romance,"I don‚Äôt know if this is even the right place for this post, but I felt the need to get this off my chest. Im a 27 year old male, have only been in about 1.5 real relationships and a couple of young heartbreaks/unrequited love situations.

I found myself reading the initial messages between myself and the first girl i ‚Äúloved‚Äù when i was 18 years old. Classic case of became best friends, had way too many feelings, we couldn‚Äôt date for a variety of reasons (religions, family, etc). Eventually I couldn‚Äôt handle being just friends and it blew up.

But reading the messages just left me with a huge void for a couple of reasons. 1. The idealistic view I had of love and relationships at that age that has seemingly been destroyed by breakups and failures and heartbreak and aging. I understand that‚Äôs a part of growing up and it is normal to view romance and relationships different at 27 versus 18, but it leaves me with a bad feeling nonetheless. 2. I miss how innocent it was. How pure it was. There was no pretense or alternative interpreted meaning behind our conversations. There was no pressure.

Since that time, among other things, I have app dated a lot. Like >60 first dates a lot. And this has seemingly beaten down the aspects that made me so hopeful and joyful about love and relationships to begin with. It has become so formulaic, even when it is moderately successful. The dates are grossly similar, the conversations blur together. Always preparing to be ghosted at any given moment. Always prepared to throw copious amounts of money on a date with someone I may very well never see at again. And at its best, it just becomes this pattern of going on a few dates, before feeling pressured that its time for intimacy/physical intimacy or to decide if this relationship is going anywhere. 

I guess this is more of a way to write my feelings out then seeking any specific advice or guidance. I do wonder if any of you out there feel the same way and if so how you deal with it. How do you find ways to keep youthfulness and innocence in your dating life?","I enjoyed reading this. I feel this writers sadness over it as well. I think the pressure, expectation, experiences over time beat us down and our default mode when dating is to gaurd our hearts. We are so focused on protecting ourselves because of the fear we now have from our past experiences that it stops us from really being there in the moment and realizing this is nice and I‚Äôm happy. We don‚Äôt get as excited about things as much because we have had them before (first time holding hands and feeling this is the person I‚Äôm gonna be with forever), and we have seen feeling that way doesn‚Äôt mean it will last. In the last 2 years i have had a lot of first dates and some better than others but it takes a lot for me to get excited about someone now than it used to. The process takes a toll on you for sure."

I then messaged her saying ""Please respect sexual consent, I'm going to remove you from my contacts and permanently delete all the sexually explicit photos you sent me prior to the date, which, I never did ask for""

dating,hpi0zl,2020-07-11 21:22:26,How do people actually find their spouse/life partner?,"I look around at all of my friends and sisters and other family members who are married or in a LTR and sometimes get existential about how these couples actually found each other. 

After my (24F) few unsuccessful experiences in dating so far, it blows my mind how people actually find someone who wants to go on a first date together. 

And it goes so well that both people want to go on a second date. And a third date. And a fourth date. And they are both so equally into each other, that they become an official couple. And then they get to further know each other and build mutual trust and affection. And eventually they decide that they are so compatible that they want to spend their lives together. 

From my experience in dating, I sometimes get existential about how its even possible that anyone finds love and finds their person in a sea of people who are not into you, ghost, are emotionally unavailable, have mixed signals or string you along, then leave.

I definitely don't have any harsh feelings towards anyone who does find their life partner, if anything, it's very encouraging that it's possible. It's more just baffling to me that for some people, all of this dating stuff actually works out.","You basically realized it when you were baffled. Its a roll of the dice meeting someone, chatting them, then them chatting you back and after continued chatting, hanging out. If you wanna find a partner, you gotta talk to people.

dating,m7wo1x,2021-03-18 17:56:34,"If the majority of popular dating experts you watch are single, and are teaching you how to NOT be single... they probably shouldn't be taken too seriously.","I've been diving into online dating culture as a part of a research piece I'm doing, and have been struck by the amount of popular dating experts and life coach guru's who have messy personal lives but are eager to dish out a step by step process of how to find your person and settle down (with a price tag of course).

Kevin Samuels, Derrick Jaxn, Susan Winters, Mark Groves, Matthew Hussey, Corey Wayne... and a multitude of others. None of them are settled with someone, married, or in love... yet manage to dish out advice on how to find the person you are looking for. Sometimes the advice given directly to callers or email requests is brutally mean... other times its unrealistic and overly romantic... and most often its about game-playing. For example ""don't call her after the first date, girls like guys who aren't all in at the start"" or ""If he's not making a commitment, tell him THIS to make him stay"".

While them being single isn't a bad thing or a point of shame, in the context of offering people a method to settling down and finding love, it is similar to someone who is still a smoker trying to educate someone on the best way to quit smoking. Sure, maybe you have experience in the process of quitting... but if you have no consistent results to show for it, what makes your opinion worthy of my viewership, let alone an additional price tag?

This isn't to say they are bad people, but rather, to anyone who really trusts in the content that is put online by these (typically) unqualified 'experts', be wary. If these self-proclaimed role models haven't achieved the things you want in life and can't show you proof of how their methods work through the success in their own lives, take everything they say with a grain of salt... or maybe a tablespoon.

Don't sign up for their retreats, or programs, or invest your savings into a 2 week workshop to learn how to be a high value woman or man. Don't buy the online booklet of ""pre-written text messages to keep her interested"" or ""the foolproof method of how to keep him chasing"". Don't feel bad when you are told you have ""low market value"" by some jerk in a suit, or that you are the ""gatekeeper for sex/commitment"" or even that you are ""damaged goods"", ""pre-owned"" or on the opposite side of the spectrum ""a flawless king/queen who deserves anything in the world"".

None of this is good for you emotionally or mentally. Do not pay people for basic introspection.

The process of love will always remain a complicated and messy part of the human experience. There will never be a quick fix for anything, and it will remain a game of chance where the variables change from person to person based on their personalities, life experiences, expectations and life goals.

Embrace your own path...  listen less to people who are talking AT you through a webcam and if needed, sit down with a professional who can help you prepare for life's challenges in a safe and personalized environment.","Just to play devil's advocate. Most of the dating advice you get is going to be from single people. In your friend group asking the guy with a girlfriend usually ends up with the dumbest responses. ""we met on tinder and kinda hit it off."" Ask them how and they'll usually say ""idfk bro."" Ask the single homie and he's got way more shit to say that's at least slightly more useful.

Edit: I was just talking to a friend (whose in a relationship) about this and he said ""You just have to luck out bro."" ""keep meeting new people"" as if I haven't been trying any of this. 

This is the shit I'm talking about."

I went on a string of bad first dates until I thought I found ‚Äúmy one.‚Äù I‚Äôve never felt so connected to someone before and he seemed like a genuinely great person. He bailed after 6 dates and I was crushed. 

The experience made me realize how much I was settling before. I ignored red flags and took the advice that sparks don‚Äôt exist, so I should keep dating people who are interested in me and give them a chance, even if I wasn‚Äôt excited. 

I never, ever thought I would find someone else who made me feel the same way. Spoiler Alert: I did. He‚Äôs very similar to the other guy in many ways, but also very different. I didn‚Äôt change cities or drastically change my dating preferences, either. There‚Äôs too many people in this world for every single one of them to be completely unique.

If you feel like you ‚Äúlost‚Äù someone, you didn‚Äôt. Someone else is out there that will give you the same positive feelings. Hold onto your standards and boundaries.

EDIT FOR CLARIFICATION: I am not saying people are dispensable or we should tell grieving widows their spouses are replaceable. I am saying how it‚Äôs very easy to feel like you lost out on your chance at true love if someone you feel such a strong connection to leaves you. I truly believe that‚Äôs not true.

dating,ma66h1,2021-03-21 21:07:01,Advice for the people here under 25- you seriously don't understand how young you are,"I'm in my late 20s now and I have a good head on my shoulders. I have a career I love, I'm dating a beautiful woman and my family issues are finally starting to get sorted. Can I tell you where I was 6 years ago when I was 22? A complete fucking mess.

I had finished my bachelors degree and didn't know what to do with it so I was working odd jobs (despite having an expensive and high end B.Sc), I was missing an ex who wasn't interested anymore , I had a pretty bad porn and weed addiction and I was just confused. 

What I realize now looking back it, is that everything before the age of 25 is really just your exploratory and learning phase. Even though I had learned in cognitive psych that our brain isnt finished developing till we're 25, for some reason I expected myself to be at his best even though my brain wasn't finished developing! How does that make sense?

What I think you'll realize as you get older is that long term commitments truly are what make life meaningful. In career, in dating and even in friendship. Under 25 I had a huge clique of friends, most of which I don't talk to anymore. I was bitter about this a bit but now as time went on, the friendships that have stayed are truly so meaningful. The same goes with dating. When I was 24 I had only been with 6 partners to that point sexually, and I was feeling bad about it. It doesn't help that you have toxic pua  culture making guys feel like trash if they aren't obsessed with ""lay count"". So pathetic. What I realized is that one beautiful relationship is better than 100 one night stands. This also goes with career. Find something to commit yourself to, and give it your all. By ""find something"", I mean  follow your intuitions. They have a wisdom that your conscience brain isn't even aware of yet. The little stupid relationships I had have led me to the right partner. The stupid jobs I had led me to an amazing career. Weeding through all those superficial relationships allowed me to realize who truly was my best friend. 

So go ahead, make mistakes, let yourself feel shitty. Miss that person. Miss those friends. Long for a career that you can't seem to find. The only thing you should not do, is ever believe that you are ""lost"". You are not lost, you are simply finding exactly who it is you are becoming. And once your brain finishes developing, you will look back and realize how foolish you were for doubting yourself!

Edit- for the people over 26 who feel lost, the one peice of advice I can give you is this. Many many times when I was confused, when I just didn't get what the hell I was supposed to be doing on this earth and I was so mad at myself for being such a waste,  I told myself ""I don't know what I'm doing here. I don't know what I'm supposed to do. But what I do know, the one thing I know for sure, is that there's a part of me that wants to figure this out. There's a part of me that wants to enjoy this life. There's a part of that knows I have to keep going, to keep fighting. There's a part of me that knows this life is more than just suffering. I know it deep down that there's something miraculous about this life and I'm going to keep fighting to make this life mean something. That thought was all I had when I had nothing else, and its what you should hold onto. We all know this life isn't just misery, there's beauty to this story. Somehow, someway, you're going to find it. You know you will.","Man, for the first time in my life i cried like a child reading a reddit post. Im on my phone because i cant sleep. Im going to be 25 in a month and i feel so lost. I have a degree and a master degree in law, im a law trainee but i feel like its not what i want to do with my life. I feel like i wasted my life and i have nothing to show. I broke up with my 5 year ex-gf. Im back to my parents home, far away from my friends. My boss only talks shit about my work, even thought i was always a excelent student. Honestly i thought about ending it all. Im glad a friend called me on day and told me to seek help, so im on therapy. 

Anyway, this post helped me alot. Maybe is just a phase and i just need to keep fighting, but im so lost, confused, scared and depressed. 

I hope one day i can say the same as you. Wish the best buddy!"

dating,i9vqbd,2020-08-14 22:24:29,Don‚Äôt force yourself into liking someone,"One thing I have learned is that you should not continue going on dates with someone just because they have some of the good traits in your ‚Äúideal‚Äù partner and try to force it. 

This is a reoccuring issue where I will go on dates with someone because they have certain qualities that I like. But internally, I don‚Äôt romantically like them or am not attracted to them. I choose to ignore my feelings and more or less, force it just because I mentally think I SHOULD like him.

It's so important to really distinguish whether or not you like the person or do you like certain qualities about them. You shouldn't feel like you SHOULD like them. You should either like them or not. I really have to ask myself and self-reflect to determine this.

You can find those good traits in someone else and there's no need to be wasting both your own time and their time. Don't drag something on unless you truly like the person.

Don‚Äôt force yourself to like someone.","This. It happens alllll the time. And it's even worse when your family or friends are telling you ""you should like them, they have so much qualities/are so kind!"" Always listen to your guts, that's the only thing that matters.

So on valentinesday I was kinda talking about movies and stuff with her. I felt we really had a connection. 
So after work I jokingly asked if she wanted to go eat an icecream.

She went along and we got ourselves the same ice cream. We were walking home but split halfway. During the walk she kinda romantically fed me icecream and so did I to her. Since then we wait for each other and go grab an icecream. After a while I started to devellop feelings for her but never actually confessed.. 

Today we are working again together and after work, we ll go grab an icecream and then ill just confess.

dating,ly8iss,2021-03-05 09:47:24,"Does anyone else experience sexual and romantic attraction quite rarely, but when you do, it's very intense?","I'm nearly 23 and I've always been an ""all or nothing"" type of person when it comes to sexual or romantic attraction. With members of the opposite sex, it's seems that I either really like them and want to be with them, or I'm not interested in them whatsoever. NO in between. I also don't experience slow, growing attraction - for me, I will meet someone and suddenly it's ""omg, I really really like them and cannot stop thinking about them"". When I *do* find someone I like, the crush tends to last around a year or so. In that time, no one else interests me. For example, the idea of making out with a random person in a bar completely disgusts me. 

I've been in one relationship so it's not as if this is completely preventing me from getting in relationships, but it does make it harder. For example, dating apps don't really work for me. I find I'm more likely to feel interested in someone if we are in a situation where we are acquaintances or friends first, for example at work, at college or through friends. It feels ""safer"" that way for me, and there isn't that unspoken pressure that dating apps bring, where the person is interested in me and I'm feeling bad because I just can't get interested in them. 

I've been single for 3 years now and for the most part it's fine, but occasionally I worry about it. I do get members of the opposite sex showing interest in me, and I've tried to date people and give them a chance even if I'm not initially attracted to them, thinking that perhaps attraction will grow given time, but it never seems to work that way. I'm just wondering if anyone can relate to this, or if it's something I should worry about. Although, it feels inherent to me if that makes sense - not really something I can change.","Yes, I do too. I always felt that I was an odd one. I will go years without finding someone I find attractive or romantically interested in. But when I do find, I fall immediately for that person. That is why it is hard for me to get over someone, cause I know that it might even take years before I find something similar again. Some of my friends find someone every month, I envy those people.

dating,og418x,2021-07-08 09:52:05,Proud of myself for taking rejection like a boss but it still hurts a bit,"EDIT: Whoa I didn't expect this much support. Thanks for the comforting everyone!

 So this girl I met on Tinder... I was very attracted to her. After one date, I felt like the date went really well and I really wanted to see her again. The conversations felt very natural and she laughed at my stupid jokes and shit. She said she had never felt so at ease with a guy so quickly.

We spoke a lot through text afterwards too and I thought we were doing well. She told me a lot about her ex family-in-law who are being massive dicks to her even to this day and how her kids feel the effects of it.

Anyways, I asked for a second date and now she says she didn't really feel the ""click"" and the ""instant chemistry"" and that if we see each other again, it's not with the prospect to be in a relationship. She said that she found me a super cool guy and it's rare for her to find a guy she gets along with so well, that accepts that she has kids and with whom she can talk so relaxed to and literally told me ""it almost feels like I'm letting a chance pass with you because I went on another date and that was no relationship material either. He just didn't have your intellect and wit"" (her words)

She even invited me to her place to watch a movie alone with her at night while the kids are gone, but then she ended up cancelling this the next day because of said ""lack of chemistry"". 

She said that apart from a relationship, she would be happy to have an extra friend though.

I respectfully declined. I've been in the ""lets just be friends"" territory once in the past. No more. I swore I would never allow myself to go through that painful bullshit again.

This is what I answered by text (translated)

""I appreciate your directness and I'll be honest with you too. I'm not looking for just friendship and I won't pretend I'm fine with being just friends. If we're destined to be just friends, I prefer to decline because being friends with someone I'm attracted to is self-inflicted emotional torture I have no desire for. I think it's better we just break contact. I wish you a happy life""

I want to make it *absolutely* clear I didn't reject her friendship out of anger or hate. It's purely self-preservation. I don't wish to put myself through that self-inflicted pain so I pull the plug. And that's that. Furthermore I have enough friends already and have no need for new ones.

She replied she understands and that if she only encounters the wrong type of guys from now on, she'd keep my number for in case she seeks an honest, honourable man.

That last part kinda offends me. So basically, I'm her last option and I'm only good because others are scumbags? What am I a fucking Nice Guy? Is she honestly saying I'm just a backup guy she hangs on the coat rack so she can take me back when she needs me? Either way, not gonna stick around for this crap.

But the bottom line is: if you find yourself in the typical ""let's just be friends"" situation, think very carefully whether you're cool with that or if you're actually deluding yourself that she might change her mind. It's OK to reject being just friends. She doesn't owe you a relationship, you don't owe her friendship. She's not entitled to your friendship.

I could use some comforting words though... my confidence took a hit.","Don‚Äôt let her treat you like free salsa, you are guac, babyyyyy!"

If I hadn‚Äôt stepped up and just made a move I would probably have never had my first kiss yet. And I‚Äôve technically never had a boyfriend.

It‚Äôs just so weird to me, all around me it‚Äôs like people have all these options. Multiple men waiting to take them out, multiple men they‚Äôre seeing, and if they‚Äôre single it‚Äôs never for too long. It‚Äôs like men that value them in some way at least just fall out of the sky for a lot of women. I always have at LEAST a year gap between my last time talking to one guy, and a new guy even asking for my number. 

It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm ugly, or at least I hope not. I‚Äôve heard the complete opposite many of times and I don‚Äôt think I look too bad except in pictures. I am pretty aloof and dull sometimes but I do have a pretty okay personality and stuff. 

Idk what could be so bad about me that repulses men?","One contributor could be your social life/how much you put yourself out there. If you're around a lot of people, chances of at least someone finding you attractive increases. If you aren't super active socially, then you aren't exposing yourself to new people of which there may be one who likes you.

I'm a woman who went from having few options to being able to find someone relatively easily. Things that changed included: dressing better/putting more effort into my appearance, getting more fit (I was always thin, but I worked out to get muscle definition, etc), increasing my own confidence, going after the guys I want, being self-assured, becoming more social and becoming more extroverted, and even moving to a different location (from a suburb to a city)."
dating,grj8yr,2020-05-27 12:58:47,I hate dating because it's one aspect of my life I have no control over,"At least from a guys perspective, men in society are told early in their life that accomplishments make them desirable.

When you're young, it's easy to understand life trajectory that makes you desirable through accomplishments:

For me it was:

1. Do well in High School, so that you can...
2. Go to College, do well in college so that you can...
3. Get a job (or get a Masters--my path), so that you can
4. Get a better job in the city
5. ??????????????   \[This step is where I am right now\]

Now that I actually have an office job that I enjoy, now what? 

I know I want to meet someone, but it's not a straightforward path. There isn't like a list of steps for me to complete to guarantee that I will find someone. As someone that's driven by accomplishments that's the hardest thing about dating. You truly have no control over making someone like you--as we all know, being nice doesn't guarantee attraction.",Step 5 is start a fight club.
dating,rktfmx,2021-12-20 18:13:22,My boyfriend of less than a week told me that if I don't have sex with him we won't make it past a year,"I'm 27 and he's my first ever boyfriend. I've never been in a committed relationship before for many reasons, mostly because I've never really met quality people and they always end up hurting me. He's the first person I've ever felt such a strong connection with. He makes me happy and I can tell we need each other in our lives. He treats me well and we have such a good balance minus this one thing. We talked for two months prior to deciding to be with each other and he's reassured me over and over again that he won't ever pressure me to having sex but isn't this pressuring me to have sex? 

He knows I'm religious and that a huge part of me wants to wait until marriage. I've told him that I can do other intimate things but PIV sex is where I want to draw the line. I don't know what I'm doing and I feel so lost. I like him so so much and I want to make him happy but at the same time I feel like maybe I made a mistake. Maybe I shouldn't have entered this relationship despite feeling how I feel about him. I'm just so conflicted.","You're right. You were very clear with him where you stood on sex, and at the time maybe he thought he could live without it. It's possible he changed his mind, in which case, it's time for another conversation about if it makes sense to stay together. 

 This is what we call sexual compatibility and it's ok, it's no one's fault."
dating,hvd635,2020-07-21 18:44:46,Here is a little hope for some...,"Joined this reddit a while ago and been reading and relating with so many things posted and learning new points of views that I never considered sadly. Which really changed my reasons for wanting to be with someone and share my life with someone. 

I found someone and we have been talking and getting to know each other during this pandemic. So many times I questioned if I should even be pursuing romance at all during all this. But thankfully she listens and understands my concerns and we both got tested and are negative and decided to have a sleep over. 

Its awesome and we are a couple now. Maybe its too soon. Maybe its the quarantine talking. Either way I found the most caring and understanding and loving person. But only because I truly took in everything said here on both sides. I really love you guys here and really feel I was able to communicate and be understood was greatly due to the posts here.

So yeah even in all this chaos in the world. Everyone should still have hope that they will meet their match. Who knows if this lasts as long as it took for us to get to this point or longer but I know right now I feel really happy.",A lovely post to read! <3

I am currently seeing someone now and I‚Äôve alluded to it but not outright told them in detail what I went through.

dating,okeket,2021-07-14 21:51:01,‚ÄòTreat them good and they won‚Äôt value you‚Äô must be the the stupidest shit going around the internet rn,"No, be yourself. Don‚Äôt act like a dickhead for no reason. If you feel them then show it to them. But ALWAYS check them on the behaviour you don‚Äôt like. Trust your gut, you are right almost every time. If they ever even start acting shady or they don‚Äôt treat you good enough it‚Äôs on you to point it out and to stand your ground whenever you feel that you are right. They will either fix up, act oblivious or double down. Whatever the case may be, you can always pull back. You can leave. No point in trying to change someone that you are not compatible with. You are not responsible for it. Neither is it possible.
Your conscience should be clear. You didn‚Äôt force anything, you tried and it didn‚Äôt go your way. You became fed up with the relationship you two had. It can‚Äôt work with everyone.

dating,10jrn1w,2023-01-23 23:57:02,You Do Owe People Basic Human Decency,"I‚Äôve noticed a disappointing trend amongst people. I‚Äôve even had someone I liked say it to me recently. It‚Äôs the idea that we ‚Äúdon‚Äôt owe each other anything‚Äùand therefore it‚Äôs not a big deal to be cruel or dishonest. 

I fully agree that you don‚Äôt owe anyone a relationship, or sex, or your time. But you do owe people basic human decency! This means you owe them honesty and respect. (Unless of course this person seriously wronged you but that‚Äôs a different conversation). The dating scene gets me down because it just seems like everyone is out for themselves, it‚Äôs all about what you can get from others not much thought into what you can do for them. Not much consideration into how your actions may negatively affect someone else. 

I think people get hurt and turn bitter. They decide since they‚Äôve been hurt that somehow justifies them doing the same to someone else. But we‚Äôve all been hurt, we‚Äôve all been let down. That doesn‚Äôt excuse being unjustly cruel or cold to an innocent person. 

That‚Äôs all, thanks for coming to my TedTalk.","Yep I've always been saying this. A lot of people seem to lose basic decency as soon as they lose interest, then they do shit like ghosting etc."

After I made changes in my life, I started working out, picked up hobbies and forced myself to meet people.

I really liked this girl at work, and she told me that she doesn't mix work and personal life after I asked her out. What hurt me even more is that she told a few people, who went on to tell me ""she's out of your league"". Which is fair enough.

 I was ok and fine with it, until I found another a couple of months later that she's seeing a guy from our office. I probably have no right to be mad, but I was. I felt so frustrated and Hurt. 

And recently I've been meeting a few girls, who actually like being around me, and don't take it as a joke that I'm asking her out.

dating,f21nud,2020-02-11 02:36:08,10 Lessons Learned from Dating Over a Year (Male Perspective),"Hello all, decided to give the male perspective for dating and how to shift through toxicity as a heterosexual guy. (Niceguys, this may help you lol)

&#x200B;

**1.) Don't send millions of messages.** Please don't do this. Aside from looking desperate, when you send too many messages at one time, you actually race through the conversation. It makes it hard to stay on topic and ruins the flow of a conversation. It also makes it less likely she'll actually read everything you wrote.

**2.) Don't be afraid to send more than one message.** This is not a contradiction to **rule 1**. Basically, don't feel like there are strict dating rules you have to follow. If there is a topic you are really interested in and passionate about, don't be afraid to seem excited to talk about certain topics. God forbid you might actually show some personality instead of just looking like a ""cool guy"".

**3.) Don't waste your time with girls that give short replies or act like they don't wanna talk.** If a girl doesn't seem interested in the conversation, just stop. It takes two people to talk.

**4.) Don't let her act like she's cooler than you.** This one is worded a bit funny but all I mean is that don't let her behave like you're always the one that needs to impress her. Most girls actually have ZERO game. That's because it's usually guys that hit on them. This lets them sit back and act like they are above it all sometimes.

**5.) Don't be afraid of silences**. <-- This is something confident people easily pull off. If you're always talking on a date, trust me, the other person notices it. People who are afraid of moments of silence come across as insecure and often times they are. Slow your pace when you talk, give her time to answer questions and when she does answer, don't immediately jump in as soon as she's done. Give her time to elaborate and make her feel like the ownership of the conversation is also on her. This is a major power dynamic when first meeting someone. Similar to **rule 4**, don't feel like you always need to impress her. Let her impress you. (If you're super into the topic then don't be afraid to talk more but as a general rule, slow your pace down and put her in a position where she feels like she needs to speak.)

**6.) How does she behave? How does she treat you and others around her?** One of the best indicators of a person's character is how they treat people they don't care about or that can't do anything for them. If she's inconsiderate when you first meet, then she's inconsiderate. That's not going to get better. (Do not mistake ppl being uninterested with inconsideration. Inconsideration is when you two are dating or if you two know each other. Uninterested is when she ain't interested in dating you or when you're just a guy in her DMs. Both cases, you should walk away.)

**7.) Know what you're looking for.** Are you looking for a relationship or sex? We all have our own dating rules, so if you're looking for a relationship, pay attention to how she presents herself to the world and her boundaries. No offense ladies, but if a girl gets sexual with me immediately, that's a strike against her as far as a relationship goes. I've had girls send me nudes within 20 minutes of talking.  If she gets sexual with you right off the bat, you need to decide whether that information would cause problems later on if you decided to date her. This is where **rule** **6** comes into play. If she's really a great person then lots of guys will still consider her gf material.

**8.) Don't put her on a pedestal.** Similar to **rule 4**. It's called a partner, not a boss. If you're always sucking up to her or telling her how amazing she is and how beautiful she is, she won't like you. Flip the tables, what if you had a guy friend always telling you how cool you are and how unworthy he is to be your friend? You'd probably be like yeahhhhh he's a nice guy but he's a suck up. We want people who view themselves as our equals to be our friends. It's the same with relationships. We want people who view themselves as our equals to be our partners. No one likes a suck up.

**9.) Don't pretend to be something you're not.** It's hard to be yourself with someone you've just met. But it's much easier to avoid pretending to be something you're not. If you like video games or if you hate clubbing (like me), don't be scared that you'll look nerdy. I've had girls who had pictures of them clubbing tell me that they actually didn't really like it that much and they only did it cause there was nothing else to do sometimes. Don't try and look cool by lying about your interests.

**10.) Be a decent human being.** There is a big difference between being nice and being kind. Try and be both if you can but if you are nice to someone don't only be nice hoping to get something out of it. Regardless of what happens, relationships, friendships, strangers, etc, the effort of being a good person even when it's hard is a reward in and of itself. If you let yourself get nasty too many times then eventually you'll just be a nasty person. Actions become habits and habits become part of who you are.

&#x200B;

**Bonus Rule:** I've seen on niceguy videos where they will narrate themselves during texts. Yeah...don't do that.

I have a tendency to elaborate so probably made this longer than necessary but because it's Reddit, I figured the less misunderstandings the better.",I like that this point of view is positive.  Not bashing women.

dating,s6f88s,2022-01-17 21:20:48,Confessions of a real-life 40-year-old virgin,"I recently had sex for the first time at the age of 41.

God, isn‚Äôt that a crazy sentence? I mean, I‚Äôm literally a Hollywood punchline! I certainly never expected my love life to turn out as it has. As a teen and young adult, I dreamed of meeting Mr. Right and having a family and all that jazz, same as most women. But my life just unfolded differently.

No, I‚Äôm not a religious zealot or a mental case. I have a master‚Äôs degree and a good job and a pretty normal life. I‚Äôm no supermodel but I‚Äôm at least average-attractive. And my friends would describe me as sweet, caring and good-natured. But I‚Äôm also very introverted; it‚Äôs never been easy for me to socialize and meet people, and I have few really close friends. And on top of that, I have a gifted-level IQ, some quirks due to having ADD, and a deep passion for all things nature. Not exactly a conventional package ‚Äì and it has not been easy to find someone who could truly understand and appreciate all of that! I‚Äôve dated a few guys over the years, but the relationships have always been casual and short-lived. There have been times when I was profoundly lonely, doubting my own worth, and wondered if I ever would find love.

It took me 20+ years of my adult life, a nature-related FB group, and a chance real-world meeting with a fellow member to finally do so. Amazingly, my lover felt a connection with me -- with my intelligence and passion and kindness in my interactions with others in the group -- before we ever met! He even tried to get my attention, in some small ways, but I was oblivious (something we joke about now). But after that chance meeting, we began conversing on Messenger, and I felt the same strong spark of connection almost immediately. The relationship blossomed rapidly from there.

He is the first person I truly WANTED to have sex with, the first person I had felt that level of attraction, connection, trust and comfort with. As we grew closer, and it was clear we both wanted intimacy, I told him the truth about my inexperience. I knew I couldn't fake that in the bedroom, and he deserved to know.  

After a moment of surprised silence, he looked at me with something like awe, and thanked me. He said that my honesty and trust were the real gift to him, and he was blown away by it. (For the record, that's pretty much exactly the reaction I had expected from him. It's how a good person who truly respects you SHOULD react to such an admission, if you ask me.) 

We made love for the first time a few days later, on New Year‚Äôs Eve. I never felt awkward or uncomfortable even for an instant, and it was one of the best nights of my life.

I wanted to write this for a couple of reasons. One, I wanted to remind people that it‚Äôs okay to be single longer than normal, okay to wait until you‚Äôre truly sure. No one‚Äôs relationship path is the same; there is no right formula or set timeline. When the right person comes along, and when you are truly ready, you‚Äôll know. Don‚Äôt let anyone or anything pressure you; that can only lead to regrets.

Two, this is for the folks like me ‚Äì the folks who are different in some way, who haven‚Äôt had much luck with relationships, who are struggling with loneliness and doubts and insecurities. Don‚Äôt give up! Live your life, find outlets for your passions (you just might meet someone that way), and trust that the right person will come along sooner or later. The truly precious things in life, like love, are precious because of their rarity, and they are worth waiting for.",[deleted]

dating,kmpmfb,2020-12-29 23:24:59,Dating and relationship advice subs are creating more problems than they are solving and keeping people out of successful relationships,"Apparently, this is not a r/unpopularopinion, so let me try my hand posting here: 

I have lurked on dating or relationship advice subreddits (and admittedly will leave comments or give my own advice when the mood strikes me) both as someone in a relationship and a single person and as entertainment, they are wonderful. However the longer I have been scrolling these feeds, the more I see people frustrated to the point of madness because the ""quick fix"" solutions or ""pro tips"" they are offered on these subs aren't working for them. The problem is not that they are getting inherently ""bad"" advice, it's that the actual problems are not being addressed! There is no way that you can be an ""expert"" on relationships if the relationship is between you and another unique individual; both with their own histories, baggage, stressors, emotions, etc. Just as no two people are alike, neither are any two relationships and what might work for one relationship may not work with any of your current or future relationships. Likewise, there is not a ""right"" and a ""wrong"" way of doing things or even being in a relationship, for that matter. The level of overthinking and overanalyzing every single action or word that is said between two people to look for ""red flags"" or some type of ulterior motive is a complete waste of time. There is no way to know anyone's true motives and continuing to spout out opinions or your own past experiences as fact only further alienates the advice seekers from any potential partners and creates an echo chamber for people to continue to hear only what they want to hear.

The fact of the matter is that it takes two (or more) people working together over time and through changing circumstances for a relationship to be successful. By making all men/all women the enemy, using behavior patterns to solidify your own dating stereotypes, and/or taking out shit that people have done to you in the past on people you just meet, you are perpetuating your own aloneness. Coming on the forums to get everyone to side with you doesn't help you get a better perspective, it only perpetuates your own problematic behavior. Likewise, listening to the completely biased recommendations of strangers about your personal relationships is baseless. You will be the one left with the consequences of what you decide to do in your relationship, why are you putting this in the hands of strangers who will never be impacted by your choices?

The best advice I have seen on these subs is to encourage people who really want to learn about how their own behavior and past experiences affect their current relationships to seek professional help. The reason why people (rightfully) encourage others to go to a therapist, is because their job is to take an objective view and help you work through your issues without ever giving you advice! Advice is subjective and has more to do with the giver than the receiver. Also please stop trying to diagnose yourself or others with disorders or ""attachment problems"" when people don't do what you want them to. People go to school for many years and pay exorbitant amounts of money to get degrees, certifications, and licenses to take on the burden of correctly diagnosing people with mental health disorders. We don't need people taking what their own therapists have told them out of context or something they researched through third parties online to further confuse people who really do need help working on more problematic issues.",I'm just here to learn the warning signs and collect data
dating,12kb3we,2023-04-13 03:59:51,I feel so embarrassed and think I just killed the relationship? [NSFW],"This girl (24F) and I (27M) have been going on dates for about a month. Things have been proceeding well; there's been chemistry and good times throughout. 

Last weekend she came over and we ended up making out towards the end of the night. No sex or playing around or anything, just making out. She stayed the night and hung out with me until about noon or so the next day. It was really, really nice. I really felt like we connected on a much deeper emotional level and that we both had a wonderful time. We've been flirting and sending hearts back and forth pretty heavily since then. The feeling felt mutual.

Cut to today. I offered to make her dinner this evening and she accepted and came over. The food ended up pretty terrible honestly but we had a good laugh about it and things progressed regardless. Things seemed kinda off right away though because she kept checking her phone -- like **a lot.** I don't really pay much attention to stuff like that but it seemed kind of obsessive. 

We ate and moved to the couch where we talked for a bit. Before long we started making out and eventually it evolved into sex in my bedroom. She was wearing some lingerie under her clothes and confessed to changing into it before she came over, which tells me she intended to have sex or at least fool around.

Some context. This was the first time I'd been with someone in nearly two years and she knew that. We talked about it and she told me to not feel bad if I came quickly, which I did. I asked her if I could help her finish and she said ""maybe later"" and told me to be quiet and come cuddle but then she wouldn't cuddle? She kind of just pulled up the blanket and made no effort to move towards me.

After like two minutes of this she abruptly got out of bed and started getting dressed. She told me ""usually the guys are the ones who leave quickly, but I'm doing it"" or something like that which seemed really weird. She quickly moved through my apartment, gathering all of her things without really saying anything.

I kind of jokingly asked her ""If this were an Uber ride, how would you rate it?"" And she responded by telling me not to ask that question because the answer was never fun. She told me she had a good time and that she found me very attractive, then left. She was gone within like five minutes of us having sex. She is a busy person so I get not wanting to linger or whatever, but I was really hoping we'd be able to connect afterwards and she didn't seem to want any of it.

I dunno. I'm just very confused by the entire situation. I feel embarrassed for coming so quick and for not being able to help her finish. I feel like I disappointed her or did something wrong. Just needed to vent.

EDIT: Thanks for the support and feedback everyone. It's much appreciated. I have seen a few comments about getting her off first and I feel I should clarify the play-by-play a bit more. Before things got real hot and heavy, she told me she wasn't really into cunnilingus. She gave me head when we got going for a bit and I followed by fingering. My plan was to get her off first because I knew I wouldn't be able to last very long but she told me she wanted me inside her after only a minute or so of fingering. So I obliged and held on for as long as I could.

UPDATE: She ghosted me.","In future, if you know you‚Äôre going to cum quickly, make her cum first, before you have sex. I don‚Äôt know why, but I‚Äôve definitely seen women not be as into oral, manual after sex."
dating,11mlgrp,2023-03-09 06:59:08,Why do some girls say they hate hookups and are tired of them yet continue to do it?,"I‚Äôm a guy and I don‚Äôt hook up.  I‚Äôve turned down probably 10-15 people for it because it‚Äôs not what my values lie with.  I always wait to have sex with people until at least a few dates in so the person I‚Äôm dating is comfortable and will enjoy it.  This actually has proven to work really well for me and results in probably 80-90% of the people I meet to want to want to continue going out.

However I found from a several of the girls I date that they‚Äôre so tired of hookups and being used for sex.  Which 100% makes sense and I totally get that because I hate hookups too.  Yet some of these women just keep hooking up and are miserable from it.  I‚Äôve kept in touch with most of the women I stop dating because we usually end things on good terms.  Several of them have told me that they‚Äôre so tired of all the hookups most guys seem to try for and they just do it with them anyways.  

So basically I‚Äôm just confused why.  I know plenty of girls who value intimacy and have said no to plenty of hookups yet I‚Äôve met others who just keep doing it even though they despise it.",Because every single time they think it'll go somewhere with that guy but they get dumped and it feels miserable later on. So they are tired of it but the cycle continues.
dating,s4eovr,2022-01-15 07:16:22,Did I love bomb this girl?,"Me (25M) and this girl (26F) went on 3 dates. On the second date we had sex (initiated by her). In between the second and third date, she let me know she passed out and ended up in the hospital. I sent her some flowers saying ‚ÄúHope you feel better soon‚Äù.

When she received the flowers she said she really loved them and they were nice. When she ask why I gave them to her I said ‚Äúseems like you have had a rough few days and thought it would be nice‚Äù. I never mentioned the flowers again in any future conversations because I honestly didn‚Äôt expect anything in return. 

We went on our third date and it seemed to go well, well I thought it did. Unfortunately, she ghosted for a little over a week after the date. I initiated the conversation again because I left my watch at her place after our second date asking if I could get it back. During this conversation she broke it off with me saying she ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt feel a connection‚Äù and that the flowers made her feel ‚Äúvery pressured‚Äù because we only been out a couple of times. 

Making her feel ‚Äúpressured‚Äù made me feel horrible. When I went and picked up my watch I apologised for making her feel pressured, that wasn‚Äôt my intention and wished her all the best for the future. 

Did I love bomb this girl by giving her flowers after 2 dates? I thought given the context of the situation of her ending up in hospital it would be appropriate, because if that didn‚Äôt happen there is no chance I would get her flowers this early into knowing her.","She was in the hospital, sending her flowers is very normal behavior."
dating,q73jdl,2021-10-13 04:30:03,Does any other guy feel replaceable in dating,"I feel like I have no value. Every girl I see has an army of guys waiting in the wings and I have to compete with them while she can just show up and do whatever and I‚Äôll still be trying to get her to think I‚Äôm better than the other guys she could be talking to.

If she has social media or Tinder, it‚Äôs likely I‚Äôm competing with every guy on campus. Every single guy in the city. Probably even guys outside of the state. 

It takes so much asking and rejection to get one girl to agree on a date with me. I‚Äôm not some good looking 6‚Äô2 hot guy so I know it‚Äôs be nearly impossible to find more than one woman willing to give me a slight chance. If I mess up even slightly she‚Äôll just move up one of the 9 other guys she‚Äôs texting. I have no value to anyone I try to date.

Is this just what it is to be a guy? Is dating always like this?","I mean, on the one hand, nearly all of my exes are able to find someone else within a week or two of breaking up with me, because they are attractive women. So, in a sense, they can and do replace me pretty quickly as a partner, yes. And match rates from online dating suggest that I'm physically pretty ugly, I guess, so I can't do the same. (Though, in a funny sort of way, all of my exes assume that it'll be easy for me and incredibly difficult for them, because they are in pretty strong denial of how online dating works.)

On the other hand, for all my failings, there's a lot that's awesome and beautiful about me and that can't really be replaced. They just find something different.

For some people online dating does create a greener pastures scenario, where there always seems to be someone more appealing just a few swipes away and it can crush people's sense of value and self worth in this way, and especially for those who largely go ignored and alone on there."
dating,jizxkp,2020-10-27 12:11:10,Being a child of divorce really screws up my perspective on dating and marriage.,"I'm always afraid that I'll never be enough for whatever girl I date, that she could never accept my flaws, that she could never truly love me. My dad flat-out told my mom one day that he didn't love her anymore, and 13 years later I still can't forgive him for it. So when I find girl that deep down I want to date, I second-guess myself. I don't want to have any of this looming over me anymore.","I can give you the other side of that coin, and perhaps that can balance your perspective.

My parents really screwed my perspective on marriage, but because they stayed together. They fight constantly on everything, including how one person pronounces a word compared to the other person, when both of them are wrong. I learned that relationships are miserable, that there is no way to talk to someone unless you're fighting, that love isn't a thing except in movies and books and that marriage is a life in prison sentence. I've told them many  times, I wished they divorced so they could have taught me what it was like to follow your happiness, to make it yourself, rather than make the other person miserable because you're miserable.

What I've learned as an adult...people evolve,  you're not growing and challenging yourself if you're not. Our brains are still developing until we are 25. Our experiences shape who we are, what we believe in, our morals, etc. For most people, they get married too young, and when I say too young, I mean in their 20s. They  just got out of their parents' house. Everything they know is shaped by their family and small town/neighborhood they live in. They haven't had the opportunity to travel the world, to experience new cultures, to meet different types of people, etc. That's why going away for university that has diversity is such an enriching environment. But that's just a start to open one's eyes.

So as you get older, you change. If you married in your 20s, you're also dating someone that is comfortable and possibly compatible to your 20s self. But as you both add more experiences, you will start 'shedding' what was taught to you by your elders and start forming your own beliefs and morals. You are two individuals and it would not be uncommon or unusual for your experiences to shape you differently so now your 30s version or your 50s version of your individual selves may no longer be compatible. So why  hold each other back from pursuing your new dreams and happiness?  That's not to say that people stop loving each other, but sometimes people feel as if they have to choose between someone else's happiness and their own, and that is almost like forcing a square peg in a round hole.

Most people do not have the same friends when they are 80 compared to when they were 20. Why? For the same reason, all those individuals evolve. It's also different staying in touch with each other and deciding to do a mutual activity that you both enjoy together like golf. It's another to feel as if you have to like all the same things and have the same beliefs and views on life, which is also why marriage is a lot more complicated as people evolve. Of course, as with anything, it's about doing things in a healthy and loving, and not toxic and hateful, way. By  the time, most people divorce, they can't stand each other because they pushed it too far. But loving people who divorce in a healthy way also reflect loving co-parenting and extended families."
dating,w5udap,2022-07-23 04:06:23,I am outraged by men asking me to come over for a first or second date to their home and have them cook me dinner.,The men on dating apps in America frequently suggest this. I come from an Eastern European country and to have a man want to cook you dinner just makes me laugh. Obviously it‚Äôs different if you are in a relationship and switch things up to where he cooks for you. But a first or second date?? Also it‚Äôs obvious they want to hook up as well from this. Just the audacity for them to ask makes me scream!!!,"I mean, I enjoy a nice meal. I'll cook or he can cook its all cool, food is a love language afterall. I'd only be worried if that happened later on in fear one person is relying too much on the other for food, makes the other upset.

BUUUUT Its definitely not a good idea to visit the guy's home first or second date (if that's what you're referring to) we women really need to watch out for ourselves. So yeah a restaurant date is preferred over a home cooked one absolutely."
dating,psm75b,2021-09-21 16:23:22,Is it impossible to get intimacy from men?,"Sex is not a problem... In my experience they practically throw it at me. I haven't been hugged, snuggled, or kissed passionately in two years. I just want someone to make love to me and kiss me with passion and play with my hair. They don't even want to spend the night after sex they all leave like I'm a call girl or ask me to leave because they are ""tired"". Why is that so bad to want intimacy? I know I deserve it. Dating seems easy but all they want is sex usually even when I make it clear that's not what I'm after. I'm emotionally drained and lonely. I feel so alone even though I'm secure and confident in myself. I just want someone I can be affectionate toward and they reciprocate. Why is that so hard? I don't give into sex right away until I feel a connection, but this still keeps happening. I'm tired.",It‚Äôs definitely out there! Trust me!!

My birthday is Valentine‚Äôs Day and it‚Äôs definitely a Hallmark holiday that‚Äôs way overplayed IMO.  However, it‚Äôs still a nice day to spend with someone special, and in a way, I wish I had that too.  

I have my family that I‚Äôll be spending time with and friends maybe later that day, but to have the special someone to wish you a happy birthday, give good ‚Äúbirthday sex‚Äù and to just be around to enjoy their company would be extra on top of that.

It‚Äôs bizarre that anywhere I go I constantly see guys with girlfriends/wives & a lot of the time these women are attractive. But it just seems like no one even bothers to talk to one another anymore unless they know them already. Online dating is a huge disaster unless you have an amazing job or top tier looks. So what is it that women are even looking for these days? Why is it so difficult yet I always constantly see people together. It‚Äôs like I feel like I‚Äôm in some sort of Matrix or something where things are just meant to happen for others when I‚Äôm not around. Yet I never ever see anyone get asked out in person or anything. If it‚Äôs so difficult how do so many people find it so easy? I‚Äôve heard of people getting out of relationships than finding another in like 3 weeks time. I just don‚Äôt get it at all.,"I've been wondering the same thing for about a year and a half now. I tried online dating too, and that was just a joke. I've just stopped trying at this point, and am focusing on myself. Saving money, fixing up my vehicle, etc. Best of luck to you though."
dating,grzco2,2020-05-28 04:22:46,Went on my first date in a year and he fell asleep before our date. I told him to forget it.,"Put myself back out there, after a whole year since my last relationship ended. I finally landed a guy I thought may be worth my time and then get stood up. I was excited, I shaved everything, I did my hair and makeup and found a cute outfit. All for a loser like my ex. My ex had me wait 2 hours for him our first dat, said he'd be there in 20 and 20 turned into 2 hours!! I shouldve left. I didn't and relationship failed in the end. From the beginning he didn't give a damn. So thats why I didn't give this guy a 2nd chance. First impressions mean everything for sure. I don't need another version of my ex. He sounded so unapologetic on the phone when I called to see where he was. Didnt say sorry until i told him to forget it. It hurts, im embarrassed, and i cried, but I'm glad he showed his true colors on day one. I'm waving the litte white flag on dating. I deleted the apps. What was i thinking!? Trash is everywhere. I know you have to go through a few bad ones to get to the good. But I dont have any motivation to continue to get my heart played with. I enjoy not shaving and not wasting my time. So I'm done..until next time.

EDIT: for those that want the details this is how everything went. He asked me if he could come over yesterday,  I said let's meet in public first, he arranged date for that night at a sushi place, we agreed to talk soon, I text im on my way, get no response,  so keep driving hoping he just wasn't responding because he was driving too, i get there, text him ive arrived, wait another 10 mins, so I call him. Then he answers and says he fell asleep and he ""knew this would happen"" when he fell asleep at 4:30 (date was at 6:30) I go okay maybe we can reschedule or maybe we should forget it, but thats when he started to say what time is it? ""Oh its 6:46, what time did we say we were gonna meet?"" (After HE planned it for 6:30) I then said I'm already here and he goes ""no youre not! You did not drive there"" and im like yes i did, I drove all this way! He goes ""Oh man you can hang up on me now i know you're probably mad"" so I tell him to forget it. That's when he says I'm sorry I was a sleepy boy and I say okay bye. And hang up. He then snapchats me saying sorry again for being a sleepy boy. Kinda wierd but I accepted the apology and told him good luck with the next one. The end haha.",Hey it gets better. I promise. Keep trying. Just make sure you are ready. And healed.

dating,lgts3d,2021-02-10 13:37:36,"Funny Story: My cringe bios on dating apps like OkCupid, Tinder, etc. led to finding my significant other. It started off as a rant to one another on Whisper, which led to talking more, and her saying ""I can help with your dating bios. You seem chill."" Before I knew it, we were dating and in love.","Background: So I \[M.25\] have NEVER had much luck with online dating over the year, I started online dating back in like 2012 on an online multiplayer game called Ourworld (RIP. Adobe Flash)! We dated long-distance online (or so I thought) for almost a year. After breaking up, I was stupid nervous about meeting people in real life so I thought, I'll try going on online dating apps.   


So between 2013-2019, I was off and on all the major dating apps. I was on Tinder, Bumble, OkCupid, PlentyOfFish, and even ChristianMingle (after my old-fashioned parents recommended it.) I'd get maybe 1/50+ matches. Bumble was always dead ends and nobody ever said ""Hi"" or ""You seem chill."" And the few times I did get a response, while I built some amazing friendships with some, they normally went down the tubes because of either distance or life getting in the way. A few times, I tried to go on dates in person and it just turned into ""I'm too tired. Can we get a raincheck?"" It was quite annoying to say the least. I thought I was ugly or something?   


Well then, one day in October of 2019, I was on Whisper and my soon-to-be SO had made a post about how she was lonely and new to where I live. I'm a fairly social person, so I messaged her ""Hey, welcome! I've lived here my whole life. If you'd like a tour of the area, maybe I can show you around?"" She started crying and our conversation turned into this cheesy pick-up line war of stupidity. By the end of the evening, I was up until 2am talking to this random stranger. Next thing I knew, we were talking as Facebook friends and I found out she was single. She had just gone through a really bad relationship and wasn't looking. I was like ""Okay, well, I guess we can be friends? I'm single too. I just can't seem to get any dates."" She's like ""Well, maybe I can help you with that?"" She took note of what apps I used and then two months after us meeting I got ballsy enough and said ""Hey, wanna go out or somethin' this weekend? We haven't met and I'd love some help on the dating scene.""   


She accepted my offer and at first I wasn't sure what to think about it? I felt like a little kid when she said ""yes"" but I was so nervous she wouldn't like me. I wasn't very confident to say the least. Anyway, so we meet up for the first time, I've never even met up with a girl before. I didn't really know what to expect but I decided ""I'll just give it a whirl and try."" I pull up to her house and pick her up. It's a little awkward at first after getting her inside my car. Conversation started off with the nervous ""Hi"" and then it turned into talking non-stop for the next hour or two over a game of Uno at the local park. After I dropped her off, I was thinking in my head ""Well, that was different but we'll be great friends.""   


Yeah, well, that didn't last very long. It wasn't but a few days later, I was cooking in my kitchen watching the Toronto Maple Leafs playing hockey and making poutine that I knew she was the girl I wanted to be with. It was your typical conversation of ""What ya doin'?"" And no sooner had I said ""Making poutine"" she was like ""I love Poutine! I used to make it for my dad and I haven't had it in so long!!!! Nobody likes it really here."" That's when I took the opportunity and said ""Well hey, why don't we get together again and go back out. Let's go eat Poutine!"" ""Sure! Sounds fun?"" ""I'll pick you up at 10am and we can head out on Saturday."" It wasn't a date. It was just us hanging out.  


This time, we were past the ""awkward"" hellos and went straight to being comfortable around one another. We went to a little poutinerie in Houston. We talked and talked and talked and talked on the drive up there (about an hour in drive time.) When we got there, I asked her ""Hey, so what about these dating apps? You said you'd help me, would you? Maybe we can do that while we're here?"" We sit down at our table, I handed her my phone, and she started going through my profiles. ""I'd do this and this."" And I don't know if it was something in my profiles or what, but she just stopped, looked at me, and smiled this cute awkward smile. I was like ""Everything okay?"" ""Yeah, I'm fine."" She made some edits, handed my phone back, and said ""Here, try again."" I took my phone back and we just kept spending more time together. We talked about life, school, food, horror movies, and so much more. When we left, we went to a book store and board-game caf√©. But it was during all of that time, I started realizing I was catching heavy feelings for her.   


A few days passed by and she asked me how it was going on the dating apps. I didn't have a response really but I shrugged it off and avoided the question. Then I asked if she'd want to hang out again soon? ""Sure. I had a lot of fun last weekend."" I planned a day out on the town and we made plans yet again but this time, it was going to be different. I had had a really rough week at work and there was a lot of personal stuff that had happened that week that had me pretty depressed. I figured that getting out and such would help. Well, after I picked her up, we went for a drive along the beach and we found a spot where we could be alone and just watch the waves. We started talking about our futures and dreams. (We wanted most of the same things.) That's when I looked at her and I said the stupidest, craziest, boldest thing ever, ""Will you be my girlfriend?"" And with her sparkling amber eyes in the moonlight, she said ""Yes"" and kissed me. I was so excited and in shock, I started crying. She had said ""Yes"" and I was lowkey expecting rejection, but she said ""YES!"" What I didn't realize at the time was what our relationship would turn into much later on...  


Now, this young woman is about to become my bride in March. Fifteen months later, we're getting married and I could not be happier! I don't know if it was something she read on my cringe worth dating profiles or if it was something else but I am so happy she decided to say ""Yes."" Who knew that the most important match would come from a bland dating profile? I am the happiest man I've been in years now!",Cutest shit ive ever read

dating,rjxcp7,2021-12-19 14:02:23,When you‚Äôre in a committed relationship. What is your honest opinion on pornography? Either watching it together or alone.,"I‚Äôve dated three types of girls.  Ones who hate and don‚Äôt like their boyfriends watching it.  The ones that will watch with me but that‚Äôs the only time it‚Äôs acceptable.  And finally the ones that will watch it with me, and don‚Äôt care that I watch it alone to get off.  Currently right now I‚Äôm dating the third type of girl.  Let me start out by saying I think my gf is the hottest woman in the world.  Due to our careers, 2+ hour distance, and other factors we don‚Äôt get to see each other as often as we‚Äôd like.  She knows I watch porn and I know she does too.  Our sex life is absolutely amazing, and even if I watch porn I have to finish by thinking of her.  It‚Äôs one of the most healthiest relationships I‚Äôve been in regarding communication, and understanding of one another.  What are peoples thoughts. I don‚Äôt watch porn to imagine banging another woman.  It‚Äôs a stimulant for me to take care of some sexual frustration that has built up from not having the real thing.

EDIT: I cannot thank you guys enough for all your opinions on this.  Never thought this question would get so much attention.  Your responses have been great, over 500 comments.","There's a 4th kind of girl, like me. I watch and I don't care if he watches, but I will not watch together.

dating,thd1j0,2022-03-18 19:28:22,I was told that having no social media is a MAJOR red flag.,"I matched with a woman from OLD, and we hit it off really well. When we talked about meeting up, I set up a place and time that would work with our schedules and she agreed, I sent her my number, and said she could call or text when she got there. She then said to add her on Snapchat first. I told her that I didn't have any social media, and she responded with ""I'd prefer if you did, it's 2022."" I explained to her that I decided to take a break from social media in 2018 after an 8 year relationship because it wasn't helping me move on and when I found that I felt a lot better without it I just didn't want to have it again. She then responded and said that no social media is a major red flag and that every guy she's dated that didn't have social media had something to hide and also referenced a movie (Steve Kemp) and apparently that fictional character is a psycho with no social media. 
So is it really a MAJOR red flag to not have any social media now days? Because I really don't want to do it just to be able to date. 

Tldr: woman I matched with from OLD said no social media is a major red flag.

Edit: I understand reddit is technically a social media platform, but I don't use it in the way traditional social media is used. I follow subs related to most of my hobbies and my dog for ideas and advice. I only recently downloaded it late last year because almost every time I was looking for advice or ideas, Google would direct me to a reddit forum anyway.",I think the mindset that you HAVE to have social media is a bigger red flag.

dating,p4qs9c,2021-08-15 10:05:49,"Improving yourself doesn't guarantee you won't get rejected and you shouldn't continuously ""improve"" yourself in order to date people","I am so tired of this. I understand a lot of people don't work on themselves and that may be a reason they get rejected. But whenever someone posts anything online about rejection or literally anything wrong in their dating life they get the advice to improve themselves even though nobody actually knows the person who posted and if they actually need to improve something. If you are someone who is actually working on themselves and you have been doing it for years you don't want to hear that because it's like basically saying ""you are never good enough"".

Firstly, everything is subjective when it comes to dating, including improvement. If you change your hairstyle you could see it as improvement and lots of people may love it, but for a lot of people that will be a turn off. The same thing applies to every other thing about yourself. So, you can never be liked be everyone. And the people you are into may like different things, so there is no point to change yourself, because you can't match everyone's type anyway.

Secondly, you should never change yourself to be liked by anyone other than yourself. If each time you get rejected you believe it was because you weren't good enough and you must ""improve"" you are basically using someone's approval to value yourself. You shouldn't do that. You have to understand that what you consider to be the ideal version of yourself will not match what other people may think that version is. 

And if you continuously get rejected even if you are actively working on yourself can mean that you didn't make enough progress, but it can also be that you are attracted to people that are into different things. Maybe you are blonde and the guy you like prefers brunettes. Does that mean you should change your hair color? Maybe you are adventurous and the girl you are interested in likes guys who are not like that. Doea that mean you should stop doing what you like or that it's an improvement to stop doing your hobbies? No. 

Ask yourself: would I date myself? If the answer is yes then you are good enough the way you are.",[deleted]
dating,duj8om,2019-11-10 23:19:50,I officially have a girlfriend! (and so can you),"I(27m) am and always have been a super awkward guy.  I've always had horrible depression and have had trouble making friends.  You can't really imagine how effed up i was.  Crying all the time, super fatalistic, suicidal ideation... i had it all...  Plus I'm fat and ugly.  About 18 months ago I wanted to turn that part of my life around.  So I asked for help.  I'm a PhD student at a large university so I went into the mental health office to get triaged.  They found me a nurse practitioner at the university to handle medications for depression and anxiety.  They also refered me to a therapist in the next town over, and to the university's autism center, since I wanted to get screened for that.

Slow but steady progress over the next year, and then we land at july of 2019.  Social issues are part of my problem, and although I had gotten better I wanted to push more.  I joined a knitting group to get some practice with casual conversation, and find a group with which to work on my hobby.  After that, I wanted to find more social contact, but I also realized that someday I might want to start a family.  If I don't start now, I might never be ready...  So I got on OLD.

Over the next 4 months i was able to get about 4 first dates.  The first one was nice, but I was a little awkward.  The second one I really liked, but she wasn't into me; we're still friends though and occasionally text about crafting projects.  The third one went fine, but she decided to cut off contact.

Now for number 4.  As a man, the optimum strategy on OLD is to swipe right on everyone without looking, and filter later.  The yield is so small.  But we all know that occasionally, someone catches your eye.  You look at her pictures, read her bio, then realize that it would never happen, then you go back to swiping right.  In online dating, hope should be general, not specific.  To my surprise, someone who I had paused on ended up liking me back.  She(25f) seemed really enthusiastic and the text convo in the app was easy.  She complied when I suggest we move to phone text and then we scheduled a first date.  She was even more amazing in person.  She is as smart as anyone I've ever met (with a masters degree in a scientific field), super well versed in music history, had a sense of humour similar to mine, and she was very pretty.  We had lunch, walked around town, then found a nice place to sit and chat.  We lost track of time and ended up racking up over 6 hours.  Since then we texted pretty much every day, and had in person dates every other week (we live across town and are both fairly busy). Yesterday we had date 4, and we planned this to be a big one.  We decided to get dressed up and go to the symphony and get a nice dinner beforehand.  After dinner we start walking to the operahouse, but before we get to far, I pull out the jokes.

""I have something for you.  Give me your hand.""  She puts her hand on mine and I put a lime on hers. She looks confused.  I say, ‚ÄúThat was just an excuse to hold your hand.‚Äù  She laughs.  I then say ‚ÄúThat was my pick up lime.‚Äù  She then offers me her hand as we walk to the operahouse.

After the show we go back to my car, and i offer to drive her to her car, parked a few blocks away.  That is when we had the talk.  We just talk for like an hour about various things...  Starting with establishing that we want to be official.  After a nice conversation, we drive over to her car.  I get out to give her a hug goodnight... but somehow we just can't say goodbye.  We end up standing there in the freezing cold for another hour just because saying goodbye is so hard.  I eventually have to just say that if we have anything else to say, hopefully we'll have many more nights to say it.  We then have a very intense hug.  There were times over the past month where I knew she was almost perfect for me on paper, but I wasn't sure how much I viscerally emotionally wanted this.  Durring that hug I knew the spark was there.

I don't know how long things will last.  I don't know what happens now.  I will hope for the best and try what i can to make the best happen.  Here is what I do know.  I'm fat, I'm ugly, I was a lost cause.  [If i can find someone, anyone can.](https://i.imgur.com/W3JS9Gq.jpg) Keep hope alive.

&#x200B;

edit: I just wanted to say thanks for the overwhelming response, including silver.  I've come to this sub for help many times, but sometimes i feel like people lose hope on here.  My wish is that my post will provide some hope for those who are afraid they might be too far gone.  I know that now keeping this relationship together will take work, but at least I now have the chance.  Always keep the hope a lime in your heart.",">I'm fat, I'm ugly.

I'm a sappy shit when it comes to romantic settings and that really did it for me. I've been on a few dates now but that was the most romantic thing I could've dreamed of for a first kiss. Plus she's my type, into art, cars, neurochemistry and has my exact sense of humor and mannerisms. How could I not kiss a gem like her like holy shit. 

Side question. I asked if I could kiss her, it seems polite to me but is it normal or relevant to ask? She was looking like she wanted a kiss but I didn't want to make her uncomfortable by just doing it but I really wanted to kiss her. Fireworks either way I suppose.","Congratulations my friend.

dating,geq4eo,2020-05-06 18:58:22,"""You're perfect. You treat me so well, and I am always dying laughing, always looking forward to seeing you, but there is no spark.""","""You're perfect. You treat me so well, and I am always dying laughing, always looking forward to seeing you, but there is no spark.""

This is a post I just need to make to vent and get some advice here. Sorry for the ramble, I'll try to keep it short. I met this girl through work, she reached out to me because we had a work related phone convo and she felt I was special. We instantly hit it off, talked over text and the phone like crazy all day. We eventually met in person for the first time and had an amazing time. We didn't have sex but I went down on her and honestly gave her one of the most intense O's i've ever seen someone have, not to toot my own horn. But I felt pretty good. We cuddled the rest of the night before I had to go home. We live over an hour apart. All along the while, she makes me laugh and feel great. I honestly thought everything was perfect. I try to be reserved at first but I was getting these ""she may be the one"" feelings even after a week. Maybe the fact she let me eat her out on the first date was a red flag that she was just looking for something more casual.

But this whole time she kept complimenting me, saying how great I was, how she is glad nobody has taken me off the market.. all the things you want to hear from someone who seems like they want a real relationship.

She asked me out on a 2nd date, and well during quarantine there isn't a whole lot to do, so we ended up waiting in line for several hours for some food at a packed drive thru that is always packed and takes hours. She didn't even like the food, but knew I'd never had it before so we went.  We got out of the car and danced together, we sang together, held hands, kissed.. I mean what did I miss here?

Why would someone do all that if they didn't feel anything? -- She starts telling me how she has trust issues and is afraid of being hurt, how she never has had a good relationship and doesn't know how to take care of it, etc... And normally she would just ghost or tell people to fuck off, but she really cares about me. She said she really wanted me to know that she was going through this because she felt I was special.

So I let her have some space while she does that, but she just pulls away.

Wtf mate? I just don't get it. Asked her what was up and we talked on the phone. I asked if there was something I could do to help her through this trust issue and she said it would help if I could tell her how I felt. So I put myself out there and was just honest. Told her I was crazy about her, how I want to keep getting to know her and go out more, how much I enjoy talking with her.  She ends up saying that Everything about me is amazing. That I treat her like a queen, that she is always dying laughing around me, that she always looks forward to hearing from me or seeing me.. But just ""something"" isn't there. Like there is no spark...  But she really feels I am special and cares about me.

So I had to tell her that I just can't really continue like that then and think we shouldnt talk much anymore. She keeps saying she is sorry and we hang up..

I am confused. I know I should just love myself and not care, but everything seemed perfect. I am normally pretty good at spotting my mistakes, or seeing signs they aren't interested.. But she gave so many she was. From all the affection she was giving, to playing love songs in the car while we waited, to touching me, kissing me, grabbing my hand to hold. Was I too nice? I wasn't unconfident, clingy or anything of the like.. Just said sweet things.

I seriously hate dating. I don't know what it is about me that pushes people away, but I am reserved at first and can take a minute to get to know. That doesn't ever seem to create any ""spark"" at all for people and I just am lost. If you suffered through this. Help. I'd be glad to elaborate or answer any questions.

&#x200B;

EDIT:

&#x200B;

I just have to say that I truly appreciate all of you. I can't tell you how much healing I feel I've done today simply by having you all respond to me. I will try to respond to everyone, the amount of messages has been overwhelming. I just really need to say that the love has really made my day so much better. I feel much stronger than I did earlier. You all gave me varied insight into what I should be doing. ","Hey man. Ever heard of self sabotage? This girl just did that. She sabotaged herself, she had a great thing with someone and she stopped it from happening because she didn‚Äôt want to enjoy something so much and eventually have it ripped away from her. I relate to her in a way. I am always, ALWAYS expecting the worst to happen, and my instinct is to choose survival over enjoyment in all aspects of life. So, I think what happened is that she expected things to crash and burn between you two (her saying she‚Äôs never had a great relationship and that she has trust issues), and she ran away before it could happen. It isn‚Äôt right, and I know it hurts. But it‚Äôs also not personal. The spark wasn‚Äôt there because vulnerability is probably the X factor that was missing on her side. Being vulnerable builds trust, and trust builds intimacy, and intimacy produces a spark. Believe her when she says she has trust issues. But don‚Äôt believe for one second that you did anything wrong here. It was probably as great as it seemed, and I am really sorry that this happened. You will meet a woman that is just right for you, be patient. I‚Äôm with you."

I have had very successful picnic first dates due to the lockdown. It is absolutely very romantic and can really increase romantic feelings between a couple. A few little pieces of advice for guys and picnics. Get a nice bag, doesn't have to be a picnic basket, but something that's a upgrade from a disposable grocery bag.  Make at least one or two things. It shows a woman a lot of effort when you make something. The simplest thing I always make is a jalapeno cheese dip. Just shredded cheddar cheese, cream cheese and a little diced pickled jalapenos. 30secs to a min in the microwave and stir.  But its homemade and she will love the effort. The other homemade item that goes well is a homemade cocktail. Super simple. Deep Eddy lemon vodka, chopped up strawberries and sprite with some ice, homemade original Hard strawberry lemonade, perfect for a picnic.  If you want to know more, contact me I actually have a complete checklist for everything to make sure its successful and you don't forget anything.  Best of luck!

But there are plenty of times where I was dating someone but had to stay in to study for my exam and they were not willing to work with me.

- It‚Äôs still not cool to talk about a stranger‚Äôs body unless they‚Äôve consent in someway.

I really like this guy and wanted tonight to go over smoothly. But the catch... after we had slept together, as I was getting dressed, there was a towel on the bed that wasn‚Äôt there and saw a smudge of red on my pants I was about to put on. I put two and two together and realized I had my period and had ruined his sheets. He was sweet enough to try to conceal the spot under the towel. I had quietly remarked ‚ÄúI think I ruined your sheets‚Äù and he said ‚Äúoh, are there other spots on the bed?‚Äù casually and continued to say ‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry about it, it‚Äôll wash right out‚Äù. I offered to buy him a set of new sheets and he again told me not to worry and jokingly ‚Äúit adds color to the room‚Äù... I mean, I‚Äôm still pretty mortified it happened and will probably buy him sheets anyway but he handled it so well. Thankful there are guys out there that know what to do in these situations.

Can i get some feedback, and prayers...","My (f) boyfriend (m) sent me a funny video (not a meme, but kinda) of a family who flip their birthday cake every cake and see if they can catch it without dropping it. Hilarious stuff. 

My reaction was ""whoa that family must be insane! Like, can't we all just sit down calmly and eat a piece a cake?"". Perfectly innocent you're thinking. Wrong. Perfectly granny-like and unappealing. He made a comment about it revealing my inner boomer (I'm in my 30s) and joked that it wasn't sexy. 

The only problem is that it's true. Less than a month later he dumped me. I know he didn't dump me over the video, but he did say that it was (partly) because we couldn't have fun. It's absolutely true. I'm not a fun person. I don't have enthusiasm for life. I don't enjoy anything really. And no one wants to be with someone like that. It was an 18 month relationship (my first relationship) - he tried hard but he just couldn't put up with me any longer. 

In the past men have always dumped me after a few weeks citing that I'm ""a really nice person"". Now I realise it's code for ""you're so boring and not like normal girls"". Before anyone suggests that i change, i am who i am, i can't artificially manufacture a joy for life that doesn't exist. All i want is to be loved and this has really clarified that no man is going to put up with me. My heart is breaking.

dating,g6upkb,2020-04-23 20:53:27,"[Rant] Why ""being happy being single"" isn't always a good thing.","Sorry in advance for this wall of text, quarantine has just lead me to doing a lot of self-reflection and introspection on things. 

I've spent a lot of time recently reading this subreddit and a few others. The same advice seems to come up quite a bit when people talk about having difficulties getting dates, forming relationships, etc: Work on yourself. Improve yourself. Be happy with yourself single or you won't be happy in a relationship. Be the person you'd want to date. 

Firstly, I'd just like to say that in general this IS very good advice. We should always be looking to improve ourselves as people. Not necessarily just for the sake of dating/meeting a partner, but just to make our lives better as a whole. 

But there's something else I'd like to address here. 

There seems to be a prevailing attitude in quite a few dating advice forums that essentially boils down to ""be okay with being single"". At face value this seems like a good approach; if you're not happy being on your own, why drag another person down with you? But I'd like to make a potential counter-argument to this, or at least partly.

There seems to be two possible perspectives here:

1) Be happy with yourself as a person, while you just so happen to be single.

2) Be happy being single, as a status or condition of your life.

The first one is, in my opinion, very solid advice. And in general I'd say that in most areas of my life I am very happy with how things are going. I've got a stable job, solid group of friends, in good shape, do things that make me happy and improve myself as a person, you get the idea. 

However, the second one can be...dangerous, to put it one way.

I'm a 27 year old guy, and have never had a girlfriend in my life. Never had sex, never kissed anyone, blah blah you've heard this story before. When I was younger it wasn't that big of a deal, really. There was so much other stuff happening in life that dating and relationships were pretty much on the back burner. But going into college, and after graduating, I started realizing something might be wrong. All my friends and peers were in dedicated long-term relationships, or were at least having success when it came to casual dating. I was the odd man out. So I decided to make some changes and did my research. That lead to a commitment to self-improvement, which I'm still pursuing to this day. At first things seemed to be looking up; my confidence improved, I felt much better about myself as a person, and generally had a better outlook on life.

But the one area that remained the same was my romantic/dating life, or lack thereof. I felt good about myself as a person who just so happened to be single. However, I still wasn't happy with BEING single. 

My friends tried to help, and a lot of them took the approach of telling me how great being single is. Not having to worry about arguments/relationship troubles/etc. But to me that always felt like a bit of a cop-out answer. Imagine telling someone who was dying of thirst ""Oh, water? Yeah it's okay I guess, but it's not *that* great."" 

That lack of dating success started bleeding into other areas of my life. What confidence I'd built up pretty much vanished after I was rejected a number of times, and still hasn't come back. It also feels like I'm the verge of having depressive episodes almost every day. I tried to think of other areas that needed to be improved, that could possibly be leading to this back-track in the progress I'd made. But it always came back to my perpetual state of being alone. 

It feels like a constant feedback loop. I can't seem to make any progress when it comes to dating, which means that there must be something wrong with me. There's something wrong with me, which means I won't have any success trying to date/form relationships. This also contributes to a concern that at this point it's too late for me, that nobody will want to go out with a 27 year old who's never had a girlfriend in his life. From an outside perspective, it's easy to see how someone might think there's some serious underlying issues there that would explain this lack of experience.

What I'm trying to say (in an admittedly very verbose way) is this: The advice of ""be happy being single"" isn't always great, at least in the long term. While I like myself as a person who's single, the idea of being alone for the rest of my life is terrifying and feeds back into some of the negative self-talk that has sprouted from a lack of romantic experiences. I don't want to be single; I want to be able to form healthy relationships like everyone else, to have that intimacy and trust with another person but have never been able to experience so far. It feels like I've been missing out on one of the most rewarding things life has to offer, and everyone says ""oh, just be okay with it!"".","Thank you for being honest. Whenever people try to convince themselves or others they're happy being single it reeks of settling tbh. ""Settling"" doesn't only apply when you're in a relationship either. Some ppl have settled for being alone when they really don't want to be because they've given up. You can usually tell a person who is genuinely happy being single compared to one who is just trying to convince themselves they're OK with it. 

The ones who are genuinely happy with it aren't on dating sites or dating site forums/discussion boards complaining about why they can't meet their match.

It's better to be transparent. I'm single and it's OK but there are times I'd like to be in a relationship as well. It's normal to want to be with someone. However, I'm not willing to settle for a dysfunctional, incompatible or unhealthy relationship either just to say ""I have a man"". Honestly, I hate dating but it's ***very unrealistic*** to go from 100% single to in a relationship without the dating process."
dating,jt5ww4,2020-11-12 23:30:47,My boyfriend broke up with me bc I was fat,"Okay, it was more complicated than that, but the underlying issue was that I (20F) had gained some weight and he (24M) never even told me it bothered him. I was going through a lot at the time, and I wasn‚Äôt really prioritizing my health, but I still was more active and ate better than he ever did! Jerk.

Anyway, I‚Äôve lost thirty pounds, and I‚Äôm actually fitter than I‚Äôve ever been before (thanks to quarantine). We broke up about nine months ago, and I know it‚Äôs petty to judge people for how they look, but now I feel like I have a subconscious fear of ever being broken up with for the same reason again, so I feel like I can only date people who are also fit because, otherwise, I might get too comfortable eating junk food and exercising less.

Am I crazy?! How do I stop caring so much? I really don‚Äôt want to be a petty human and exclude potential men just for their lifestyles, but I also want to set a benchmark to help me sustain my healthy lifestyle. Any advice/anecdotes would be super helpful. Thank you :)",I think its totally normal to seek someone who can support you with a healthy lifestyle. Its like someone who is a recovering addict wouldnt date someone who is very much into drugs or alcohol because that just wouldnt be a good situation for them. At the end of the day you just gotta do what you need for yourself to be successful and happy in life.

Good conversation has several ingredients:
Interest and curiousity
Overlapping understanding between all parties 
A capacity for empathy
The ability to listen for understanding instead of just waiting to speak.
Mutual interests.
Probably need at least 3 of these. And if the primary motivation factor for one party is sex well almost none of these things  will occur naturally.

In my experience it's not like the women are trying very hard either.

Online dating is 40% people only trying to get laid.
50% window shopping/looking for validation.
10% searching for something long term or husband/wife searching."

We clicked so well that we ended up talking for 8 hours throughout the night and slept at 7am.

We wanted to catch up but the cab services were down (travel history was checked from both ends). Spent the whole day talking on video call when at 1.30 in the night, I just happened to check the cab services and one showed nearby. I sent a request, it got accepted and I was on my way. I was so scared and honestly felt my guts shivering for the fear of being stopped by cops.

Reached her place, she wasn't a serial killer(thank god!) and ended up spending the night and the next night at her place. We then moved to my place on Tuesday and have been here since.

It's so much fun having her around, not to mention the fact that we both like cooking so all the free time goes in cooking something delicious (she's a better cook, hands down!).

I guess I'm one of the few ones who's seriously enjoying this quarantine and hoping that it doesn't end too soon!

If you have a quarantine Valentine, I'm hoping you're having as much fun as I am!

UPDATE: Got a request for an update so here it is. We had our first fight. In the middle of while things were getting hot. For what you ask - because as I pulled her hair (which she likes) she suddenly realised a few of those locks are falling out. Cue mental breakdown and blue balls.

dating,timalg,2022-03-20 14:30:28,My GF wants a break to pursue something with another guy,"I (23M) am in a difficult situation with my SO (22F). 

We've been dating for 6 years. We started towards the end of high school and continued through the entirety of my college education. I graduated in December and moved across the country to start my first job out of college. My SO graduates this August after she's done with an internship this summer, so there's some element of a short-term long-distance relationship at play here. 

She just visited for spring break, only to drop a bombshell on me. I mean, we are talking completely out of left field here‚Äìbut more on why I think that later. She told me that she caught feelings for another guy back home, also that she wasn't sure if she ever felt love due to the young age we both were when the relationship started (about 16,17), and hasn't felt happy in our relationship for quite some time. 

A complete emotional wreck, I attempted to figure out as much as possible why she's come to feel this way. Apparently, she's gone through some kind of major personality change, driven mostly by this one guy, and she doesn't think that we can reconcile the differences to preserve what we've built over the last 6 years. Even stranger, when she first described him to me, she said we were so similar its like I never left. So like... ??? What are the differences we cant reconcile if we're that similar? She seems to think that being happy with me is an impossibility going forward. 

I'm completely floored by this. Not only is this situation quite honestly the first hiccup in our entire time together (like seriously, we havent really ever fought about anything because we've always been good about compromise and problem resolution), we were talking about engagement rings and getting married literally weeks ago in February. It was a conversation that ended up with her being so happy she almost broke into tears. She even went and found out her ring size for me. She's never been one to be wishy washy with her feelings or with the way she feels about me, and is certainly not the kind of person who's ever given me mixed signals before. 

Admittedly, I haven't been doing the long distance as well as I could have, but I always felt very secure in our relationship, and this whole situation has kind of kicked me into high gear. I'm still wildly in love with her, and I want to jump into our relationship with both feet and make our relationship of 6 years that much stronger. As of right now, she wants none of that. 

Further complicating things is that she has an internship in the same city I'm living in, and we plan to live together for June - August for her internship. Ever slept in the same bed with someone who broke your heart? Yeah, I'm not looking forward to it if shit doesn't work out. 

As of right now, we've decided to pause our relationship (go on a break, I guess) until June rolls around and see how we both feel then. I guess I'm still in denial because I'm pretty confident things will work out for us. Cause if it doesn't, I'll have to face the near crippling loneliness of being half a continent away from anyone who's ever cared about me, and I don't think I'm strong enough to make it through that. 

I really think that we can fix things this summer. I think she's confused about her emotions for this other guy and she's seeking out short term happiness (a fixable problem) over long term stability and love (not something easy to build or find). I also think that she's beginning to feel the throes of graduation anxiety and doesn't want to ""give up"" (for lack of a better phrase) all the college friends, family, and other things that come from staying where we grew up. I just feel like her judgment is clouded somehow. 

Am I stupid for thinking this is fixable? I just need some discussion, I can't sort through all this stuff by myself and be productive about it.",When an SO develops romantic feelings for another individual who is not their current partner that means they already have one foot out the door.

I'm talking more about like, anywhere other than that.","There‚Äôs nothing sexier than a man‚Äôs erection pressing against his jeans, against your leg, while you‚Äôre making out.

The entire night. The.Entire.Night. She didn‚Äôt ask me one single question. If there was any pause in the conversation or dull it was soon filled with me asking yet another question about herself and if I didn‚Äôt there would be complete silence. Sometimes she would look at me and giggle and I quickly came to loathe it because why the fuck not.

Why is it always like this. This isn‚Äôt the first time this has happened. I know there are women out there with social skills above kindergarten level. Why do they text like a normal adult yet when we meet they literally ask nothing about me. Fucking nothing. I get being nervous. I get being anxious but for the love of fucking Christ ask me literally anything about myself. Am I wrong for asking for just a little interest? That you show just a little bit of interest in my life? 

Wow cool rings where did you get them? 
How‚Äôs work?
What do you do on the weekend? 
Blah blah blah it‚Äôs not hard it really isn‚Äôt. Please try. Please just try a tiny bit. 
She even said she liked how many questions I asked her and how interested I was. SO WHY THE FUCK DIDNT YOU ASK ANYTHING. She is a grown women and is still incapable of basic communication. Fuck this I hate dating sometimes, it‚Äôs not always like this but it‚Äôs far too often. I don‚Äôt understand if they know how annoying they‚Äôre being or they just lack the skill to be social with new people but this is pathetic and I‚Äôm going insane. This is another night I wasted.

EDIT: Thank you everyone for your comments I do really appreciate it and the kind words you gave me. It‚Äôs good to know in a weird way that I‚Äôm not the only one who‚Äôs had this experience. 
Here‚Äôs some details that I‚Äôve been asked a few times so I‚Äôll put the answers here 
1. After dinner I suggested we end it but she wanted to continue and walk+talk. By that she means I continue to ask her things about her life. 
2. The ring question was just an example but yes I do wear some silver rings, nothing big or fancy just a couple that my mum gave me and one my sister made for me. 
3. She may of been anxious but she told me through text she‚Äôs extroverted, she works in a position that deals with all types of customers and she never looked at her phone during the date, just sat there staring at me until I asked her something else. I thought alcohol might help but it didn‚Äôt.
4. Men absolutely do this shit too I imagine. 
5. I met my two previous partners through online dating, my last ex was great, she asked me things and was generally interested in me and I was into her. That‚Äôs why we got into a relationship and lasted for quite some time. So there is obviously women out there who can communicate, it‚Äôs not all women and there is obviously men out there who are just as shallow as the woman I went on a date with. Online dating does work, it‚Äôs just that there‚Äôs too many people like the one I went on a date with who are so self absorbed. 


Thank you again to those who reached out to me or commented here I really appreciate it :)","Just to be clear because people in the comments seem confused, this happens to both men and women who are trying to date. I've had a couple of guys do this to me.

She said she was settling for me, and that she's been with much more physically attractive men. My heart sank when she said that. We've been together for almost two years now and it's pretty much destroyed me.

How do you cope with the fact that your girlfriend slept with much more attractive men in the past?

I looked at some other reddit posts and people say things like ""she chose you in the end, so you came out on top of all of those guys in her past."" But I'm sure she would have rather have been with those more attractive guys, if the guy had been willing to be in a proper relationship. So that's not consoling at all.

Edit:

I asked her about it this morning before work and she brushed it off saying she was joking. I told her it really hurt and she apologized but it felt shallow.

dating,mmq4si,2021-04-08 11:55:23,Am I the only one who doesn't understand 'Hard to get?',"I (M23) hear all of these dumb ass rules about not texting back too fast, or seeming too free/having too much free time. There's also the old 'wait three days after you get their number' shit.

I just don't understand how someone not being interested in you is appealing. Like, if I see a text, I'm gonna reply. Sometimes I'm on my phone and it will be right away, sometimes I don't see it for 2 hours. My favorite conversations in OLD have been when we are messaging back in forth.

I'm not usually a talkative person, but if I like someone, I'm gonna try to talk to them. Almost nothing seems less appealing than a girl not reciprocating interest.

People say you seem to desperate if you respond too fast, yet expect someone to case after them. And when exactly does 'hard to get end,' when are you allowed to admit that you're interested. No one ever talks about that, just to act uninterested to seem more interesting, but sooner or later they will get sick of it.

Do you want to get drinks‚Äù line) and he basically invited me over to study. 
I said yes and sorry for not responding for the past couple of days, that I‚Äôve just been really busy. I was still really, really, nervous to see him in person but since posting on here that visceral shame and embarrassment definitely died down. When i got to his apartment , I immediately got it out of the way and just said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry if I made things weird the other night‚Äù
To which kind of played with me and just laughed and ironically said ‚Äúoh? The other night, what happened the other night? I have no idea what you‚Äôre talking about.‚Äù 
Then he literally just asked me f I wanted a glass of wine and moved on. Like that was it. I‚Äôd been freaking petrified that he‚Äôd think I was weird or it would fuck  everything up and he literally moved past it in a second. That‚Äôs when I realized guys were right!! He didn‚Äôt care, it wasn‚Äôt an issue. At all!
After that we just studied all morning and he didn‚Äôt bring it up again.
Bonus note: we ended up sleeping together, not sexually just falling asleep in his bed after lunch and he didn‚Äôt try anything at all, which made me feel even better bcz I was worried that the whole 1st date public orgasm would make him view me as easy.

Edit for clarification: I‚Äôm not ghosting him, I was planning on just avoiding him before I made my original post but you guys convinced me to get over being embarrassed. I just spent the whole day at his apartment, he‚Äôs very much not currently ghosted.",Aw that‚Äôs so sweet!!! What a wonderful conclusion to your anxiety over the situation! I love that he joked with you. When the title said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm ghosting him‚Ä¶‚Äù I got scared for a moment that something happened. I wish you all the best and hope for a bright and beautiful future if that‚Äôs what is meant to be. as much as I‚Äôd love more updates haha this was nice! :)
dating,13t8q12,2023-05-27 14:19:34,New boyfriend lasts maybe 30 seconds.,"My boyfriend(27m) and I(26f) waited several weeks to have sex. I‚Äôm a mom & I need to make sure anyone I‚Äôm dating is dating for the right reasons. Establishing a relationship before getting sexual is important to me. I do also know that sexual chemistry is important. Him and I had sex for the first time 2 weeks ago, & it lasted 30 seconds from inserting. I thought maybe a fluke because it was our first time & he is not at all the type to sleep with someone unless they‚Äôre in a relationship. We tried again lastnight, he lasted 30 seconds again. I‚Äôm frustrated because I‚Äôd like the enjoy that time again, & see what kind of sexual chemistry we have. 

Any advice?","Give him time and some more practice. This may be the most action he's gotten this year.

I went from lasting half an hour to lasting 3 minutes after a year without."

Don‚Äôt take it personal. And next time you see her don‚Äôt make it weird. Just smile and move on.
dating,p9xjdp,2021-08-23 11:05:18,Am I overreacting?,"I (23 m) started talking to this girl (22 f) and we had what felt like a connection. We went on a movie date some days after and it went really well. We then found that we both have had experiences of domestic violence. A past relationship for her and growing up with family for me. We spoke about sex and she said she'd like to wait as she hasn't fully healed. 

Fast forward 2 weeks and I find out she knows a friend of mine (he doesn't know I know her). Then a couple days after I find out they have indeed been having sex. 

After finding this out I decided to delete myself from the situation and have barely been returning any of her texts. 

She texted once saying I'm overreacting and I only stopped talking to her because of my friend. I've just found it funny that she's yet to address the not being able to have sex because of DV. She's acting like we never had the conversation


**Edit: Thanks for all the advice. I should clarify a couple details.
1. We went on 2 dates.
2. She asked about sex then proceeded to offer the DV information.
3. The issue for me wasn't that she'd been with a friend or anyone else. It's the lying with a sensitive topic and refusing address it that ticked me off
4. I only found out they had sex because we ended up in a setting together and they did it just before everyone went home. She knew I'd be there and didn't say anything about it.

Thanks people. It was good having different views. 
There's not much I can do. Tried talking it out on multiple occasions but that didn't work. So I'll keep to staying away from her. 
Also, I won't be mentioning it to my friend because I don't see how I can without revealing sensitive information on both of us.","I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre going through this. You are not overreacting. You‚Äôre allowed to be upset, and what she is doing seems a bit like gas lighting. Not remembering conversations, acting like they didn‚Äôt happen and this isn‚Äôt a big deal. Your feelings matter and your not overreacting."

dating,rchusa,2021-12-09 13:38:34,Can‚Äôt go over to guys place,"I started dating an older guy from Tinder and something just isn‚Äôt right. I haven‚Äôt been to his house and he‚Äôs very vague about his living situation. He always says I live with my ‚Äúcousin‚Äù. His cousin can‚Äôt always be home ? Does he not work ? We supposedly live in the same area/city so I asked near what store and street name.

He told me the store, but said ‚ÄúOh I can‚Äôt remember the street name‚Äù.... and switched the conversation. So basically from all this I think he‚Äôs married or has someone. He recently bought up sex and even went as far as saying he‚Äôll pay for a hotel/motel. I immediately declined. I live with parents so he knows not to ask to come over my place. 
I don‚Äôt really knows what‚Äôs going on. He NEVER talks about this cousin. 
But I guess it‚Äôs my fault I should ask more questions, but I feel when I do it‚Äôs very vague. I hear more from him on the weekdays while he‚Äôs at work than weekends when he‚Äôs off.

He works construction 7-5 apparently. I don‚Äôt hear from him after 8-9. He says because he falls asleep.

He love bombs a lot even though we barley have been associated. I never NOT had a guy try to bring/invite me to his place. I‚Äôm not too deep in yet, we‚Äôve only been meeting for almost 2 months. 

Am I tripping lol or onto something ?

Edit: Well guess my intuition was right. Now I just have to find out what to do. Thanks guys
And I‚Äôm guessing this wife or significant other is there all day or maybe he even has kids ?

Edit: I asked him again and this time he said his cousin‚Äôs WIFE lives there too and is always home. Then he said you don‚Äôt have to worry baby we will get our own house IM DONE. He didn‚Äôt tell me that at first. Well now it makes me thinks he‚Äôs definitely married and it‚Äôs really HIS WIFE. This is funny ! He actually thinks I believe him.","Your gut is spot on, this dude is married."

I hope you find your one as well.",good to hear. stop putting yourself down. you were yourself and thats probably why she likes you. at the end of the day dont put on an act to impress somebody. they should like you for you. hopefully it all works out.
dating,hety2z,2020-06-24 04:07:26,I just want to find a decent man...,"Someone who actually gives a shit. They care about you as much as you care about them. They aren‚Äôt afraid of being public with you, they don‚Äôt look at every other girl and make comments about their bodies. They don‚Äôt take complete advantage of you. They don‚Äôt call you whipped if you do something nice like make breakfast. It‚Äôs not all about sex, you have nights where you just talk for hours and hours. Were I don‚Äôt feel used. I‚Äôm not made to feel like a dumb ass when I have feelings. Someone who supports me, who talks me through bad times. I want to be treated how I treat them. I hate one sided relationships. Someone who just loves me and will say it, not once a month when I‚Äôm not in the mood to have sex and they use that as their tactic so you let your guard down. I know they exist, I just don‚Äôt know how to find someone like that. It feels like something just in books or for other people. Gorgeous people, who have great jobs, a big house and nice cars. Not all around average... 

I settle for the assholes because that‚Äôs the kind of men I grew up around. My uncles, dad who left when I was a week old, everyone. That‚Äôs what I think I deserve. Hell, if a guy acted the way I hope for one day- I‚Äôd be scared I‚Äôd run for the hills because I‚Äôd think they had ulterior motives. I fucking hate it. Is there anyone that‚Äôs had a really awful dating history and found their soulmate out there? To give me a little hope?


Edit: okay, I (24F) didn‚Äôt expect this to blow up like this at all, holy shit. Umm, I‚Äôll give more background? So a skimmed comments because there‚Äôs... a lot... lol. And a lot are saying therapy, I did go to therapy but it was for my childhood trauma and the experience wasn‚Äôt my favorite so I left. Now, I saw one person talk about abandonment issues, I do have those but I don‚Äôt really have a fear of being left behind. I‚Äôve never had someone that I‚Äôve noticed make an impact after leaving, well maybe my dad but I‚Äôd rather be with my mom (as much of a ‚Äúmom‚Äù as she is) than an alcoholic drug addict around me as an example to look up to. I just don‚Äôt know what a good relationship looks like is my problem. I‚Äôve only been in two relationships, one I was left at a bar in the worst part of downtown because the ‚Äúreally nice guy‚Äù flipped out all of the sudden claiming I was getting him drunk (he bought a bottle of vodka, I drank a cup of rum and coke- I‚Äôm not a big drinker and he was, that‚Äôs not my fault). Now the one I‚Äôm one foot in one foot out is the one that‚Äôs really messed me up for good. I tried leaving when I noticed he was changing, after becoming this person he molded himself into so I would fall for him because he was ‚Äúwhat I was looking for‚Äù, but this guy. This is not someone that you can run from. He buys new phone numbers, gets new social media accounts, puts numbers under different numbers- I mean you can only imagine what someone going to school for cybersecurity can do. Anyways, after two attempts to get away from him he took it as a chance to trap me. Now, with my mental health issues (major chronic depression, anxiety and panic disorder, etc etc the fun list goes on) cause me to be safer to not be on birth control. So, I don‚Äôt take it- and that‚Äôs a very very well known fact I make clear if they show interest. Well, after being together for two and a half months he got tired of me trying to leave and ‚Äúgetting mad at him.‚Äù Now I‚Äôm stuck with him in some way for 18 years and 5 months. Now it‚Äôs not only manipulation to get me back, now it‚Äôs him threatening lawyers, to take my baby, etc etc etc because that I can‚Äôt run from. He‚Äôs an awful human being and I just don‚Äôt know how I can put myself in the dating world once I get both feet out after him... so yeah, I didn‚Äôt put my history on here because when I do have my posts about him men say awful things to me and are on his side so I wanted this one to be vague.

dating,12hg8k9,2023-04-10 11:41:22,Married (almost) 15 years after meeting wife in online dating. A few tips/life lessons for men and women on dating.,"For Women:


1.	Men don't get complimented, like at all, ever. You don't have to fawn over someone, but if you tell a guy, ""Nice Watch"" on a date you better damn believe that man is going to be wearing that watch at his funeral. I've had women compliment different parts of my body (non-sexually) and I'm pretty sure I remember every one of those compliments I've ever gotten.


2.	Men, especially young men are absolutely terrified that they might be mistaking the moves you are making on him as being innocent. It would be humiliating to us to think you were coming on to us when you were not. You need to be absolutely clear with a guy if you are coming on to him. You need to say, ""I'd really like it if we went out on a date sometime to get coffee or play mini-golf"". Many guys won't pick up on it unless you use the words ""on a date"".


3.	Point number 2 goes double for sexual interest. We can be our own worst enemies and completely miss things. Example, I took a girl to the Marine Corps ball before I met my wife. We had a great time, and on my way driving her back to her car she said I wished that night didn't have to end, she said it didn't have to and she kissed me passionately... so I took her to Waffle House because it was the middle of the night and no place else was open. Now, it may be obvious to you what she was saying but it was completely over my head because I couldn't imagine a girl that pretty being into me.


4.	I've had girls I dated be really shallow and not want to talk about themselves for fear of being embarrassed. Do you know what my wife did on our first date that no one else did (no, not that, get your head out of the gutter)... she talked about what she was passionate about and interested in. My wife was a huge book worm, a nerd, and a big Star Trek fan. Ladies, we don't care what your hobby is, if you are passionate about it that makes you interesting to us. I've now watched every episode of every Star Trek series with my wife (actually, 5 left of TOS plus the animated series and the latest Picard but you get the idea).


5.	Be confident in yourself and tell that guy you like that you like him clearly as shown above. When I left high school I had not 1, not 2, but 3 girls moving out of town for college confess to me that they really like me and would have dated me if I had asked. All thought they had made their feelings clear but these all came out of left field.


6.	There is no man, not one single man on this planet that wouldn't be pleasantly surprised if someone wonderful became a part of theirs.


7.	Despite what you might think from reading Reddit, not every man on a dating site is just looking for a hookup.

For Men:


1. I never successfully asked a girl out on a date in person. From middle school all the way up to age 21, every girl I asked out in person turned me down. It was not until I became everything that people say women are shallow about or complain about (tall, in shape, in uniform, money, stable career) that I had any luck, and then only with online dating. With the exception of being tall, every one of those things is something that you can change. Work on yourself to be a better prospective date for a potential mate. If you are only trying to get dates online, work on your in person skills. If you are only trying to date in person, try online. One is not necessarily better than the other, but more of an ‚Äúall of the above approach‚Äù. You will see no getting dates in person advice from me because I failed completely at that.


2. Start with your standards low and work on your dating skills. I fumbled through so many dates before I figured out how not to be an ass. This is not saying sleep around with everyone. This is saying take someone out on a date to putt putt or bowling and practice your talking skills with the opposite sex whether or not you believe there is a potential long term relationship there. You will improve your ‚Äútalking skills‚Äù over time.  


3. Talked to my wife about how she ended up going out on a date with me as opposed to the loads of other people in her inbox. She said that she got lots of messages like, ‚Äúhy u, u look reaaally gud, do u thin u maight wanna drinnnk and stuff‚Äù? Those went straight to the trash. In other words, use basic grammar and be respectful. I always asked out girls to mini-golf and icecream. If it is a date an 8 year old would like, your date probably would to. How many people do you think are trying to buy her a drink?


4. Date locations should be in a safe neutral location. No picking up at house (unless they ask). Have safety in mind for her. What would be a safe meeting/date for an internet stranger? It didn‚Äôt click in my head that a few of the girls I‚Äôd talked to online that had turned me down were doing so out of self preservation until one my potential dates told me she wasn‚Äôt comfortable being picked up for a first date. I did much better afterwards. Safety first.


5. Women absolutely judge you by your pictures and what is in them. I‚Äôm confident I scared off many potential dates as most of my dating profile photos had me holding a gun (I was in the USMC) because I thought it looked cool. Helping my brother with his profile, he had much better luck when there was something different about him in his photos than everyone else. I have not been on a dating site in a decade, but I‚Äôm guessing most profile photos of guys are of a smiling guy in the woods well dressed trying to look cool. Do you think it would be easier for a woman to respond to that, or to the same guy on a beach holding a piglet? One has much easier potential openings. My brother‚Äôs success went up when he switched from the woods profile to the holding animal on beach profile.


6. If you really are trying to find a life partner and not just a hookup, listen. Listen to your date, then girlfriend and when you get further in the relationship pet her. I don‚Äôt know that all women like it, but my wife loves pets and will talk to me all day if I‚Äôm rubbing her feet. 

Finally, guys and gals. Good luck to you out there. This all may no longer be relevant and the dating landscape may have completely changed but I hope all of you find that special someone in your life. Good luck!",I thoroughly enjoyed reading this. Wise words and thank you!
dating,kqeucf,2021-01-04 18:41:30,"Approached my long time crush this week-end, was not disappointed!","Hey guys, just wanted to write a little something on here today from a good experience I had yesterday.

So I've (43M) had this crush, or attraction, for one of my daughter's friends mother (44F), for years. I remember it even dating back to when I was with my kids mother, over 6 years ago, but of course it was just platonic and I wouldn't have done anything back then, her being with her kids father as well.

About 2 years ago, she split from her kids dad, and i was in a committed relationship at the time, it crossed my mind that it was bad timing, but no biggie. I had recently bought a house with my GF at the time and she sort of asked me for advice on buying a house, one day while waiting for our kids in the schoolyard.

I broke up with my aforementioned GF about 18 months ago and wanted to date again, around last February... I checked  out said ""crush"" on Facebook and saw that she clearly was with some other dude. Too bad, wrong timing again, but I still sent her a friend's request, which she didn't accept, and now I'm glad that she didn't.

So fast forward to yesterday, when my daughter mentioned her daughter, since they've recently rekindled their friendship. Checked her out on FB (the mom, you creep!) and she seems very single, so I sent her a friend's request, which she accepted pretty quickly... I guess it doesn't necessarily mean anything but I saw it as something positive. Didn't want to get too excited and send her a message right away, so decided to sleep on it and give it a good 24 hours.

Established a strategic time to DM her, around 7pm on a quiet Sunday evening before most likely being back at work tomorrow. I was a bit nervous because it's been a few years since I had seen her and had never spoken to her in this context, i guess. Took me a while to craft a small message where i asked her how the holidays were for her and her family, if she remembered me from a few years back, etc...

I was happily surprised that she reciprocated with her own set of questions and comments on some FB pictures that i have, said she remembered me from being the ""Bike daddy"", since back then i was driving my kids to school and cycling from their school to work everyday. She casually mentioned a few activities that she's been doing lately, like hiking & snowboarding, which i also love. In my 4th or 5th answer, i mentioned that I've been running a lot lately and she said that she also loves running.

The conversation naturally slowed down at some point, I've learned in passed experiences to not be pushy this early on and just to sort of leave the door open, but she then asked me if I would like to go running with her this week. I was very happy about that and I fully intend on following up tonight with her, as today was a busy work day for me.

I just wanted to share this experience with you guys, to maybe incite some of you to take that first step towards that crush you've had for a while, you never know what will happen! I'm especially glad that it happened outside of OLD sites and as close to organically as possible in our current world!",[deleted]

dating,qbxxec,2021-10-20 10:40:06,Had my first kiss this Sunday!!! (23M),"UPDATE: SECOND UPDATE COMING UP!!! https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/raw3t4/2nd_update_had_my_first_kiss_this_sunday_23m/


Last Sunday I went on the first date with this girl (22F) I met on Tinder and it ended the best way I could think of.

First things first, I went on 4 dates through my entire life (23M), and 2 of those were in the last month. Those dates were actually really good, but ended up actually into them ghosting me or just them wanting to be just friends and nothing else. Obviously, that crushed my confidence and self-esteem down to the rock bottom (which they were actually down because of my looks and stuff) and after those dates I tended to feel really sad. Also this made me have a big fear of rejection.

What happened now? I‚Äôve met this girl through OLD a month ago, and we started to chat, and last week we decided to meet on Sunday. I tried to convince myself to meet with no expectations, even though I was nervous as sh*t hours before.

On Sunday, we met each other, we went to a caf√© near the place we‚Äôve met at, we spoke about a lot of things, our lives, etc‚Ä¶ After that, we decided to get ourselves a carsharing vehicle, because she wanted to try it for the first time (she lives a bit far from the city I live in). During the whole driving stuff (which lasted 1 hour), we laughed a lot and had a lot of fun. After that, we went to another bar and we continued to speak about our hobbies and all that stuff.

It was time for her to leave because she needed to pick a bus and it was getting late (12:30 AM). We hopped into the subway in order to go to the bus stop. When we arrived, she hugged me and then, I didn‚Äôt know what made me do it, but I asked her:

‚ÄúMay I kiss you?‚Äù

She answered ‚ÄúYeah, of course!‚Äù

And then we went for it. Couldn‚Äôt believe what was happening in that moment. We started making out even though I didn‚Äôt know how to, but she guided me through the process. We made out for a considerable period of time and she smiled when we ended. She hugged me then and I whispered in her ear to please let me know when she arrives to her place. After that I stole from her another kiss before she finally went into the bus lmaooo.

When I was returning home, I had this smile in my face that wouldn‚Äôt disappear at all. All I could think of is ‚ÄúMY FIRST KISS EVER!!!!‚Äù. I finally did it, even though I convinced myself before that I was going to die a kissless virgin. So this is for you guys, don‚Äôt ever let yourselves down if things don‚Äôt go as you want, because when you least expect it, you can find some beautiful surprises coming along.

We planned another date on Friday, and I hope there will be more kisses like this first one.

TL;DR: After 4 unsuccessful dates in my life and 0 romantic/sexual experiences, met this girl on Tinder, chatted, dated, and kissed (and also made out a bit) at the end of the date. My first kiss ever.

P.S.: Oops! Forgot to mention she was really beautiful and an amazing person!!!

P.S. 2: WOW! I'm just mind-blown big time with the huge support and love you guys and girls showed with this!! I Just want to say **thank you so so much to all of you** for your kind words and just I'm letting know too to those who also keep struggling with this situation that sooner or later you'll experience this too, because you absolutely deserve it!!! Oh, and further updates will come soon after the 2nd date, don't worry! ;))))",eyyy congrats! Heres to many more in the future!

Some women are smaller down there and a big d*ck is painful for them. Others actually prefer a bigger d*ck. However, there isn‚Äôt some unrealistic standard for most women.

As long as you communicate, take your time, are able to build tension through foreplay, and are thorough when stimulating her externally, you will be able to please her. Actual intercourse should be viewed as the final act of the play. You should try to get her as close as possible by using your fingers on the outside near the head of the clitoris, your tongue, and paying attention to the other sensitive areas of her body.

Don‚Äôt be ashamed by something that is out of your control. You can be just as magnetic in bed as anyone else.","The largest sexual organ on a woman is her BRAIN. Generally speaking, it all starts there - and if her head isn't ""in the game"" the rest of her won't be, either."
dating,ibiwlx,2020-08-17 17:44:21,Stop blaming astrology / horoscopes for who you are or who you aren't compatible with,"You don't have multiple personality disroder because you're a Gemini.

You don't have a tendency to say hurtful things because you're a Scorpio.

You aren't always acting like a kid because you're a Sagittarious.

You aren't automatically compatible or non-compatible with SIGN X because you are SIGN X or Y.

Seriously, if there are personality traits about you that seem to be getting in the way of making romantic connections, *work on them*. Unless it is quite literally a matter of faith, that is you treat astrology as your religion (because there is no scientific evidence of anything astrology claims about the human condition), and that this belief system is essential for your partner to agree on, you might be missing out on the person of your dreams without ever knowing.

You are not what your horscope says you are, and neither is anyone else. Think about how nonsensical it is to think otherwise. If it were true, *literally everyone's future and romantic success could be known and measured*. We've known about astrology for over 2 millenia, how could we still possibly not have been able to apply this scientifically for the betterment of society? Because it's fake, it's made up, it's another faith-based system to explain things we choose not to see with a rational mind.

You have all the power to change your own behaviour and getting to know someone through conversation and spending time with them. Do it.

Fun edit: though likely sarcastic, of all the comments that tried to guess my sign, none were right :P ","I hate that some dating sites will only let you see people that ""your sign"" is compatible with. But they ignore big factors like yes to children vs no. Yes to relocating vs not willing to relocate. Among all the rest of the things that are important.

dating,mw9jvw,2021-04-22 17:09:50,Thoughts after my first hookup,"I \[19f\] just had my first hookup last night. We rented a hotel room and did the dirty, nothing too complicated. Problem is how I felt afterward.

I tend to get emotionally attached to people pretty quickly. Of course since in my head I consider this a one-and-done sort of deal, I tried my best to be okay with the possibility of never seeing her again. I've been fighting off my emotions ever since and it's one of the hardest things I've had to do. She wasn't anything remarkable or special to me, but the act itself is what's conflicting with me right now. When we finished, we cuddled for a while, and I felt this intense rush of endorphins that made me feel almost connected with the random girl I just fucked. A tear rolled down my face, not only because it felt great but because none of this had anything to do with love. It was supposed to be empty and meaningless, but in my mind it was so much more than that.

We haven't texted each other since. I'm fine with that reality, and I don't really care that this is the last time we'll see each other. As of now I'm just longing for a connection with someone. Not necessarily with her, but with someone else. I want love. I want mutual feelings. I just don't feel worthy of any of that.","As a girl, I go through the same thing, after I have sex with someone I feel more attached to them. However it is very short-lived and over time I realised what was real vs what was momentary and resulting from a shift of chemicals in my brain. I think you have two options; 1) to lay off casual hook ups and focus on finding a more meaningful connection with someone you can be intimate with both sexually and emotionally, or 2) to be more conscious of your feelings and try to recognise between what is real vs what is temporary so that you can make good choices. Good luck!"

I feel deep down that there is supposed to be some kind of teamwork or sense of having a likeminded best friend to go through adulthood with, but nope. It‚Äôs all me, and as I get older it feels more and more off and disconnected, no matter how ""comfortable being alone"" I am and how independent I am. Yes, I like the freedom and the independence and I‚Äôm not complaining and I‚Äôm not codependent, but man, I wouldn‚Äôt mind having a partner to go through this with. At least a pretty face to smooch after a rough day, or to plan trips and fun things with so it‚Äôs not just all about me, me, me all the time. I wouldn‚Äôt mind someone to be on this journey with, to create memories with, big or small. I wouldn‚Äôt mind giving love and support to someone who also wants this.

He has very little relationship experience and I was talking to my friends about this and they all said this would turn them off too. But I can't really figure out why?!

Girls I‚Äôve been casually saying end up cutting me off after this huge blow up about how ‚Äò[I] played with [their] feelings‚Äô and when I ask why they basically say that ‚ÄòBecause you cuddled me ! I hate you!‚Äô . 



After sex, it‚Äôs like, well we‚Äôre already lying here naked and I‚Äôve got nothing but time to kill.

I never get too relationshipy with the conversation nor do I tell them I love them. It‚Äôs usually just them yapping on and on about their lives. If they feel lead on, it‚Äôs completely unintentional and I do feel bad. 


I might just not cuddle after sex anymore to avoid giving girls the wrong idea. I never thought of this way. I just saw it as a time passer.","If this has happened to you 3 times, maybe you should take it as an indicator that your not communicating your POV of the relationship.

As we chatted we found out we had some mutual friends. We had started chatting in the evening so she had to go to bed. But she messaged me again in the morning. We‚Äôve been talking every day since.

We text in the morning and throughout the day and play video games, watch Haunting of Hill House on Netflix, and chat in the evenings. We spend hours video chatting every day often late into the evenings. I‚Äôve never met someone who is such a perfect match.

We have the same beliefs and values, we both value communication and discussion, and we both find each other really considerate and caring. But we also have so much in common! We have similar food tastes, enjoy each other‚Äôs taste in music, both enjoy PC gaming, and cuddles and both of our favorite stores are the dollar store. The most interesting thing is we both share the exact same birthday just 3 years apart (24M) (21F).

We‚Äôve been really open with each other and we‚Äôve been feeling the exact same way about each other. We are each others type and find the other very attractive. Both of us have been feeling like everything has been going really well and we make the other one happy.

We haven‚Äôt seen each other in person yet but we plan on seeing each other on Friday for the first time. We‚Äôre both really excited! I think I found the girl of my dreams.

Building someone up as the girl of your dreams is pretty huge and can often lead to disappointment. Also, many people have flirtatious dialogues or online relationships with several people at once, until they are actually in a committed relationship. A little caution and dialing back expectations can avoid pain and problems. You also don‚Äôt want to scare her off by coming off as clingy or creepy. I hope it works out for you, and I think your chances will be better if you don‚Äôt go overboard."

My ex was a huge coke head (found out after committing) and I am dead against drugs. I asked him to stop for his health, for his finances and for me.

He used to tell me that him snorting coke is exactly the same as me taking antidepressants (insert eye roll here). Also, he would snort coke three nights a week but refused to get the vaccine because he didn't know what was going into his body (insert second eye roll here).

Eventually he just lied and told me he wasn't taking them and took them behind my back instead to stop the arguments.

 I'm a Man and I tried Hooking Up two times, both times it was incredibly bad and I simply did not like it. But it helped me finding out what I want in life and what my Values regarding Sex is. Because I like Sex allot, but only if it's with someone who I have a lot of intimacy with.  That's the first thing, I get judged when I decline to hook up with them and get told to ""grow up and become a man"". Like what? Just because I'm a Man, I can't decline Sex with a Hot Woman? That's stupid. 

In general, when I'm dating I'm looking for Partner with the same Values like I have, I always did and this ended in great Relationships. And for me seeing Sex as something special between two People is a kind of Value. I always was respectful to the Woman I would stop dating because of to many Sex Partner.  You can do whatever you want and I'm not judging you, I would even be friends with you. But I don't want a Partner who just sees it as a fun Activity you can do with Strangers. This Woman are getting mostly extremely defensive and telling me I'm a Sexist when im dumping them. Which is weird, because I think it's a reasonable decision for a Woman to not date any Fuck Boy or a Guy who sleeps around a lot. I don't make a difference here between Men and Woman.

At the End its better for both.",Whoever told you to ‚Äúgrow up and be a man‚Äù is an asshole but the good thing about freedom to choose what you want in a partner is that everyone has it.

Edit 2: wow! Thanks again everyone for all the responses and the awards!

Yesterday, I (27M) got my first kiss after having never gone on a date with anyone until I was 26. She (25F) isn't the first girl I dated, but she's the first girl I've been able to get physically intimate with and to feel my feelings for her being reciprocated back to me.

On Saturday, we had our fourth date together, first we went out to watch a movie, where towards the end I summoned up the courage to put my hand on top of hers (on our previous dates we hugged a lot but that was it) and we interlocked our fingers together after a couple of minutes and stayed that way until the movie was over; then walking out the theater I put my arm around her shoulder and she put hers around my lower back as we walked back to my car. Then we went to my place, had some light drinks and played some games, then watched a movie and she curled herself up into me and I held her like that for the whole movie. Then when I dropped her off at her place at the end of the night, we hugged goodbye and she surprised me with a quick peck on the side of my neck.

Then Sunday (yesterday), we went out on an afternoon hike and holding hands where the trail was wide enough, and we watched the sunset from the top of some cliffs. I had my arm around her shoulders and she then hugged me real close and we held each other like that for a minute, then I let go but held on to her hands to keep her close, told her how much I enjoyed spending time with her, she was looking at me and I just knew that she was waiting for me to kiss her, and so we did!

I had always hoped that my very first kiss would be romantic and I think that is exactly what happened! Then afterwards, when I dropped her off back at her place, got another kiss for goodbye.

Then later last night, she asked me out to get dinner during the week. I know that she wants to keep seeing me and I'm excited about spending more time with her. And this feels so incredible to like someone and to be liked back, and that she's also putting in the effort too :)","A wonderful and romantic story! Good luck, you two!"
dating,c0p5jm,2019-06-14 20:53:20,Just got kissed for the first time in eight years (30M),"Wow.

So earlier this week I met up with someone my age from an online dating website. We walked around town, had dinner and a few drinks together. It seemed to be going well, and she‚Äôs really amazing and beautiful, but being the skinny, insecure nerd that I am (never been in a relationship, never had sex) I had no idea if she liked me romantically or not.

In a random burst of confidence which happens very rarely to me, as we were laughing and talking together near the end of the evening, I out of the blue asked if I could kiss her. She said yes. Before I could process this, she moved up close to me and we made out for a good few minutes.

She was the first person to kiss me since the beginning of 2011, when I was 22. I‚Äôm now 30. No one I had met in the last eight years had made the move on me, and everyone I had asked (which might sound lame to some but I‚Äôve always been cautious) had all gently said no. I started online dating a year and a half ago when I had enough of being alone, but I hadn‚Äôt had much success until now. I didn‚Äôt tell her how long it had been, I just said after she was the first in a long time. To which she smiled, understood, and kissed me even more.

I feel pretty incredible about it still. We both lead busy lives but I hope we find time soon to see each other again. And, whatever happens, I *really* hope it‚Äôs not another eight years until the next time.

What‚Äôs the next step for me, and how can I keep this new-found confidence/self-worth going?","That's awesome to hear! There's no beating that warm feeling you get after making a genuine connection with someone and learning they feel the same.

Good luck!"
dating,u9k0qr,2022-04-22 17:29:48,Was I a creep for grabbing this girl's tit?,"Last night I was out with my friends in a club. I saw a girl that I know for a long time now. She is a few years younger than me and I haven't ever tried anything with her but she is sooo hot... We said hi, smiled and I went back to my table. an hour later I was in front of the club with my friends, we were coming back in and I saw her again at her table now. At that moment I was hella drunk, I gave my jacket to my friend and I started dancing with her. It was all casual until she turned around and pushed her ass against my dick. At that point I was... I was gassed.. Anyways, I was matching her rhythm and was moving my palms over her ass, legs, belly. And then I went a bit higher and I grabbed her tit for a brief second. She continued grinding me for a few more seconds, then turned around and showed me ""no no"" with her finger while laughing. I laughed it off cause I was kinda embarrased. A few moments later, her friend was walking by so she hugged her, started talking to her and I just left to my table.Did I overdo it? was that.. too much? I know I'll see her again somewhere so I don't know if it will be super awkward and if she'll think I'm a creep or should I just chill the f out.

tl;dr I was dancing with this girl in the club, she was pressed against me and I grabbed her tit, was it too much?  


edit: thank you all for the comments, I've read through all of them, but can't comment any more.. As for the advice, I don't think I'll phone her or dm her just yet, but when I see her again, I'll talk to her. And also, for that one comment lmao, I don't need drinks to talk to girls lmao. I just haven't been out for some time and I was having a great time with the boys and it just so happened that she was in the same club",[deleted]

Yet gave this guy who I worked with a chance to take me out after we have been flirting on and off for 8 months. He knows my situation I came from. He knows I have 4 kids and he has seen them before at my job.  He is a single dad with his shit together and a steady job! Yet he has been absolutely amazing.

dating,htb179,2020-07-18 04:59:54,A relationship that is equally good as it is bad isn't worth holding onto.,"For months, I didn't break up with my girlfriend with whom I only fought with more and more as our relationship progressed. I thought that for as many moments she was toxic, there were at least just as many when I really enjoyed her company, so I held on for time being.

But after our relationship ended, I realized the mistake in my thinking. If the good and the bad are about balanced, it only takes the littlest problems to knock that state out of balance. Imagine what will happen when there's a major shakeup. If your relationship is so easily knocked into the negative like mine was, the instability will most likely exhaust the both of you. If you see this kind of future for yourself, don't drag it out, please. It's probably better to break up when an honest discussion is possible, before the relationship crumbles entirely. 

*If you're telling yourself ""it could be worse"", ask yourself whether you're justifying something you normally wouldn't tolerate with someone else.*

That ex of mine refused to listen to me when it mattered. It just goes to prove some good doesn't justify some bad. 
Of course, none of us are perfect. But it's important to find yourself someone with whom your relationship won't be so easily rattled, someone you know you can trust, work with, and communicate with to improve. Make sure you yourself are also that person. 

*Maybe this is an amateur mistake. I just wish I had thought of this earlier, or that I could have thought more clearly while I was dating, or that someone would have told me this.
So I just hope my shared thoughts can prevent at least one person from experiencing the pain that this blunder caused me.*",I'm sorry about your relationship man. But thanks for posting this
dating,ro8xtf,2021-12-25 12:27:08,It's time to stop advocating lying just to avoid hurting someone's feelings,"A recent post on here blew up - it was regarding whether or not a man should be honest to a woman he was seeing about why he was not planning on seeing her again. His reason was that he simply wasn't attracted to her.

Everybody and their grandmother was telling the man not to be honest to her about it, and to tell her some feathered-down BS about why he won't see her anymore.

""Oh, don't hurt her! Just lie to her and say [insert reason here]"".

This advice is incredibly patronizing and unnecessary. This woman is not a child. 

This is coming from a man who has been rejected and laughed at countless times for being too short, too ugly, or for whatever reason. I'd rather know the truth, develop some resilience, and change what is in my control, rather than to be spoonfed some BS to misguide me and make me feel better. 

So please, cut it out.","There's ""I don't think there's a spark here. Sorry. "" and there's ""you're ugly. "" 

One is appropriate. The other is just unkind.  

Edit:  to every single person commenting ""stop lying."" This isn't lying. This is being honest.  

Also, are you, the person they are incompatible with after 1 or 2 dates or a tinder/bumble convo, the best person to deliver criticism? Think about that for a minute. Think about the weight you would give feedback from a date that didn't go well versus say, a friend of over a decade, your trusted therapist or trusted spiritual guide (if that's your jam, some people have guidance convos with a pastor or tarot reader), or just your favorite auntie. You'd hear it better from someone you trust instead of some stranger. Case in point: every commenter not hearing this advice, and people who already pretty much agree with it supporting me and people who don't agree just doubling down bc they don't want to think about the reality that they were probably unkind to someone."

So.... here's an idea. An experiment per se. Here's how it works... If a guy is reading this find a very close female friend you trust who womt put your info out there and give her your Tinder Account. She is in charge. Give her a few months on your account to try and get a date for you. Since most girls know girls they should do well right? Hell to make it more interesting. Offer to give the girl 10 bucks for every date she can set up.

Or if you're a girl reading this. Find a guy friend of yours who is struggling with online dating and offer to get a date for him. This way we can see how difficult it is for it is for the guys to get date granted they do it correctly.

dating,fbq03l,2020-03-01 06:12:07,Absence makes the heart grow fonder,"... it shouldn‚Äôt leave you guessing and worried.

What I‚Äôm saying is that I see so many posts from people who are so damn unsure and worried about the person they‚Äôre dating. They make themselves crazy because they‚Äôre trying to decipher what the other person is thinking or feeling and worried whether or not they‚Äôre into them.

But dating shouldn‚Äôt be like that. You should be sure about what you and the other person want.

And to be honest I used to think that being unsure and self conscious was just part of the game and I‚Äôd be so self conscious about every text I‚Äôd send, every word I‚Äôd say, every action I‚Äôd take.

But the truth is that if you find someone who gets you and wants to be with you, you won‚Äôt have to bend and break to know where you stand with them. I know this isn‚Äôt some sort of groundbreaking epiphany I‚Äôm sharing but I want to share it nonetheless.

Dating should be fun. You shouldn‚Äôt have to overthink every step you take. And simply put you should be able to be yourself and not question every little thing you do or say.

Because in the end... if the person you‚Äôre dating leaves you guessing and worrying when you‚Äôre not actively with them... you should move on from them. 

A person who wants to be with and cares about you will let you know and let you feel it. They‚Äôll build you up and give you the attention you deserve. They‚Äôll answer your texts in a timely manner, they‚Äôll take you out to dates, they‚Äôll make time for you even when they‚Äôre busy, they‚Äôll build you up when you‚Äôre down...

They won‚Äôt leave you on read for hours, they won‚Äôt flake on you, they won‚Äôt be unsure about you, they won‚Äôt make you question their intentions. 

Basically I feel as if we should all listen to ourselves and our own feelings more. How that person makes you feel when you‚Äôre not around them will tell you so much more about how good they are for you than when you‚Äôre with them. 

It‚Äôs not even what *they‚Äôre are doing but so much more what you yourself are feeling*. 

If a person manages to put a smile on your face even though you haven‚Äôt seen them for a few days... that‚Äôs where it‚Äôs at. If they manage to make you feel down and question your own self worth in that time... do yourself a favor and move on.

They‚Äôve all said they were clean and are on the pill/IUD etc so I didn‚Äôt need to worry.

dating,m0309v,2021-03-07 23:57:50,‚ÄúNot even for a cuddle?‚Äù *barf*,"Advice on what NOT to do when a woman clearly is not inviting you into her place after a date:

A few months back, I went on a first date with a guy I met online. He was okay, but I just wasn‚Äôt really interested. At the end of the night, he walked me back to my apartment. I gave him a friendly hug and said thank you and goodnight. He then decided to say, ‚ÄúCan I come up?‚Äù I clearly say, ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù He then decided to say, ‚ÄúNot even for a cuddle?‚Äù 
Now, I probably would‚Äôve gone on a second date with him if it weren‚Äôt for that comment. That was the most cringeworthy thing ever said to me. I just met him that night and he asks for ‚Äúa cuddle‚Äù when I‚Äôm clearly not inviting him inside. *cringe*

The advice I‚Äôm trying to put out there is if a woman clearly isn‚Äôt inviting you into her home, don‚Äôt push it. It‚Äôs rude and it‚Äôs creepy and inconsiderate and may just cost you a second date you‚Äôre hoping for.","Went on an OLD date last weekend. I'm a huge dog lover and have 2 of my own. When he found out they sleep with me he said he'd ""change that,"" because "" dogs belong in barns not beds. "" Later in the date he told me we were going on a second date and I didn't have a choice. Bwahahaha, he must not know 'bout me."
dating,10cwgmg,2023-01-15 22:06:08,Would you be offended if your new romantic interest gently asked you how you felt about getting tested (for std) with them??,"I told this guy something along the lines of ""not to be a nerd or anything but how would you feel about getting tested with me? It would make me feel more comfortable with you, sexually"" I believe I was just being practical esp since this guy complained about wearing condoms ...
He got very upset and defensive and said I offended him and basically ""ruined"" our new relationship by even asking him the question at all because it means I don't trust him. I tried my best to explain that I just wanted to be safe and trust is something that needs to be built, imo, but he kept saying I should trust his word and he never asks anyone to get tested blah blah blah
I was really at a loss bc it just sounds so...unwise to me. I really don't think he needed to take it so personally but I'm curious what other people would say? Is it really a rude thing to ask?","No. I'd actually respect them more, feel a lot safer and be happy we're on the same page because I would 've asked too.

You are doing the right thing, don't let anyone tell you you're wrong for being protective of your safety and health."
dating,yluer6,2022-11-04 09:54:58,What do women taste like?,"I (29f) have been dating a man (34) with no sexual experience. I love giving blowjobs so it has been something I‚Äôve loved doing every time we see each other and he has been loving it. 

Last week for the first time he went down on me (his first time going down on anyone) and after a minute he looked repulsed (it was after a shared shower). 
I asked him if everything is alright and if there is a smell, he said everything is fine and came up with excuses like ‚Äúwe have so much sexual things to explore, we can leave this for the future‚Äù.

I‚Äôve given him multiple blowjobs and he was fine with receiving, but not with giving. After pressuring him for a week to tell me, he finally said that ‚Äúit was just bitter and not what he was expecting‚Äù. I asked for a comparison and he said Br√ºssel sprouts üò≠

I‚Äôve never had a man say something like that before and all my previous partners have loved eating me out. I‚Äôm now self conscious and I‚Äôm scheduling a gynaecologist appointment. He said ‚Äúhe‚Äôs not used to it and it‚Äôs probably an acquired taste‚Äù, but I don‚Äôt feel like letting him go down on me again. What makes it hot giving/receiving oral is seeing that your partner is enjoying it as much as you are.

We broke up 5 months ago over something completely unrelated and it lasted a week. Interesting enough, that‚Äôs when he decided to activate his old ‚Äúhigh school‚Äù tinder, and update it. When we got back together, I found out that he had done that. My friend sent me a screen shot of it and I of course got upset! I don‚Äôt remember what happened but we were good until a few days ago. 

My friend showed me another screenshot of my boyfriend with an updated picture (taken a couple months ago) on the app and I confronted my bf. I accused him of cheating and he started to victimize himself also while claiming that he didn‚Äôt have the app downloaded. He showed me that I wasn‚Äôt installed but idk. I feel like actively pursuing girls on the internet is cheating. And at this point I want him to admit it and stop lying. What do you think??

(Another question, I‚Äôve never used tinder so I was wondering how do I know if an account had been active or not ? I don‚Äôt think it would pop up if someone wasn‚Äôt actively using tinder..)","I broke up with my ex because he was still on tinder and talking to girls while we were dating.

dating,uk5og9,2022-05-07 04:40:58,height differences are overrated,"i don‚Äôt understand women who are on the shorter side and are so adamant about wanting a 6ft+ boyfriend. i‚Äôm. 5‚Äô0 girl and my bf is 6‚Äô2. i didn‚Äôt seek him out for his height, i wouldn‚Äôt care if he were 5‚Äô3.

it just makes sex SO annoying. like he can‚Äôt just bend me over the counter and fuck me because our genitals don‚Äôt line up like that. also if we‚Äôre doing doggy, i have to stick my ass WAYYYYY up in the air and he has to do some weird kneeling stance to fuck me.

during missionary my face is buried in his collarbone. it‚Äôs hard to kiss him during missionary. the only good thing about the height difference is i‚Äôm small and he can pick me up and fuck me while carrying me. but it‚Äôs not a very practical position so we can only go at it for a little bit.

also outside of sex, it‚Äôs awkward to kiss him. i go on my tippy toes and he has to bend down a lot. it‚Äôs only comfortable for a quick peck, nothing more. his long legs also means he walks faster than me. and i‚Äôm at an awkward height to hold hands with him.

don‚Äôt get me wrong, i think he‚Äôs amazing and i wouldn‚Äôt change a thing about him, but all the women going ‚Äúi refuse to date unless he‚Äôs over 6ft!‚Äù maybe rethink that if you‚Äôre under 5‚Äô7

edit: thank you to [this commenter](https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/uk5og9/height_differences_are_overrated/i7nll82/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3) for actually understanding my post

edit 2: people keep thinking i‚Äôm saying you shouldn‚Äôt date tall men as a short woman. no! i‚Äôm specifically talking about women that say ‚Äúhe needs to be 6ft+‚Äù i‚Äôve seen it personally! i‚Äôve talked to women about it and i‚Äôve seen them set their dating app filters or include it in their bio as a requirement. i get it‚Äôs a preference, but i‚Äôm finding it odd that the height difference is being romanticized when really it‚Äôs ‚Ä¶. not that romantic? i feel like it‚Äôs the equivalent of me refusing to date anyone besides blondes. which would be my right! but just odd‚Ä¶ and i‚Äôm expressing my opinion about that.

if your man is perfect and is tall, that‚Äôs obviously great and the height difference is just an annoyance to get used to. but it‚Äôs not the end of the world if the guy isn‚Äôt 6ft

edit 3: my notifications are a mess lmao, so i‚Äôm just gonna talk about some things that are repeated in the comments.

‚Äúyou‚Äôre a hypocrite because you said you like shorter men and you claim height is overrated but your bf is 6‚Äô2!‚Äù sooo i‚Äôve already mentioned i didn‚Äôt pick him because he‚Äôs tall. yes my current partner is tall but i‚Äôve dated shorter men in the past and if things don‚Äôt work out between us, i would be open to dating anyone above 5‚Äô0. people say i‚Äôm lying because of the height of my boyfriend. my boyfriend is also white. if i said i don‚Äôt care about what race my partner is, are people going to just assume i‚Äôm a liar just because my boyfriend‚Äôs white? ‚Äúwell clearly you only care to date white men because your current boyfriend is white!‚Äù it‚Äôs an absurd thing to think.

also noting my preference for men above 5‚Äô0. yes it is a preference and yes i do realize the whole ‚Äúi want a 6ft man‚Äù thing is also a preference. i‚Äôm still gonna criticize it. i‚Äôve got other preferences i‚Äôm sure people would judge me for, but so be it. 

some commenters have explained to me more about their attraction to tall men, so i guess it makes more sense to me, even if i can‚Äôt relate. lots of people said it‚Äôs just an innate attraction, which i get, i‚Äôve definitely felt that about other qualities in men. i still think it‚Äôs shallow to just totally discount someone purely for the fact that they‚Äôre under 6ft, but heyyyy ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è shallowness is subjective i guess.

ok ok last edit: i‚Äôm bored of this thread now it‚Äôs very redundant üòÇ  i‚Äôm not saying a height difference is inherently bad or that short people shouldn‚Äôt date tall people, i just think it‚Äôs weird to hyperfixate on a height difference, but whatever that is my opinion and y‚Äôall are allowed to disagree. some people also think i‚Äôm a liar no matter what and no woman could ever fathom dating short men. also some people are just bitter about women all the time. also the weirdest of all, one individual someone came to the conclusion that i made this post because i wanted to start an OF??? i guess if i‚Äôve learned anything, it‚Äôs the fact that i will never understand some people‚Äôs thought processes.",Lmfao preach the truth!!

I‚Äôve asked her about this and let her know how I‚Äôm unhappy about this,but it just led to arguments. She says hes a good friend and she isnt going to lose a friend over me. I get that. How do I get over this?","Does your gf treat you differently than her guy friend?

I had two exes whose best friends were women. They also often spoke more than we did but they had a career in common whereas my exes and I did not. Tbh I didn't mind it at all because when we spoke about it, they made clear they were just friends so I assumed trust (in the end nothing they did broke that trust either). They also treated me differently than their best friends and would speak openly about me/invite me to hangout with them together. The best friends and I became friends during my relationships with the two exes.

If your gf appears to be more romantic and or feels a bit secretive about talking with him, that's when I think I might be more concerned.

edit: missed the part where you wrote that she texts him after you sleep. that's a bit weird. I would discuss reasonable conditions that would make you feel more comfortable with their friendship, if she cannot compromise then I think that's an indicator that she will not compromise in other areas of your relationship either."
dating,t2rjeo,2022-02-27 16:15:11,New bf want me to straighten my hair to impress his parents,"I am a biracial female who often gets compared to Liza koshy and tia mowery in terms of appearance. And have extremely curly hair. I'm talking curlier than Taylor swift in her country days.

I recently started dating a white  guy for almost five months. He's wonderful and I can see us being together for a while. And he's never had a problem with my curls. In fact he loves playing with them and has said that they are his favorite thing about me in terms of appearance. And I appreciate that because I always felt insecure about my curl because I have been bullied relentlessly for it.

However, he wants me to meet his parents this  Saturday and told me his parents don't take well to POC. He then suggested that I straighten my hair to give me a more of a more....eurocentric appearance. And this broke my heart because he knows that I have been bullied relentlessly for my curls and it's a little disheartening to think my bf's parents might not accept me or think I'm beautiful because of either. And also...my bf knows that the reason why I hardly straighten my hair is because I don't want to damage it. And this man visits his parents every weekend and I'm pretty sure he's going to want me to tag around at least half the time....and straightening my hair each time is not going to be healthy for my hair in the long run. And also...if his parents really are silent racists like he says, I don't think straightening my hair is going to make them like me.

Update 2: he said that he was too excited for the monday date, i told him no kissing, since i'm not ready for any intimacy right now, he simply said ""Come ooooon"" ""what about hugging""(we've been talking for 6 days now lmao). I told him idk since i'll be there for talking and getting to know you, kissing and hugging is not something that requires planning since it's spontanious, he replied saying: ""we'll be talking while hugging"" lmao, also i told him to not get the impression of us dating afterwards since i have 2 months left for my finals and i can't mess up anything for my sake and my family's sake and i don't want to get distracted and always think about the responsibilities that comes with dating especially if it's a serious relationship , he started arguing and told me fine whatever (he's a droppout btw, so he's always free), he  told me ""i'm going to treat you like any casual person in my life then"" and changed my nickname which is funny (he set my nickname into something cringy a day after talking to him so i felt like all of this stuff is being rushed).

Admittedly, I caught feelings a bit too quickly and I always kind of knew that I liked him more than he did me. I had hoped that he would eventually open up to me.

About a month ago, he dumped me out of the blue and I was destroyed. I have been grieving the relationship the past weeks and made a fool of myself trying to get him back on a particularly bad night. I‚Äôve since started to come to terms that he really wasn‚Äôt that special and I was just in a vulnerable place.

I was finally feeling like I was over him over the last few days, so I‚Äôve been going through the process of throwing away anything of his/from him. I often let him borrow my laptop for his schoolwork while we were together, so I was going through and deleting anything of his on there. I stumbled across this folder with my name on it and I have been completely blindsided by what was in it.

There were videos/pictures in there of me giving him blowjobs and us having sex, and I literally had NO IDEA he had ever taken any of these. My FACE is completely visible in some of them. I still can‚Äôt believe it. Who the fuck does that? 

I‚Äôm just so mad. I wasted all this time being upset about not being with him anymore, only to find out what a piece of shit he really is.

dating,oujugu,2021-07-30 12:41:45,Took a big leap of faith and it has worked out,"TLDR at bottom and sorry if formatting is bad this is my first long post on reddit

So I(22M) was in a workshop for one of my Uni classes and got put in a 4 person group with a girl that turned out to be quite nice, I wanted to get her number after class but she left early (Probably wouldn't have managed to do it anyway) I made sure to make a note of her name, so when I got home I looked up the class list on my Uni's site and the only contact method I could find was an email, So what do I do, I take what feels like the biggest leap of faith to this day, I try to keep it short but sweet (I guess)

>**Subject:** Hey, It's B from the workshop  
>  
>**Message:** Hey H it was nice to meet you today, You seem like a pretty cool person, anyway I was just wondering if you would like to grab a drink some time as I would like to get to know you, If that is something you would be interested in feel free to chuck me a text on \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*.  
>  
>Cheers B

Now I sent the email fairly late so I didn't expect to get a response that night but I still end up going to bed thinking what have I done I hope that doesn't come off too creepy

So the morning after rolls round and my phone goes off and to my surprise its H

>Hey B :)  
>  
>Just H here.  
>  
>How are you?  
>  
>Thanks for your email you seem like a cool guy I would love to catch up for a drink or something :)

I send her off a message an hour later and didn't get a response till later in the day, and after that we bounce messages back and forth for the rest of the night, It was great, I felt such a good connection and not a dry moment of texting.

Next day rolls around and we are finalizing the details of the meetup, at this point I am unsure of what sort of a meetup this is so I fire off another leap of faith message

>Umm is this just a normal meet up or is it a date, I'm happy with either just want to get on the same page?

To which she replies ""What would you like it to be?"" I didn't want to come off the wrong way so I was thinking about what to say but before I could reply she wrote back ""Let's just call it a date. :)"", That is absolutely what I was hoping for, We have a bit of a laugh about it and finalize when and were to have the Date(OMG I still can't believe it)

&#x200B;

So now I have to wait till next Wednesday rolls around and I guess if this post gets a bit of traction I can post an update

&#x200B;

TLDR: Sent an email to a girl from Uni as a leap of faith and later another leap of faith to setup a date

Edit 1: Thanks for all the warm words of encouragement I tried to reply to a few people but there is so many comments that I can't think of new thinks to say to you all

dating,t01xt7,2022-02-24 04:37:08,A woman got angry with me when I told her my answer to a hypothetical she proposed. Am I in the wrong?,"This girl, myself, and a few others were talking about sex related stuff yesterday. General, funny, preferences, etc.

The topic of oral came up and we were being funny talking about sizes, smells, etc. It was all in good nature. Someone made a joke about how it‚Äôs only a matter of time before a girl gets cheated on if she doesn‚Äôt give head. Albeit a little crass, it was definitely just a joke and everybody laughed.

However she brought up ‚ÄúWould any of you leave someone if they didn‚Äôt want to give you head?‚Äù All the other guys in the group said no, but I said yes and I meant it. She then started asking me these scenarios like ‚Äúwould you leave even if it was because head grossed her out/what if she has trauma from it?‚Äù To which I still said yes.

I could tell she was starting to get a little heated and she said ‚Äúit‚Äôs crazy to me that a sex act is a deal breaker.‚Äù And then started saying things like ‚Äúoh you like anal Blakakke69? Well I don‚Äôt so we should stop seeing each other even though we really like each other because I don‚Äôt want to take it in the ass.‚Äù Sort of mocking my point of view.

To which I said ‚ÄúI would never go that deep into a relationship without figuring out what is off the table as far as sex goes so your point isn‚Äôt valid.‚Äù

I also said ‚ÄúWhat does it matter if the deal breaker is something you don‚Äôt agree with? It‚Äôs not yours to worry about. Some people only date tall, some people only date curvy, I only date someone who‚Äôs willing to give head. If they‚Äôre not willing to give it, I move along. Simple. I‚Äôm not saying they have to suck me off every day against their will. It just can‚Äôt be off the table. Why would I want to date someone who doesn‚Äôt want to do something I really enjoy sexually and vice versa? Also you‚Äôre not dating me so why are you getting mad?‚Äù

To which she responded ‚ÄúThen you should tell people that upfront on the first date.‚Äù

I retorted ‚ÄúIf it comes up in a deal breaker convo I do tell them. You‚Äôre getting really heated over a hypothetical.‚Äù

She didn‚Äôt like that and just dropped it. She was kind of checked out for the rest of the convo.

Granted I probably could have handled that better, but come on.

It would be like if a girl loved pegging. If I‚Äôm not into it and it‚Äôs her favorite thing to do and she‚Äôs not willing to not do it, we see other people. It would be wrong for her to insist I do it for her even when I told her no, and it would be wrong for me to expect her to curb her kink just for me.

People have dating preferences. I don‚Äôt understand why I‚Äôm the bad guy for mine.

Am I just an asshole?

EDIT: Apparently I wasn‚Äôt clear on the relationship between us. We have not dated and agreed that we shouldn‚Äôt date months before this convo took place. We are part of the same social group and I would consider us somewhere between friends and acquaintances",She was definitely triggered by what you said. But I don't think you were wrong in fact it's better to find someone who enjoys it already then to pester someone into doing it.
dating,gwaj6l,2020-06-04 04:52:11,Just remember: it isn‚Äôt fair to compare your connection with someone you met recently to someone you know very well,"When I think about meeting new people and they seem boring, I realize I am comparing all the best parts of my former relationship. How can someone I just met, who I barely know or am just getting to know, compare to someone I built a former deep and meaningful relationship with? 

It‚Äôs not realistic to expect that right off the bat. It‚Äôs easy to hold your ex to a high standard and feel as though no one else will hold up to them, but it‚Äôs unrealistic to compare a connection that formed over time and a connection just beginning to develop. I felt like they knew me better than anyone else. That came from spending a LOT of time together. I can‚Äôt expect to feel seen and known from people who Ive barely given the chance to get to know me. Comparing, and looking for that instant connection, is not always representative of what your relationship could be. 

I have to constantly keep reminding myself of this. You‚Äôll meet someone else who blows that person out of the water. Very rarely is a real connection formed so instantly.

dating,11nu1du,2023-03-10 16:41:50,"""WhY Do AlL GuYs"" Just stop yourself right there, please","This sub has an annoying and slightly gross habit of making things out to be like the last thing someone experienced with a partner is a universal thing with the entire four billion people of that gender they dated.

Recently we've had such bangers such as (paraphrasing) Tell me there are guys out there who don't cheat, why is it hard for guys to say they're not interested instead of ghost, many on people not wanting to find a long term relationship, when many of us are on either isle.

For one, rates of cheating are much closer than you'd expect (had to remove recent survey links due to automod), which a reasonable person could have assumed would happen with empowerment + opportunity, this is a human constant regardless of race or gender or any other divider, but in both cases it's a significant minority, *most men and most women do not cheat* still. Many of my friends have been devastated by cheating, many men and women on here have been, it's not specifically gendered.

All of the rest is also things we both experience. I've been hurt by seeing someone for 7 months before and after having a chat about getting a bit more consistent and serious, was hard ghosted after she was enthusiastically saying yes in person. Shit sucks. It wasn't a guy lol, because both genders do that plenty.

Please leave the gender warring on the elementary school playground where it belongs, I'd like to believe a significant minority of people may be shit, but the majority are good, and even the worst stats on cheaters bear that out. Ghosting is just a problem of our times with modern dating apps, and almost all of this other stuff I've seen brought up as a gender specific thing I've either experienced myself from another partner or my friends have. 
 
Just understand a lot of this is universal, it'll even help you feel better and move on.","I'm getting sick of the ""Does \[x gender\] like it when \[y event/action\]?""

The answer is always ""sometimes."" Some guys like it when you approach them, some don't. Some women expect the man to pay for the meal, some don't."
dating,dw0zq1,2019-11-14 00:10:00,Let's stop with the victim mentality in dating,"I have been going on way more dates as a 25 Y/O woman and I've gained way more lessons and experiences in the last year than I did in all the 7 years before when I started dating guys. Something I've realized is that there seems to be a normalized victim mentality when it comes to dating and I think we need to collectively challenge  this. On this sub I see lots of posts about ""I hate being dragged along"" ""If you don't like me romantically LET ME KNOW so I can move on"" etc and all these posts basically enforce the idea that the power always has to lie in your romantic interest and not in you. Well I realized something recently: Our sole responsibility as individuals is to take care of ourselves and be happy period. It's not to figure out why our partner is withdrawing from us especially if they won't communicate like adults, whether they're interested, whether they're not. In dating situations I've found myself asking more about How they make me feel and whether I like it instead of whether I'm good enough for them and it's been life changing. When I was younger I would pine and wonder about a guy's interest now I only go for guys who are full on after me If I have to guess I'm out. I approach my life in general with an abundance mentality and I've noticed I'm getting more positive male attention this way. I always make it clear what I want and how I want to be treated. If I notice things are changing I ask about it once. After that I dip tf out and move on to the next or stay single, they can explain when they want but I'm out at that point. Don't accept long response times, late night only convos, disrespect, lack of clarity, feeling led on. This is the only soul and body you'll ever have. Why are you allowing anyone to do you the disservice of guessing and pining because they are not brave enough to let you go and are choosing to ghost? Take your power back, let yourself go.

EDIT: This post is not encouraging ""selfishness"" or ""callousness"". It's about integrity and self respect. If you know what's makes you happy then that's is what you should go after. I'm not saying ""Walk away from anything as soon as a little problem arises"". I'm saying notice it, communicate with your partner and both of you meet each other in a good middle. If they cannot work with you then with self respect, walk away. 

TL/DR: If a situation is not enriching you, bounce without pining for closure from the outside.","In a sense its the Reddit problem. Reddit is not a reality. Its where we go to meta-discuss reality. Ruminating over every interaction with someone to the Reddit level creates the victim mentality because you are mentally over invested. So nothing they do is going to ever measure up because on day two when you have texted for two hours, they have invested two hours but the Redditor has invested nine hours discussing those two hours on Reddit...


If you are psycho-analyzing every text and unsure about everything, you come to Reddit and you get feedback. You then further ruminate on the feedback. Then you act on the feedback in the real world. You act needy or you question the relationship, then the relationship ends.

You: ""Hah! I knew Reddit was right as always, he was totally not in to me and just leading me along...""

Or they were just weirded the fuck out by the amount of Olympic level mental gymnastics going on to psychoanalyze every little thing just to have long Reddit threads filled with confirmation bias."

dating,lj60n4,2021-02-13 18:25:06,"Online dating sucks, but you're mad at the wrong component.","Hi, I am 2 weeks from 40, divorced and I hate online dating. 

Guys, I know that you're all thinking I'm going to say it's because of the women... I'm not here to say that it's because women are hyperselective, because I date everyone. Men are also to blame for being by and large disgusting to people online and lonely men are definitely more likely to come off as hypersexual. I'm a bisexual. I am on all the platforms, and I'm cautiously looking for in person companionship that will eventually lead to a relationship. I can 100% confirm that I've never met anyone from tinder who wasn't a platonic friend already who mercy-swiped me. It's hard out there if you don't have the perfect profile, abs, or whatever signal that triggers available ladies to swipe right.

Ladies, I do also see that hyperselectivity. I don't get matches because I'm not skinny, and suddenly people are not interested in spending time with me because ""high energy 40 year old"" scares off lazy sedentary 40 year olds (most) and younger people freak out about the age thinking that I can't keep up. I totally understand what most dudes are like online.. I know why. 8 out of 10 conversations I've had on grinder ask for or sends dick pics, or ask I have drugs (meth, coke and poppers are top 3 it seems), and the other 2 were bots spamming membership dating sites. So yes guys, I can confirm what the ladies are saying. It does seem like most dudes on internet dating treat other people like stupid fuckmeat and do not bother using manners. It is gross, I've deleted my Grindr profile for what might be the last time now that tinder has a show me everyone option.

A little sidebar here... if you think AFAB women are hyperselective, try to get a date with a transwoman... most seem to be so much more defensive due to the very real risk of bigotry or violence that it is VERY VERY hard to even get a message back. There's a whole other world of unspoken rules and triggers that will get you ghosted faster than anything, and you are expected to mindread your way past that. Transgirls, you do your gatekeeping, I understand why.

So I have a theory that physical isolation and the internet is making the majority of people into assholes.  Take for example this subreddit where we unload the sum of our experiences onto strangers, seeking a place to vent, and often get even worse experiences in return in the comments. People seem to be forgetting the most common rule of reddit, ""don't forget the person"". I think the worst part of having to wear a mask every day is that I had to break my 4 year streak of smiling at a stranger in public every day. I have started to realize that social isolation is making me lonely and bitter. 

In my experience, all people these days (especially on the internet) don't care to understand or apologize to a person they hurt, they prefer to instead justify their actions and walk away. I guess that has to be good enough for everyone else. Sorry if I offended you, or called you out here, I am just trying to think of what I can do to make my immediate surroundings better.

TLDR be nicer, it's you, and it's everyone else, but you can only change you. Let's start a trend of being nicer.

EDIT: Thanks for the awards and kind words!",If I went to bars(even before the pandemic) I would have hoped to meet you and have a drink. Like a wise sage who's been through it all.

dating,13egxf2,2023-05-11 08:17:17,I feel so touch deprived,"I (21F) don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just me but I feel like i‚Äôm so touch deprived. I want someone to hold me and tell me they actually care about me, like I would literally do anything to feel that. 

I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because of my past with emotionally unavailable men or nonchalant men who didn‚Äôt bother to touch me unless it was for sex. It seems as if every guy i‚Äôve talked to has never gave me a hug without trying to feel up on me or kiss me lovingly ‚Äî instead of trying to do it just to turn me on. 

I know people are going to say ‚Äúoh get a massage‚Äù or ‚Äúrub your own arm‚Äù like that has not worked at all to make me feel better. it makes me so jealous and envious when i see other couples who are openly affectionate; i understand yes, my time would come but it can just be so hard. hugging stuffed animalsand using weighted blankets can only do so much for a girl lol. 

 i‚Äôve been turned off by going on dating apps or replying to thirsty men replying to my instagram stories because i am not interested in men wanting to have one night stands with me or be friends with benefits because i want genuine emotions.

I of course love sex but I want raw emotion and love.

I want hugs, I want a girl that expresses her affection towards me, to tell me that I matter, etc. I want someone who won't mind me being affectionate towards them. It doesn't help seeing couples in public being affectionate towards each other as well. I have yet to experience dating and being in a relationship. 

I get that there's more to a relationship than just physical touch, but on some days, it's all I want. But, if anything, I've been trying to accept the fact that I shouldn't be dating anytime soon, as there's so much I have to work on before I can even think of dating. It is what it is."

dating,wdishv,2022-08-01 14:25:35,Something that Everyone Needs to hear at some point,"I've heard the same story a lot here, ""I workout, I have a good job, my life is going well, but I can't get into a relationship. What am I doing wrong?"", and the answer might very well be nothing.

The thing that people don't think about, is that dating requires you to be lucky. You need to be at the right place at the right time to find someone who you like and who also likes you and both of you are single and want to be in a relationship together.

That's not a common thing for most people that happens everyday. The common advice people will give is one of two things, either work on yourself, or work on meeting new people. Neither of these things are bad advice. But what you have to realize whether you decide to work on yourself or work on meeting new people is that this isn't the way to get into a relationship, this is the way to increase the odds that you'll get into a relationship. What does that even mean? Well, I think an analogy is an order.

I like poker. Doesn't matter if you like or have ever played poker. But poker is a game of playing the odds. It's a game about putting yourself in the best position to make money. But it's also a game of playing the people who you're playing with. You have to understand your luck, and the people you play with. And while playing poker, if you play consistently, there's the well-understood notion that no matter how well you play the odds, there will be times, maybe even a string of times where you lose. Things go wrong, and when there's something on the line (money, pride, feelings, opportunities), that's going to hurt. 

No matter how well you play the game, in any facet of life where there's luck involved, whether it's getting a job, getting into college, or getting a date, if there's any variance in the outcomes (i.e. luck), then no matter how well you think you are, there is a chance you'll fall flat on your face. So, comes the saying, luck wins the day, skill wins the year.

You have to ride out your bad luck. If you truly are doing everything right. You're working on yourself, you're meeting new people, you're trying your best, then you don't need to worry. In the end of the day, finding someone who you're compatible with is luck. And all you can do is increase the odds. And if you're happy with your current state of dating, but you haven't found anyone, then don't blame yourself. 

Patience is key. Because no matter how lucky other people are, that's not your luck. You have to keep playing the game until you get lucky. Because luck wins the day, but the best win the year. 

Good luck to all of you.","I agree with this completely. Earlier in the year, I was taking a break from dating to focus on me as dating became a chore over time. One day I decided to download Tinder and matched with a pretty cool lady who become my girlfriend (and later ex). She had just recently moved to the area and jumped on Tinder the day before I did. All of the star aligned for us to be in the same area, downloaded Tinder within a day of each other, and then matching with each other. We had insane chemistry but unfortunately were not compatible. Still crazy to think about the circumstances and how we could have very easily never met."

It sounds so corny. I think people that are only looking for hookups are shallow who have a hard time being open with themselves and others, I say this because I have seen and heard this for myself from  guys that they have trust issues.

It‚Äôs hard to find someone on dating apps, even in real life who actually has a personality to them outside of having sex with anyone they just can. I am not satisfied nor okay with being perceived as somebody who will give just give up their body and them self in exchange for nothing.

I am not saying you cannot have intercourse with someone you‚Äôre not in a relationship with but I do not like the idea of having sex with someone if there is no romantic or emotional connection, it would feel extremely superficial and as if I am giving up everything on the spot. I know that I am a human who is unique and has beauty not only on the outside but within for someone to discover and bond with.

There is no such thing as ""playing hard to get"" anymore.

This is not to say or imply that you should become ONE of these people. NO! Don't do that... because if you let this happen, then all you will do is decrease or diminish the quality of your OWN character. All I'm saying is you must REFUSE to chase after people who mislead, play games, never call/text or return calls and texts or disrespect you no matter HOW good they look or WHAT they can do in bed! These kind of people will use their looks, sexual abilities and the size of whatever is in their underwear or bra to use, take advantage or hurt others... and none of these things are worth you pride and self-respect.

She giggled a d said yes. I'm from Boston so I was joking and said i know what you mean I have a small crush on Tom Brady. I also mentioned before that I like to listen to Adele when I do cardio. I'm like running away from. Sadness. Anyways date went good but after she said she doesn't see this going any where. Okay cool. Part of dating. Now she messages me saying she thought I was too feminine because of the Tom Brady Adele comment. But her friend said it just meant I was secure in myself. She was like I would like to see you again now. Like it's a honor to see her. I said no thanks. Lol I'm not into that stupid insecure macho tough guy shit. I killed people in war with my bare hands. I don't give a shit about looking tough. If you don't like Adele you are lying.,"Maybe you should date her friend who doesn't get all panicky about whether her man is too ""feminine"" or not instead"
dating,dc850o,2019-10-02 10:06:12,Is there anyone who still hopes to grow old with someone?,"Recently, I‚Äôve been seeing more and more posts about the pressures of staying in a monogamic relationship and how we all should just love and accept that love may end someday. But I have trouble reconciling with this thought because I truly want to grow old with someone and just one person alone. I don‚Äôt want multiple loves. I want at least one real thing. And if I find that one real thing, I want to do the best I can to cultivate, nourish, and keep that relationship alive. 

Am I the only who feels this way? Just wanted to see if there are still people who are looking for the same thing as I am.


EDIT: Wow, I didn‚Äôt expect this to blow up, but it‚Äôs so great to see that I‚Äôm not alone in this. It‚Äôs encouraging to see that there are still a lot of us who want this out there. Hoping for the best for all of us!","I think you'll find that there are many people out there who still desire to be in a monogamous relationship throughout their life. I've only been with my girlfriend for a year and a half but I hope we're together until we're old, blind, and arthritic (hey babe, if she happens to be reading this)

Having said that, I'd advise you go into any new relationship not expecting it to be your last/one true love or anything like that. And then you can always be pleasantly surprised.

Good luck!"
dating,r8xfm6,2021-12-04 19:44:30,My partner is too loud in bed.," I (26M) recently became FWB with a girl (22F). The sex is incredible and we have an amazing time when we get together. She also feels the same way. The thing is, she is very loud in bed and doesn‚Äôt have any restraints about that.   

The past week we had sex two times and both times she was moaning and groaning like we were on another planet and there was no one nearby. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I find it extremely hot. But my neighbors don‚Äôt. My building has very thin walls and I know that my neighbors can definitely hear us. The first time this happened, my neighbor politely told me to keep it down. And that‚Äôs just my neighbor in the adjacent apartment. I‚Äôm pretty sure with the way she was moaning that the apartments above and below mine could hear us as well. Although I have been lucky enough not to bump into the people living in those apartments, I would rather that they not be disturbed. The second time, during the first round of sex, I gently told her to keep it down. During Doggy, she pushed her face into the pillow and that seemed to work for the time being. But then during the subsequent rounds, she told me that she was not going to bother with restraining herself. She told me that she was gonna enjoy herself to the fullest and my neighbors can go to hell. It was mid-coitus and I was thinking with my penis, so I said okay. Then we continued with our sex and I‚Äôm pretty sure the entire street heard her moans. I also know that after we both finished, I could hear my neighbor open the door and go out. I‚Äôm afraid he had enough of the noise and had to step out.  

What can I do to let her know that while I love her moaning, I don't want to disturb my neighbors? I like my neighbor and he tries to keep it down while playing music or having friends over so that he doesn't disturb me. I‚Äôm just trying to return the favor. But I‚Äôm afraid if I tell her once more, she might think that I‚Äôm telling her not to enjoy sex or that I don‚Äôt find her moans sexy. It seems like right now the only option is soundproofing my bedroom :)  

Any advice?


Edit:
We're both not into choking or gagging. The closest is when I feel like she is getting close to finishing or simply getting too loud, I put her in missionary and french kiss her. She keeps moaning in my mouth but atleast the sounds are lower.

Also, we can't do it at her place due to many reasons which I'm not getting into on Reddit.

Edit 2:
But maybe I exaggerated her intent when she said ""Fuck your neighbors"". It wasn't like fuck them, I hope they are disturbed by us. It was more like fuck them, let's just have fun. She said it more in a playful way, rather than a serious way.",Just tell her she is being too loud and it‚Äôs impolite to your neighbors. If she doesn‚Äôt get that it says a lot about her tbh.
dating,sd7o40,2022-01-26 14:49:59,Ghosted after incredible first date,"Just looking for some advice, cant really find it elsewhere. I went on an incredible first date on friday with 23f (me 25M), and confused as to what is going on now, Wednesday. I met her on a dating app and after a few exchanges we agreed to drinks at 730 friday. I meet her and we end up clicking in every facet, conversation flowing, laughing, and we even kissed sitting at the table bc of the already built sexual tension. I decide to invite her out with my friends and I for the night, and we literally cannot keep our hands off each other the entire night. Even my friends were amazed at how well she was hanging. We end up having an amazing night, and I take her home at about 3am. We hang at her apt for awhile and decide not to have s\*x bc of our strong feelings for each other and not wanting to rush things too much. Before leaving she even mentioned that it was the best first date shes been on and could not wait to see me again. The standard thank you text the next day and I decided to text her to make plans on monday bc she wanted to go on another date this week. No response. I know shes active on her phone bc we exchanged igs and she posted to her story since then. Not really sure what to do now because I dont want to be overbearing but I have never connected with someone like we did. I was super excited to see her again, and I feel like I have to write her again. I cant leave this being ghosted, and just looking for some advice in how to proceed. Any ideas on what I should text her?

&#x200B;

TLDR: Amazing first date, reciprocated mutual feelings for each other, planned for another date and then ghosted.","Oh my god some of the advice on here is terrible!

OP chill. It's only been 2 days. Sometimes life gets in the way of people responding to texts immediately. Maybe she's having a busy week, maybe she's had a personal emergency. Bottom line is, people have lives outside of first dates. Don't blow her off yet, just wait. And I don't mean wait and stare at your phone, I mean just carry on living your life! Go to work, see your friends, go in another date. If she gets in touch - great! If she hasn't got in touch by next week send her a message. Make it a nice one without making any assumptions though - something along the lines of ""Hey, just checking in as I haven't heard from you. I hadba great time and would love to see you again. Are you free this week?"". If she still doesn't respond, leave it. If she says she's no longer interested, respect that.

If you follow some of the advice on here you could end up blowing a good thing before you've even given it a chance!"
dating,humnnd,2020-07-20 14:54:32,Why is it the guy who always has to make the first move?,"I see it everywhere in tv and movies, girls are told to be subtle about their feelings and wait for the guy to make the first move, I don‚Äôt get that. I can‚Äôt speak for other guys but I‚Äôm probably going to misread your signals (romantic, platonic, or otherwise) and if a girl asked me out I would most likely say yes. I‚Äôve asked a lot of girls out so I know how much courage it takes to do it and how bad can feel to be rejected, so I‚Äôd at least give you a chance. I‚Äôm not gonna freak out because guys aren‚Äôt supposed to be asked out by girls. If you like a guy just let them know, don‚Äôt just discreetly drop hints because unless that guy also likes you he‚Äôll will probably misinterpret your hints and start dating or going after someone else, trust me I speak from personal experience","I am not saying I like the status quo, but guys who sit back and wait for women to make the first move will be buried under an avalanche of other guys who are clamoring to make the first move.

dating,bm84zl,2019-05-08 17:30:45,"A Handy Guide on How to Ask a Girl Out, Yet Save Face for Both of You If She Isn‚Äôt Interested","When a girl says that she's too busy to hang out with you, have you ever wondered whether she's uninterested in you or actually busy that week with psets and exams? Based on extensive research, interviews with my fellow female friends, and personal experience (I'm a girl), I have determined a 100% foolproof way to tell. Ready to hear the secret? Here it is: she is interested but actually busy IF AND ONLY IF she tells you that she's busy *but suggests an alternate day to hang out with you*. Otherwise, if she just leaves her response as a simple ""Sorry, I'm busy"" without a follow-up, she's not interested!

Even worse is when she gives you the second response but you then ask her, ""So when are you free?"" This puts her in an extremely uncomfortable situation because it doesn't give her the option to decline unless she says something like ""Oh sorry, I'm never free,"" which she obviously would want to avoid because it's impolite. So then she panics and says, ‚Äúuhh, I‚Äôm not sure,‚Äù to avoid explicitly telling you that she doesn‚Äôt want to hang out with you, ever. And you are bewildered by her response and think that women are confusing.

To summarize, here is A Handy Guide on How to Ask a Girl Out, Yet Save Face for Both of You If She Isn‚Äôt Interested:

Ask the girl the following: ‚ÄúHey, I was wondering if you‚Äôd be free this ______ at ___ pm to get dinner with me?‚Äù Be extremely specific! Don‚Äôt say, ‚ÄúAre you free in the next decade?‚Äù or worse yet, ‚ÄúWhen are you free?‚Äù. It‚Äôs much better to say, ‚ÄúAre you free this Saturday at 6:30pm?‚Äù.

Option A: She says some variation of ‚Äúyes‚Äù. Wow, that was easy!

Option B: She says, ‚ÄúSorry, I have five psets and two exams that week, but how about _____? Does that work for you?‚Äù Congratulations, she was actually busy but is interested in you! You also gave her the option to decide on a date that works for her, you gentleman you!

Option C: She says, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a bit busy then. Sorry, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be able to make it.‚Äù Oof, sorry my dude, she wasn‚Äôt into you. Do not, under any circumstances, suggest another day. This is because if she was truly interested, SHE‚ÄôD suggest another date. Wish her the best with her work and go your separate ways.

For everyone out there who‚Äôs afraid of rejection (ie, everyone), this is the perfect method, because by suggesting a very specific date and time, there‚Äôs a huge chance that she will actually be busy. This means that her response of, ‚ÄúSorry, I‚Äôm busy‚Äù will be genuine, but now it gives HER the power to decide on a further course of action. Essentially, you‚Äôve turned the tables and now *she‚Äôs* the one asking *you* out! Thus, if she suggests another time, congratulations, a girl just asked you out on a date! If she doesn‚Äôt, that‚Äôs equivalent to her never having asked you out in the first place, so everything has stayed the same and you have lost nothing.

I hope this helped, and good luck!",From my experience there are a lot of busy women out there but didn't take me too long to realize that they are busy waiting for other men.

Basically me and this girl have gone on about 6 dates, weve cuddled / made out but havent had sex yet. She planned this weekend to nyc pretty enthusiastically, and we made the plans to go. We were facetiming and she made sure to specify we were getting separate beds. I asked why not 1 and she just shrugged. 

I obviously cant argue if thats what she wants,  but I kinda feel like im getting slowly friendzoned, shes stopped flirting in texts and just talking about the places and food we could go to.

dating,10dzwua,2023-01-17 02:12:22,I adopted a disabled cat and my girlfriend doesn't like her,"For the record, I(30M) asked my gf(28F) a couple of days before adopting the cat. We aren't living together yet but we were planning to, soon. She said sure, it would be great. So this morning I went to the shelter to take a look and see who to bring home, and I found a three legged cat. She also has some scars from her time on the street. I asked the staff about her and they told me she is getting put down tomorrow if no one adopts her. No terminal/chronic illnesses, they just didn't have enough space. I quickly told them I want her and filled out the form, and took her home.

Now my gf is berating me for picking a 'damaged' cat and insisting I replace her, even though I told her that they will kill the cat if I take her back. Do I have any hope of persuading her to see past her appearance or should I just break up now? I'll break up with her if I have to but I'm not going to abandon kitty.

UPDATE : I will break up with her when she gets off work in an hour.

UPDATE : She and I sat down and we talked about it. She said that the cat isn't cute and told me she still thinks I should take her back and get an adorable one. I told her that she's the one who told me to go pick a cat. She admitted she was lazy and didn't want to look around and go through the adoption process. She said she didn't think I'd pick an ugly one. I asked her if she's really okay with them euthanising this cat when she's safe right now and she said yes, just get a kitten. I told her I can't take her back to get killed so we broke up.","Don‚Äôt lose a limb or get any injuries, or your gf will replace you too

Edit: not only does she dislike the cat cus it‚Äôs missing a leg, and has scars but she knowingly has no issues sending her back to be put down. There‚Äôs a clear difference of someone being an actual animal lover vs just loving animals as long as they are cute."

I also swipe left on the profiles that say ‚ÄúIf your height starts with 5, swipe left‚Äù or if they allude to anything about height or income. 

Am I alone in this?","While I was dating, if a profile would waste its bio on ‚Äúno ACB‚Äù or ‚ÄúXYZ only,‚Äù that profile wasn‚Äôt worth my time. I would only swipe on profiles that said something about the person such as their interests, hobbies, goals, even just their sense of humor.

dating,oph526,2021-07-22 16:16:21,"Reasons women say no to a second date after a ""good"" first one","1. Gross teeth/bad breath


Please fellas, use mints/gum. And brush your teeth before a date. Plaque is nasty and if your date notices she is not going to want to kiss you. Teeth whitening kits are $30 at most supermarkets.... If you need one, use one. 


2. Clothes


Wear CLEAN clothes that fit well.  Wear Nice pants or shorts ( no basketball shorts or cargo shorts on a first date). You're trying to make a good first impression. No holes unless the clothing is made that way, and absolutely no stains . And fellas, if your date is at 6 p.m. do not come wearing the same shirt you put on at 6a.m. Even if you're a clean and hygienic guy, it's not going to smell like downy anymore and she's going to think you have B.O. Bonus points if you're wearing something that isn't in your OLD pics. 


3. Shit talking how hard dating is. 


Don't complain about OLD apps, the women you've met on them, or your other exes. It comes across as bitter AF and misogynistic. 


4. Negativity


If you spend most of the date complaining about your job, your family, your dating past, your friends, the pandemic, etc... It's going to be a major turn off. Very few women want to date or fuck someone that they feel sorry for. Save all your drama and bullshit for your therapist, close friends, or for future dates when you've built an emotional connection

5. Being too complimentary. 


You don't need to shower your date with compliments the entire time. If you do, it comes across cheesy and disingenuous.


6. Getting too deep too fast. 


Don't ask about her biggest regrets, sexual history,  break ups, ten year plan, etc. Avoid topics like religion and politics. Don't mention money at all. 


7. Getting too invested. 


Just enjoy the moment.. the only plans you should discuss on the first date, are the plans for the second date (and honestly I wouldn't even do that. So many times I see posts where OP is confused about why she would agree to a second date during the first and then ghost/cancel. Truth is most of those times she just agreed because you were in front of her when she asked  it's just super weird and awkward to reject a total stranger to their face on a date). Even if you're joking, do not talk about future dates, holidays together, vacations, and God forbid what your kids would look like or what you'd want to name them. 


8. Being too sexual or touchy feely


Fellas, I see this topic thrown around and discussed a lot on dating subreddits. It is 100% better to not physical enough than to be too physical. I've never said no to a second date because the guy wasn't physical or didn't go for a kiss, but I have said no because he acted in the opposite way (and I fucking love sex and have a high sex drive). Truth is, too many guys only want sex and even if you are not one of those guys, if you lead with that she's just going to assume that you are.


9. Making it too long/Trying too hard


Fellas, keep it short, sweet, and casual. Leave her wanting more! She shouldn't think that she knows your entire life story after the first date, and if she does, she might not be in a huge rush to see you and learn more. Don't plan a date that will last hours and don't take her to a fancy expensive restaurant. Meet for a couple rounds of drinks, one cup of coffee, play one game of bowling. 
And lastly...


10. It wasn't fun


Make it fun and light hearted!  You are on a first date, not trying to determine if she's going to be your wife and the mother of your kids. Have fun and try to make sure she has fun. Don't ask the same generic interview type questions we all get tired of. Even if we generally got along and had things in common, if I go home after a date and it was boring I'm not going to be in a rush to see the guy again.","12. Stay off your phone! Your date should be the priority and focus of your attention. If you can‚Äôt keep off your phone for a little while, there‚Äôs no chance at a second one."

Only found out today that he has a new girlfriend. 

   I'm more pissed off that he didn't have the respect to message me to say he wasn't feeling it instead of just ignoring me while being with some else. It makes me feel like was our date just for him to have his first date in a while before he started a new course. I'm I right to feel pissed off and a little played by his behaviour?","How close of friends are you guys?  If you've been friends for 4 years and flirty for 2, and he only just asked you out during a pandemic, I'd be skeptical of just how interested he was.

I told her the risk is low for vaccinated people and I want to enjoy normal life for a bit. She told me not to trust the CDC too much. Later we went to get some ice cream. 

That night she told me it's not going to work out because even after she told me her concerns about Covid I still didn't wear a mask when I went to get ice cream. She said it's hard to have a peace of mind with me if I'm this careless, and we are done.

So what lessons can I learn from this?",The lesson you can learn is that you are not compatible. I don't mean that to sound harsh; I've simply found that disagreeing over issues a person feels strongly about - especially this early in the relationship - is a sign that it isn't meant to be. I hope you aren't taking it personally. If you were able to get a second date she obviously thought you were cool. You just have different opinions.

dating,ndh3oe,2021-05-16 05:13:09,"Well, my date went AWESOME!","(Skip to paragraph 6 if you've seen this topic before)

I (18M) work part-time as an elementary school librarian. For the past almost 2 weeks now, there's been a new girl in town, about my age, doing volunteer work at the school. AFAIK, she just goes around looking for people who need help and doing things with them, which is basically what I did the first few weeks I worked there.

One day she came in and asked if I needed any help while I didn't have a class visiting, and I just let her hang out and talk story for like half an hour. We hit it off pretty good, and now she comes and hangs out with me almost every day.

Let me tell you, she's been nice to have around. She's always got a pretty smile on her face and seems to like hanging around me. Plus, we have a lot of common interests,  so there's plenty for us to talk about. And to top it all off, she's really pretty, and she has the cutest smile when I'm around her.

There's also been a couple days where I've come in and found a bowl of chocolate chip cookies with a card from her with hearts on it on my desk. I just think that's sweet.

Anyway, I'd been crushing on her for a while, so on Wednesday, I asked her if she wanted to go out on a date this Saturday, and she said yes! Well, I just got back from it, and let me tell you... it went AWESOME.

I left the house around 12:00pm and went over to go pick her up from her place in my Saab convertible lowrider (top's busted though). She was wearing the prettiest yellow sundress and had her hair up in a nice ponytail. I gave her a plumeria flower to wear in her hair, and then we headed off.

First we went down to the store to fill up my cooler with ice, snacks, and drinks, and to pick up lunch from the counter. Then, we went out to a longtime favorite beach of mine and spent the rest of the day there.

We ate lunch and talked story for a while, then went swimming, then we went for a walk down the beach, then we rested and talked story some more, then we just kicked back and listened to music for a while (and I got to hear her sing, she sounds beautiful), then we went swimming some more, and finally we watched the sunset.

As we were watching the sunset, we were sitting down on the ground next to each other holding hands. I told her today had been great and I couldn't think of anywhere else I would rather be right now. She said she also had a great time, and that she really liked being around me. We looked at each other for a bit until she decided to pull me in and kiss me! It was my first kiss with anyone in my life, and let me tell you, I fucking loved it. We spent the next 20 minutes laying there on the beach kissing and making out passionately.

After we were done making out, I decided it was time to go. I would've loved to stay for a few more hours, but was getting dark, and the area gets really dangerous at night with all the drug dealers and addicts running around. We drove around for a little bit before I dropped her off at home, and we shared another good night kiss before I left.

Well, I can tell this girl is a keeper. I can't wait until our next date, and to see what comes ahead for us in the future.

TL;DR - Update to previous post. Date went awesome.","This is soooo cuteee üò≠üò≠i am glad it went well , keep her"
dating,hhkn54,2020-06-28 19:26:21,So a guy buys you a drink....,"So I am a female, sitting at a bar all alone, enjoying my afternoon. The guy from across the bar buys me a drink. The bartender brought it over. I look back to say thanks. The guy is actively looking the other way. He never comes over to talk to me. I finally see him go to the bathroom. So I walk over and ask his friend. ""So is he ever going to come say hello.‚Äù He tells me he will mention it to him. So he comes out, and I can hear him in the background say, ""Why do I have to go talk to her.‚Äù Long story short he finally does. So Reddit, what is the receptors cue when one buys a drink?","I'm going to guess he told his friend that he found you attractive, his friend then egged him on to buy you a drink.

dating,a7d5nn,2018-12-18 17:30:01,"PSA: if you‚Äôre obsessing over how long it‚Äôs taking him/her to text you back or hang out, it‚Äôs time to drop him/her","Let me explain to you guys a revelation that I had in the last 24 hours.

Yesterday I posted about my unhealthy obsession with how long it was taking for the guy Im dating to text me back (every 4-5 hours). But I never sat there and thought : WHY am I exhibiting these behaviors? And then another thought came to me... why am I paying so much attention to MY behavior and not HIS?


I was making excuses for him. He‚Äôs really busy at work. He‚Äôs taking a nap. He‚Äôs out with his friends. Which are all valid excuses. But the weren‚Äôt why he wasn‚Äôt texting me back. He‚Äôs just NOT that into me. 


Here‚Äôs the thing. We‚Äôre all pretty smart. We KNOW what interest looks like. When we start obsessing over someone‚Äôs texting/calling patterns and how often they ask us to hang out, it‚Äôs because they haven‚Äôt been making their interest clear. And with that uncertainty comes the unhealthy, obsessive thinking.

I‚Äôve dated plenty of guys and I know that the ones who are truly interested won‚Äôt go a day without texting or calling. They won‚Äôt say they‚Äôre not ready for a relationship ‚Äújust yet‚Äù when you‚Äôve already been dating for months. Because any person who‚Äôs truly interested in you and sees the amazing human being that you are would be so incredibly excited to take you off the market. 

I‚Äôm coming to the conclusion that this guy is just not that into me. And I‚Äôm going to be strong enough to not message him anymore because I respect myself too much to just be texted or called whenever he feels like it. 

And with that revelation and decision, I realized how much anxiety I‚Äôve been harboring over his behavior for the last 5 days. 

Im intelligent
I‚Äôm resilient 
I‚Äôm kind
I‚Äôm loving 

And I‚Äôm no longer waiting for that text to validate me. And that makes me feel free.



EDIT: for the people calling me clingy and telling me to chill out. I‚Äôm merely speaking from my own experience with this one particular guy I‚Äôve been dating for two months. He went from texting me every hour or so and calling me every night to texting back every 4-5 hours and not calling and not texting at all during the weekends. While still saying he‚Äôs interested but not ready for a relationship ‚Äújust yet‚Äù. But would introduce me to his friends as ‚Äúhis girl‚Äù.

A lot of mixed signals. And I‚Äôm not willing to deal with it anymore.",Great post. I can relate to this as I‚Äôve done the same.

I started dating a cute girl, much better looking than me at least, and immediately people who were before neutral towards me started being hostile, they would start to be prickly to me at work, especially when she would come and visit me at work, and sometimes they would actively seek to make me look bad in front of her..... like once my manager specifically waited for her to come in to rage at me over something.... and other times they tried to out alpha me around her, as in they would deliberately bring up embarrassing moments from my past or take a passive aggressive or snark tone in response to me.

I think regardless of their intentions,  when a guy sees another guy with a pretty girl , it can sometimes trigger a response in him that makes them combative ,like ""he must think he's much better than me"", similar to someone having a high position at work or having big muscles.

Just something to keep in mind.

dating,ds7ctu,2019-11-05 23:16:14,Insight: When someone says they don‚Äôt want a relationship or a relationship ‚Äúright now‚Äù it really means a relationship with you,"EDIT 2 and DISCLAIMER: Yes, this doesn‚Äôt apply 100% of the times. Just like with every other general advice take it with a grain of salt and assess how it works in your situation.

*****
ORIGINAL POST:

Take it from someone doing it right now. If you are dating and meeting new people you may get with someone whom you click with either sexually or have fun BUT not  necessarily want a relationship with.  

Not wanting a relationship ‚Äúright now‚Äù only really means ‚Äúnot with you‚Äù. 

Yes there are occasions where this isn‚Äôt true and the person doesn‚Äôt want to be in a relationship period, but most of the times it means they are waiting for someone else (sometimes someone they haven‚Äôt met but an archetype different than you). 

The best you can do is not waste your time and move on or accept it will go nowhere and enjoy it.

As for me I am pretty open towards the beginning what type of relationship I see myself having with the other person so there are no confusions.

EDIT: To the dozen people saying ‚Äúnot always‚Äù: It‚Äôs right there in the third paragraph. I already said is not always the case but in general terms this applies.","I would 100% agree with this until I was put in this situation recently. I got out of a relationship with a VERY toxic person. Ended up meeting someone soon after and he was wonderful but I had to tell him I wasn‚Äôt ready because my mind was just so messed up. He said it was fine, but still worked through it with me and recently he asked about trying out this whole dating thing and I was ready and now everything is dandy. But there are definitely situations where it really means not wanting a relationship with you"

***Quit sharing dick pics.***

There's another way to get women!

Wait. What?!? No way! Really?!?

Yes. Really.

Just so you know that I know what I'm talking about, here are some facts:

\- I've been married for 25 years.  
\- I am 50 years old.  
\- My wife and I have had an open relationship for the last 15 years.  
\- In the last five years I have dated over a dozen different women. By ""dated"" I don't mean dinner and a movie. I mean taking them home or going home with them. You figure out the rest.  
\- In the year immediately before lockdown I ""dated"" seven different women.  
\- I'm not especially good looking or fit. I'm pretty average looking. I have glasses, a beard, and I'm a HUGE nerd.  


Ready for the other way to get women?

Are you sure?

Here goes...

Talk to them.

I said talk TO them, not AT them. Ask questions about their likes and dislikes. Ask them about their goals and aspirations. Listen to their answers. Relate to them when you can. Don't assume you're right, and FOR FUCKS SAKE (here's the big one) don't assume that they are wrong about ANYTHING. If they are wrong about a fact and you KNOW they're wrong, just let it go. (Unless it's literally life-or-death.)

Human beings (yes...women are human beings) want to talk about themselves more than others. Resist the urge to talk about yourself. Encourage her to talk about herself. Don't try to show how smart you are or how strong you are. And DON'T SHOW YOUR DICK UNTIL SHE ASKS!!!!

Here's another secret: Women don't care what your dick looks like. All dicks look pretty much the same. Half the population has one. If she wanted a random dick she could get it. Yours isn't that impressive to her. She's seen bigger.

Do the thing that the other guy didn't do: Show some interest in her directly.

Trust me on this... or don't. My dating life is going pretty good.",Instructions unclear. Got pepper sprayed. Please help.

So my girlfriend struggles with sleeping, especially now that Covid-19 is about and we are actually in isolation.
So last night she asked me to tell her a bedtime story to help her sleep.
I was feeling super tired and considered just saying no, but I decided that if it was for her I could do my best.
So what better story than Shrek? 
My storytelling skills are by no means legendary, but it made me really happy when, after talking in my Shrek accent, she burst out laughing, told me she was falling asleep now but couldn‚Äôt help but laugh at my impression, and hugged me until she fell asleep.
Super wholesome and I didn‚Äôt know who else to share it with.","oh my goodness this is so great. thanks for sharing!! this is so funny and cute.

The only acceptable answers are yes or no.  Anything else (I'll let you know, maybe next week, don't you have work tomorrow?) then treat it as a ""No thanks.  Not interested."". Keep it professional and move on.

If she comes back and repeats the flirting, getting close, putting herself in your orbit, ask her out again.  If she says everything but yes, then my friend, you are just around for attention (i.e - being bread-crumbed).  From here just draw the line in the sand and keep it at hi and bye.  That's it. Take back your power.  99% sure she'll come around ""Oh what's wrong?"" ""You're acting so weird."".  Do not.  I repeat. Don't fall for it!  She knows exactly what's going on and  she's looking for a defensive retort to show she can still get attention from you.  Just tell her straight up, ""We're cool.  I'll catch you around.""

When you go to the grocery store there is a little section that sells flowers usually close to the door. It‚Äôs $10-$15 for flowers. Find buds that haven‚Äôt opened completely and they will look good for 2-4 weeks. 2 seconds of effort is all it takes.

Seems cliche, I know, but it really works. Your 2 seconds of effort and $10 is going to earn you as many points as a very expensive dinner. At one point I was embarrassed to walk through the store with flowers, you‚Äôll get over it when you see how much it means to the recipient.

Then i met a younger guy than me at where i work, we talk and realized that we have much in common, including our sense of humor and hobbies. Over time, he made me fall for him, i have a crush on him so badly that i cut contact with all of my fwbs and having less party so i can have time around him.

He wasnt some sort of role model or playboy i had sex with, hes just an average normal joe whos still a virgin. But his personality and the way he cared for people around him plus his maturity make me fall for him hard.

I asked him out and he said yes. We dated for a while and it was the best months of my life, the way he cared for me and praising me make me feel safe and comfortable. He even when out of his way to cook for me when im badly sick, something that havent happened to me before.

It came to an end when he asked about my bodycount. I told him the exact amount and he was really shocked, he then asked us to break up because he was really intimidated by my past, and that we arent compatible.

I tried everything to change his mind, making treats for him, talk to him, non of it work. He still insist on a break up, seeing theres no point in trying, i let him go.

dating,qn2l78,2021-11-05 03:47:37,Men‚Äôs advice. Using your fingers (while building tension) is your greatest asset in the bedroom,"Fingering is usually thought of a mild activity that teenagers engage in when discovering sex for the first time, not a key component of foreplay between experienced adults.

Many guys mistakenly associate foreplay with being a submissive, weak behavior that puts their own pleasure as an afterthought. These type of men are fools. Skipping foreplay is not dominant behavior.

Slowly building anticipation, kissing, touching, and using fingers to rub and stimulate their woman are crucial for the most satisfying sex. She will be wetter, less inhibited, and feel more bonded to you because she will associate you with pleasing her and engaging her emotions.

Here are some of the ways that I have personally found to be most effective. All women are different. Communicate, be observant of how she reacts, and see what she likes.

While kissing, sucking on her nipples, and kissing her neck, use your index and middle fingers to rub the general area of the head of the clitoris in a broad, gentle, yet firm clockwise motion. You don‚Äôt need to target the clit exactly yet, just build tension by stimulating her with this motion in the general and kissing her. After a few minutes, use those same fingers in a more slightly more vigorous vertical motion in the same area.

Enter her using your index and middle finger And use a ‚Äòcome here motion‚Äô, brushing up against the upper wall of her vagina ( imagine she‚Äôs lying on her back). This area is the over mythicized G-spot, which is a part of the clitoral nerves inside the vagina. Instead of using a come hither motion, you can also use the same fingers to press up against the upper vaginal wall with a pulsing, heartbeat-like rhythm

The upper ‚Äòpinch‚Äô. If she is on her back, enter with only your index finger and use the ‚Äòcome hither‚Äô motion mentioned previously. Simultaneously, use your thumb in clockwise motion that brushes over her clitoris. This requires a little coordination. When you are bringing your index finger back, you are moving over with your thumb, kind of like you‚Äôre pinching with the fleshy part your index finger and thumb, but not with the tips.

The lower or ‚Äòperineal‚Äô pinch. I learned this from the book ‚ÄòShe Comes First‚Äô. If she is on her back, you enter using your index finger stimulating the lower ‚Äòwall‚Äô of the vagina, while your thumb ‚Äòpinches‚Äô the outside part, above her asshole. The feedback I‚Äôve gotten on this is that it‚Äôs not as pleasurable as the ‚Äòupward‚Äô motion, but still provides a unique stimulation that hasn‚Äôt been experienced.

Adding oral. Using your tongue to flutter on the head of her clit while using the ‚Äòcome hither‚Äô or the ‚Äòperineal pinch‚Äô motion will bring things full circle. However, if she indicates she is ready for intercourse, keep her waiting a few more minutes. Confidently, yet playfully say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not done yet.‚Äù This will bring with tension level higher, which will make the sex even hotter.",I volunteer as tributeü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

About a week ago, I learned she used to cut herself a lot, and had bloody clothes.. Last time I was at her place, she was wearing them. That was the first ""okay, what the fuck?"" moment. Next thing: I was in the kitchen with her father cooking, then went into the living room where I found her sister, chatted her up for a bit (I've known her for years), and then went to find my gf in her completely dark room, cutting up plush bears, while chanting my name. That was the cue for me to get the fuck out of there. For the past week or so, I rarely replied to her, and she started catching on, so I broke the news to her. Now I'm waiting for a reply and thinking if I should watch my back on the streets or not.. For a little backstory: She has been deeply in love with me for the past 3 years to the point of obsession.. I didn't know about that until today. She used to take pictures of me in the streets both during daytime and at night.. That creeped me the f out..And the icing on the cake: She has followed me multiple times. I saw her each time, but thought nothing of it, it isn't a large city.Well, thank you for reading this little post about my batshit crazy ex. I can answer any questions you may have, but please, keep it civil.",Well first off are you feeling okay?
dating,l7uit4,2021-01-29 14:57:48,ending things with fwb,"i'm going to end things with my fwb. We've been on what you would call ""dates"" and he even texts me sometimes. He doesn't pressure me to have sex. I really like him and I want to get to know him more and more but in the beginning, he told me he wasn't at a place in his life for a relationship and that's what I want. I don't want to be afraid to be attached to him and form an emotional connection so before anything goes any further I'm leaving.","Before you end it, I'd say why you're ending it. Say I'm developing feelings, and am wanting more than what we have. Ask him if he feels the same, ask him if he needs time to think about it. I had a FWB for 5 months. I ended up falling in love, even though we both stated we didn't want a relationship.

I finally told him it hurt, it was hurting to be with him and not date him. He said he needed to think about it and I respected that. He gave it a week and decided he wanted to date me. It doesn't always end that way, but, take the risk, shoot your shot"

dating,w03p08,2022-07-16 00:40:16,My now ex-girlfriend ghosted me after she......,"Had too much to drink and pooped on herself. We went on a trip for a weekend getaway. She had way too much to drink while she was on the patio of our air bnb after a very long day of touring and sightseeing after I had went to sleep. She tried to make it to the bathroom and accidentally dropped some of the poop on the carpet. 

When she woke up, I am sure that she was pretty embarrassed and then became very vague and her attitude totally changed. She ultimately blocked me on her phone and left. It sucked because I totally gave her the benefit of the doubt and even cleaned up the mess when I woke up in the middle of the night. It sucks because really did like her a lot. Lol

Anyways, should I just let this one go or should I hold out some hope. Shit does happen, right üòÜ","It was shitty of her to ghost you, you don't deserve that crap."
dating,bzpz8u,2019-06-12 11:22:15,"""You choose who you want to be with"" - Dating advice from my therapist","I started going to therapy recently and the subject of dating is a usual topic. I just wanted to share what she said because it made me think. Here's what happened.

So I asked her ""How do you meet people nowadays?"" she chuckled a bit and said ""I get that question a lot. Some people are great. They're intelligent, educated, good personality but they just have a hard time meeting people due to the nature of society nowadays (work first over personal life).""

I told her about my exes and 'my perfect boyfriend', I asked her if it was too much to ask for someone like that. She said ""Well, I'm not saying it's impossible but it'll be difficult."" then I said ""Okay, well I think I need to put myself out there more. Put myself in a position to meet this person.""

This is the part that hit me. She responded ""That's no guarantee either. You could go on a dating app and date 10 guys but none of them will be the one. You could go to classes and hobby groups but the chances of meeting someone is like 50/50. Even if you do meet someone you like, there's no guarantee they'll like you back. You can't control them.""

And then her advice was to just focus on things you can control, which is working on yourself.  When I started talking about ""the one"" or ""the one I'll be compatible with"" she was kinda shaking her head and she said ""We just choose who we end up with... so do you want the funny guy who isn't handsome? The handsome guy but is boring? Etc...""

I think what she was trying to say is that no one is going to be perfect and if we hold out for that person it'll be difficult and beyond our control. We're all just imperfect humans and we just choose which other imperfect human to be with.

So from this I'm somewhat changing my mindset about dating.

Anyway, would love to hear your thoughts on my therapists advice!",Did you just save me a therapy bill?
dating,eq4i7z,2020-01-17 18:44:56,This guy I was seeing told me he doesn't do relationships or intimacy but that we should keep seeing each other,"So I said ""PEACE.""

I've honestly heard this so many times in the past three/four years. These dudes want all the benefits of a relationship without any commitment or putting work in. 

I'm tired of compromising my own needs and desires because someone else likes the attention/sex/company. 

It's the first time I haven't just reluctantly entered a situation I didn't wanna be in where I knowingly end up getting hurt just because I want to try to make things work. I'm actually so proud of myself for having the self-respect to dip from that before I got even more invested. It was a really really hard decision to make.

Here's hoping I'll stick with it.","Yes, just like guys have to decline the offer of being friend-zoned, women need to decline the offer of being sex-zoned."
dating,g4orpc,2020-04-20 08:05:44,People are WAY too obsessed with getting texts back immediately,"I feel like almost every question on here is some form of ""They don't text everyday, are they not interested?"" ""I haven't gotten a message in 2 days, am I being ghosted?"" or ""They haven't texted me back yet, what does it mean?""  


I feel like this sub in general is supportive and gives good insight, but am I the only person who doesn't need to text everyday with someone I just met/started seeing? I often see posts of people freaking out over 2 or 3 days of not talking. Most of the time I don't think this is a big deal. I feel like people forget that others have lives outside of their dating lives.


EDIT: 

The general consensus seems to be that it really depends on the context. And yeah, I agree. But I feel like I‚Äôve seen a lot of posts on this sub where OP is concerned/paranoid simply because of breaks greater than a day in between texting when otherwise the person seemed interested and everything else was fine.

I also want to emphasize that my post isn‚Äôt directed at people in serious relationships. (A few comments talked about how they would text their SO everyday and I definitely understand that.)","I think it‚Äôs more when people change their pattern of texting. If someone‚Äôs a slow texter fine, if it takes a day or two to get a reply then that‚Äôs cool. But it‚Äôs when someone goes from texting quickly and putting in effort, to taking days to reply then something is usually up."
dating,ptkbyq,2021-09-23 01:11:57,Do you practice safe sex?,"A lot of my friends usually sleep with the partner on the first date. I tend to avoid it, regardless of the chemistry.

dating,s98l23,2022-01-21 11:21:18,"Girl Wants to Go on a Second Date, but Insists on Going to the Exact Same Place as Before? What's Going on Here...","I matched with a girl on Tinder and we chatted and agreed to go on a date on Wednesday. I asked her out for a drink and she said she'd be more comfortable getting coffee. I thought, ""that's fine, first Tinder date you can never be too safe."" So I suggested a couple places and we decided on a Starbucks.

Date went great and shortly after we parted ways I asked if she'd like to go out again. She said yes and then specified that she's not trying to rush things and doesn't want to have sex right away. I said that's fine and I asked her if she was free this weekend. Again she said yes, so I suggested going to fun bar in town. She said she still wasn't comfortable doing that...I asked her what part of it she was uncomfortable about, the unfamilar bar, the alcohol, or the evening, and she said all three. So now I'm starting to think maybe there's a problem. I suggest getting a pizza instead and she seems happy with that suggestion and agrees to get a pizza Friday (today).

Late last night she writes me saying she'd be more comfortable going for a walk or for coffee again. I'm a bit annoyed, but I agree again. I say that it's too cold for a walk but suggest another coffee shop we could meet at. She says that finding parking is hard and asks if we can go to the same Starbucks we went to last time...

This is weird because the two coffee shops are close to each other and I  don't want to go to the same Starbucks again for a second date.... (Also the Starbucks is loud, busy, has horrible lighting, has worse coffee, is more expensive, and is altogether not as nice as the place I suggested). I tell her that the coffee shop is less than a ten minutes walk from where she parked for Starbucks and it would be nice to walk together there, etc. The last thing she wrote is ""Is there any chance to convince you to go to Starbucks?"" with about twenty of the cringe emojis after it.

What's going on here???

Edit: I wrote her saying that I've never heard of going on a second date to the same place as the first... and asked if she was still feeling anxious about me. She replied that she's not anxious just tired and felt more like going to Starbucks. So to me, it just seems that she's used to getting her way and doesn't have any consideration for what I want...

Edit 2: Went on the date. It's so weird people are hating on *me* for literally wanting to do anything other than the exact same thing as last time like I'm the weird one here somehow. Crazy. I have a feeling people didn't even read the post... Anyway, I'll post a description of the date in the comments for people to downvote. This is a throwaway so idgaf 

And the things people were speculating about:

She had never been to this Starbucks before the first date. She lives outside of town, me in a city, so it wasn't a safety thing to go to the exact same Starbucks. The other coffee shop is obviously in a public area, etc etc.

She drinks alcohol quite a bit, so that's not the reason. Apparently people on reddit think that going out for a drink means getting blasted and losing self-control? Jesus. 

I don't pay for other people on dates generally so this was never an issue in play. When I arrived on the first date, she was already seated with a piece of cake and a coffee. ","Bro, just go to coffee again if you really like her.
Best case scenario you‚Äôre making her feel comfortable  on a second date with a familiar location and setting.  Worst case scenario you‚Äôre paying a couple bucks for coffee. 
This whole ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to waste my time‚Äù thing is a terrible mindset to have so early in. 
Dating in its very essence is gambling your time, so this thing about you ‚Äúwasting it‚Äù sounds very inexperienced.

She sounds like she may be a bit anxious/have past trauma - it sounds like you may not interested in catering to this, that‚Äôs fine, maybe just move on then.
She isn‚Äôt in the wrong for wanting to feel comfortable, and if you really liked her you‚Äôd make that a priority."

As a person living at home, im also substantially more up against it. I thought things were going well with this girl, lots of video calls, texting a lot all day long (part of the problem really, we set the bar too high too soon) but its never quite hit the heights when we've met in person. Ordinarily, i think youd know exactly where you were headed with dates because you'd be able to plan fun stuff; mini golf, dinner, visiting cool little cocktail bars. But when your options are limited purely to walks in the countryside, in the cold UK winter, or going over to each others homes. Thats absolutely it. How are you supposed to gain momentum or chemistry on dates at a time like this? You're massively up against it. As much as it sucks as we're all absolutely fed up of this pandemic, especially here in the UK where it now looks like we won't be able to go and drink in a pub until nearly summer time. Don't really have a choice. Crossed this bridge too many times where things started very well with the dates but it quickly fizzled out.

dating,laterl,2021-02-02 11:20:34,"Sometimes people ARE interested but if you feel it's not enough, you have to let them go.","In other case, they will never be able to make you happy anyway. If you feel you're investing emotionally more than them from the very start, you're gonna do this throughout all your relationship and eventually become exhausted. Know your needs. Trust your gut. 

Yes, they may actually be busy people and interested in you at the same time. They may be sincerely apologizing for not texting back for a day or two because of their intensive schedule. Or not being able to spend discussed time with you due to working urgency. They may be really sorry about that. And if you're ready to cope with that - wonderful. But if you're not - THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT. Don't feel guilty to tell this person you're not emotionally compatible. Don't hesitate to end it. Don't waste time. Both theirs and yours. Know. Your. Needs. 

Remember, at the beginning everyone is trying to present themselves in a better light, subconsciously or not. And if you're suspicious about something at this very start, it will become worse. Don't torture yourself doubting and struggling with your feelings. Trust. Your. Gut. 

If on the 1st date you come to another city to see a person for 3 days and on the last day you end up wandering alone because they had a working urgency which somehow didn't allow them to text you even the smallest ""You ok there?"" throughout the whole day AND if it is a red flag for you - trust it. It's not gonna get better. (yep, this is a small venting part) 

Let them go off your life. They'll be all right if you get things straight and honest. Seek for someone who is able to give you what you demand from a healthy and prosperous relationship. There is the person somewhere around, trust me. 

P. S. Not a native speaker, sorry for any grammar mistakes folks.","I‚Äôm really just starting to learn that through a bunch of heartache. 

Met this guy a bit less than a year ago - a lot of things were going really well. Except that I never felt wanted. Not enough texts for me, not enough affection, not enough affirmation. Throughout the 3-4 months we dated (exclusively), I kept feeling like I was the crazy, demanding one (not because they‚Äôd say so, just from my inner voice). 

Turns out, they DID want me, they DID like/love me, they DID want to make it work. But couldn‚Äôt. And that‚Äôs the bottom line. It doesn‚Äôt matter if they are ‚Äòtoo busy‚Äô or just ‚Äònot good in showing emotions‚Äô or ‚Äòtoo used to being alone‚Äô, or any other reason. There were legitimate reasons from his part, not excuses, and I believe that. But at the end of the day it. Doesn‚Äôt. Matter. Why. You. Feel. Neglected. 

I‚Äôm assuming he did try is darnest best, he did give 200%, he did exert energy. But unfortunately, some people‚Äôs 200% is only going to reach my 60%. And while I‚Äôm putting in my 100%, he‚Äôll never see the difference between us. 

Letting him go was incredibly hard, but with every passing day I‚Äôm growing more confident in my decision. Not because I deserve ‚Äòbetter‚Äô, there was nothing inherently ‚Äòwrong‚Äô with him. I just deserve *different* - one that is naturally matching to my energy and effort levels."

Well I came across an interesting article that can shed some light on why this is happening.

If you search up ""Why Do Women Have The Upper Hand On Tinder"". The article will go into the different experiences men and women have on these dating apps.

If the data they present is to believed, it shows that on average women will pass on 95% of the options presented to them vs the 47% for men. So out of 100 guys they will only like 5 and match with 1.

It just shows that women are just pickier with the people that they match with. It really is all just a numbers game and if you are not finding success it has no bearing as to your worth as a man or what you can bring to a relationship. Stop thinking that it as an indicator that you are undesirable or undateable.","Not only this, but a lot of men make their dating profiles surrounding the male gaze instead of the female gaze.

So this is across Tinder and Bumble. It would start off as a normal conversation, getting to know each other, and then out of the blue, they would ask for a nude. 

I guess I don't understand why they would think that would be appropriate to ask or maybe they've done it in the past and people have said yes? Personally, I am just shocked someone would ask that and it just makes me think they were only talking to me to get to that point. They were only talking to me in hopes I would send them a nude. Part of me wants to ask them why they think it's okay to ask that, but I typically will just unmatch and not engage.

dating,oywwyi,2021-08-06 01:46:43,I (25 f) recently got back together with my high school sweetheart (27 m). I found some of the old letters he wrote me.,"I was going through some of my old stuff and I found the love letters my boyfriend wrote me while we were in high school. We grew up across the street from each other and his sister and I have been friends our whole lives. He was like my friend too but I‚Äôd always had this huge crush on him. He and I dated all through high school and went our separate ways when he joined the Marines after he graduated. We reconnected last year at his sister‚Äôs wedding and recently decided we both wanted to get back together.

Anyway when I started my freshman year high school he was a junior. He secretly started slipping me little notes from time to time complimenting me on my hair or telling me he thought I was cute. It was all really sweet and we kept our crushes on each other a secret for a while until he asked me to the homecoming dance.

Then after we started dating he‚Äôd write me notes all the time with these little cartoons on them. He even drew me a little comic book that showed us running off and getting married in Las Vegas then my dad chasing him out of the country. They‚Äôre all kids stuff but they‚Äôre really sweet and I decided to bring them to his house and show them to him.

He seemed genuinely touched that I had saved all of those letters. Almost two years of stuff that he wrote to me and drew for me. We read them together and he laughed at some of the corny stuff he used to write to me. I told him that as a girl 14-16 years old it was the thrill of a lifetime to get this stuff from a guy I‚Äôd had a crush on for most of my life.

Well it was a fun evening and like I said he seemed really touched by the whole thing. So before I left he drew me a little cartoon of me carrying him out of his job like Richard Gere did in that one movie. I‚Äôm going to frame that one.","No comments, just want to say that was such a sweet story!"

TW: sexual assault,

Need advice and/or support.

I'm still processing this a bit, and kind of hoped the denial would hold and I could just move on. I'm finding that hard today.

I agreed to a date on hinge last night, and we met for drinks. After a nice date, I agreed to a nightcap, with the statement that I wanted to take things slow and was down to continue hanging out but did not want to do anything physical. They agreed, and said that we could just hang out and talk a little more. I said I wanted to head home in about an hour but could hang out until then and they wanted to show me their place which was in walking distance (we had been discussing real estate and properties, etc and their personal reading and music so this wasn't very suspicious to me).

Upon arriving they showed me the restroom, then told me to choose any music I wanted and gave me their seat at their desk. They went to the restroom, but when they returned they pulled up a chair behind me, blocking me into their square shaped desk space then immediate grabbed my face + hair, aggressively kissed me and started pull down my shirt and grabbing at my chest. We had not kissed or touched intimately in any way shape or form before this point, or discussed doing anything physical. I tried to remove their hands. I asked them to stop and physically pushed their hands off my shirt multiple times , but they were forceful. I had been drinking, and am disappointed in myself for giving up and letting this person violate my boundaries rather than start a fight and see how they would react. I never gave consent and they continued to try to remove my clothes. I removed their hands again and tried to move them off me and get them to back away but due to their physically aggressive tactics, I eventually stopped fighting them off and just wanted the encounter to be over. I distinctly remember telling myself, whatever, if this is happening I may as well try to enjoy it in some way or dissociate and at least I will never have to see this person again. They physically forced me to the bed and painfully and forcefully penetrated me with their fingers without asking - by this point I'm stripped of my clothes and roughed up and do not believe I can overpower them. I also sensed that fighting back would only excite them more or escalate their aggression so I tried to give little to no reactions or seem unphased. I was at least able to insist upon protection before any intercourse which I'm very grateful they complied with.

Unfortunately the person became increasingly physically aggressive with me and choked and slapped me multiple times during the encounter and generally treated me violently. I left and got home as quickly as possible afterwards while trying to act nonchalant so that nothing would escalate. They asked me when it was over what I had meant by taking things slow, and I said, ""not this.""  I woke up this morning with bruising across my chest. I've showered twice, cried spontaneously and am having trouble shaking this off.

I really did not want to tell anyone about this because I felt that would make it too real for me. I decided to confide in my cousin and also report the person on hinge with photo evidence of the bruising. I figured at least getting them removed from the platform may save some other women from having this happen to them. Hinge was very prompt and empathetic sending resources and let me know the user was banned. I don't know if it's worth filing a police report. I know their building address from calling an uber but not their unit number and otherwise only have a first name that I believe is not real (they were from Korea, but gave their American name).

I'm new to dating from a long term relationship, and while I've always known about these risks I've always believed I was a decent judge of character and that people more often than not would prove to be good. I also am doubting myself and feeling extremely upset that I could have done more to say no or fight back.

Hurting, and really feeling for everyone who has ever been through something like this or worse.",File a report. Also call the RAINN hotline for advice and support. I‚Äôm so sorry!
dating,n8p080,2021-05-09 22:14:17,Seeing my friends and their friends all in a relationship makes me feel like an outsider looking in,"I had such a fun time at the lake with my friends yesterday. After the long day, they all went home with their partners and I went home by myself. The initial fun and excitement wore off and now I‚Äôm left feeling incredibly empty. I‚Äôm not a serial dater, it‚Äôs been two years since my ex and I broke up and I‚Äôve been single since. In the span of two years even my most independent anti-relationship friends managed to find love. There is absolutely nothing wrong with me: men  my age find me attractive; I can find a date; I can find a situationship; I CANNOT find someone who genuinely loves and cares about me. I have lots of other things going for me but the ONE thing that seemingly finds others will not find me. I cannot for the life of me figure out what my issue is and believe me, I‚Äôve asked A LOT of people for feedback. I feel like I‚Äôm encased in a glass box surrounded by other people. Despite my efforts (apps, socializing in groups, etc) I haven‚Äôt found a partner who truly values my presence in their life, 
which crushes me. I‚Äôve always been the one to be strung along and given the round about. Like an idiot, I‚Äôd develop feelings only to be ghosted or discarded months later. I know I sound melodramatic in this post but damn I hate always feeling like this :(

Edit: I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm perfect. I just don‚Äôt have any super obvious deficits that would prevent me from finding what I‚Äôm looking for.... at least that‚Äôs what my friends say ü§î","Your post is hitting home right now. Today has been a sad day for me, just feeling lonely and would love to find some one to care and love, and do the same for me. Fairly decent looking guy, no issues I'm aware of, just find it extremely hard to find the person for me. She might be out there, probably not, getting used to the idea of being alone for the rest of life is pretty effing scary!! Oh well, just know you aren't alone. :)"
dating,hm1l11,2020-07-06 05:18:21,Bf and I fell in love while on shrooms during COVID-19 pandemic!,"Ok so I just wanted to share my story because before this happened, I was searching for threads like this all over reddit and Google and couldn't find that many! And I hope this short (long) story inspires some hope for those lost hopeless romantics who feel like they'll never find ""the one""!

Alright so I (22 f) started talking to this guy (21 M) I had as a friend on Facebook but never really talked to. We had people in common, went to different schools, but didn't really know each other personally (aside from Facebook stuff).


Anyway, I had just gotten out of a long term relationship that i had already gotten over months prior. (On and off and not a good time).


So I was reading this book at work one day, and out of the blue I thought to myself ""hey this main character description sounds a lot like this guy I have as a friend on Facebook."" I ended up messaging him at around 6am to tell him. I have no idea why, I just wanted him to know, and I wanted him to read the book. Anyway a few messages later, he said he was interested in reading the book! I was so excited. I love when people take interest in things I'm interested in, because I love discussing them. Anyway I didn't think much of it, I was mostly excited that he wanted to read the book. So I said he could borrow my copy, and i would drop it off after work. WELL the copy I had at the time wasn't even mine, it was borrowed (from a patient of mine). 

So right after work, I drove to the nearest barnes & noble (20 miles from my house) and got the book. This store is located inside a shopping mall, so while I was there, I picked up a bunch of makeup and clothing because I was so excited. It wasn't until after I got into my car that I asked myself ""why am I so excited? Why did I buy all this stuff?"" So he told me where he lived, I drove to his house to drop off the book. I was so nervous. He finally came out, i gave him the book through the car window, he got it and rushed off back into his house and said ""thanks! Sorry I gotta go. I have something on the stove.""
I was like wow okay I guess thats is. I mean what did I expect? 


But NO. We ended up talking more and more and hanging out almost every single night. It was ALWAYS an adventure with this guy. He didn't even have to try. Somehow the night just always ended up being so much fun. We hung out at this lake by our town mostly and just talked. Or we'd go to some views around the city. This went on for about 3 weeks. 

During that whole time, our relationship was completely platonic. We did not confess feelings for each other, we did not compliment each other, we did not flirt AT ALL, we did not kiss, hug, hold hands, go to each others houses, we didn't make crude jokes about sex or dating. It was like we were becoming close friends. Not once did he flirt with me or try to make a move. NOT. ONCE.


So when we first started hanging out, I was guarded and told myself I would not develop a crush for this guy and I would not flirt with him or allow myself to catch feelings. I even restricted myself from admitting he was cute. I limited myself to only talking about past relationships vaguely and not talking about my interests in guys or relationships. I will admit i did this mostly because I thought this guy was WAY out my league, even before I met him. He's one of those guys that gets a bunch of likes on Facebook and gives off those talks-to-a-million-girls vibes. At least thats what i thought back then (yes i know I'm ashamed for thinking this way). I didn't want him to think I was just another girl that was going to be all over him. 


So over time I actually started to catch myself day dreaming about him. I would immediately stop myself. I was really trying not to like this guy. But I couldn't help it. He has an amazing personality, he's so much fun without even trying to be. He always seemed so genuine and never tried too hard at anything. He didn't try to impress me he was just himself. And I always thought he was soooo handsome. But too handsome for me. I mean i think I'm okay looking, but at the time I just thought this guy would never see me that way. Especially with how interesting he is. I considered myself pretty boring. The home-body type.


So one day he told me about his shroom experience. That was probably the first time he told me something so personal. He told me he used to be really quiet, shy, insecure, angry. I was really surprised because this did not seem like him at all. He wasn't shy when first meeting me. He's so patient and nice. He always had something to talk about. He just seemed like the perfect social butterfly.


I had never experienced shrooms before, but I was interested. So a few weeks later, I decided I wanted to try something new.


My life was in a great place. I was newly single, my career was taking off. I loved my job, was making really good money, things at home were great, my friends were all around me. This guy was making things really interesting. Life was just awesome.


So I decided I wanted to try shrooms. I did so. Much. Research. I researched for days. Any chance I got, I spent planning and researching. I ended up coming up with this idea. I'd find us a really nice comfortable place where we could trip safely. I really wanted this to be an unforgettable experience for him (at the time I wouldn't admit why). So i first asked him if he wanted to do shrooms. He said yes. I asked about his schedule for work. So I ended up getting an air bnb really cheap (very beginning of pandemic, pre-stay-at-home enforcement).


 I planned the whole thing. What we would eat. Activities while we tripped. I got different type of bud just in case he had a preference. I made sure the air bnb was in a woodsy location because I knew he was really into that type of environment. I had to locate a plug for the shrooms too which is not easy in a small town, but i was determined!!
I was soooo ready!


Its important to note that at this time, I was so not sure if he liked me or even found me attractive. He was so aloof. Never complimented me on my looks. Never made a move. Never really showed an interest in me other than just as friends.(Although we never discussed this or had the ""I'm only looking for friends conversation"") I just assumed he only wanted to be friends because of his lack of hinting.


So I decided to just drill it into my brain that this was completely for the shroom experience and would not be romantic at all (me desperately trying not to get my hopes up or formulate unrealistic expectations).
So the day came, he was ready, and we headed up the mountain completely innocent and clueless.


The drive was unbelievably beautiful. Everything was so clear and green with amazing views of the mountains and sparkly lakes. He showed me his favorite music. He had even made me a playlist on spotify. It was becoming harder and harder to not get my hopes up. Every time I looked over at him I just kept thinking holy cow this handsome and unbelievably interesting guy is really taking the time out of his day and willingly spending his weekend with me üò∞ 


I'll admit I was a bit skeptical at first, how was this guy so perfect? Why has he been hanging out with me so much? Why hasn't he tried anything? I kept waiting for there to be a catch üëÄ (to this day, four months later, there has been no catch, he's still perfect!)


So we got to the cabin. Of course it's beautiful. The view is incredible. BUT there's only one bedroom. Only one bed. I nervously explained to him that this was the best cabin with the best view and the best reviewed and that i didn't intend for us to sleep in the same bed, it was just the best choice. He said it was alright not a problem. I offered to sleep on the couch but of course, he said no that he would. So we explored for a bit. Prepared ourselves for the trip and got comfortable. Watched some movies while we waited for it to get dark. (Still nothing romantic at this point).


Then the time came for the shrooms! He ate them whole and i made mine in tea. Holy cowwwwww it WAS THE BEST FEELING AND EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE. I was tearing up for no reason. We were watching tippy music videos and just laughing and vibing. We kept expressing how beautiful everything was. And after a little while i started to really admire him. His smile just looked so beautiful and his eyes were extra shiny and i loved it. 

I ended up getting really nervous being around him but I couldn't tell him why because I didn't want to ruin things. I just covered myself with a blanket and sat on the couch as far from him as possible. He could tell something was wrong and was trying to comfort me. I could tell he was concerned so I tried my best to just act normal again. We were laughing again and I have no idea how we ended up in each other's arms but next thing you know he's smiling and laughing and then KISSED ME. I felt like I was a little kid again and It was like fireworks went off in my chest, I was like at the peak of my trip. After we stopped kissing, he said ""hold on, I'll  be right back."" I thought he was going to tbe bathroom. But when he came back, he was holding a small box in his hand, he gave it to me and I was completely shocked. He said ""i got this for you."" I open it and its this beautiful heart shaped necklace, the color of my birthstone, with matching earrings. I nearly died. This has never happened to me in my.life. I had never felt so wooed. 


After that, we just cuddled on the couch together. We were both super quiet. He kept asking if I was alright. Hell yeah I was better than alright. I just couldn't stop thinking about how amazing I felt and how much I loved what happened and how everything fell into place so perfectly. I couldn't stop thinking about how lucky I felt and I swear I felt like I was in a movie. The cabin was warm and cozy, it was super cold outside and foggy, and i was lying in this amazing guys' arms after he kissed me and gave me this amazing gift. I was quiet from the disbelief I was experiencing, but I'm pretty sure he thought I was quiet because I felt weird about what happened. I got up after a while and said I was going to bed. I was still kind of tripping at this point but for some reason I wanted to go to bed. 


After I got into bed, he came in a few moments later (as I hoped he would) and asked if we could share the bed. My heart almost exploded. He came in and we just started to spill the beans. He confessed that he really liked me, but never made a move because he didn't want me to feel like he was only hanging out with me to get with me and because he didn't want me to feel like things were moving too fast. He didnt want me to feel pressured. I confessed my feelings as well and we both couldn't stop talking about how we felt like we were in a movie and how we were just perfect for each other. This went on the whole night until almost morning time. He kept telling me he thought I was beautiful and interesting and perfect in every way. He kept holding me tight and seemed so happy. I'd never seen anyone so happy. 


We ended up having sex. AMAZING SHROOM SEX. We were coming down already but it was still out of this world.


We ate in the morning and then cuddled some more. We couldn't get enough of each other. On the drive home we held hands and couldn't stop talking about our feelings for each other and about the experience. 


We've been together 5 months now and I can honestly say I understand cheesy romance movies now. Hes still very lovey-dovey, we understand each other so well, we love doing things together. Despite our previous failed relationships we have NO trust issues. Not at all. Literally the only problem we have is that we both get cranky when we're hungry.

My family immediately accepted him. His family is the same with me. We've pretty much been dating throughout the whole pandemic and I honestly think it has made us really close. We're best friends and I honestly don't think theres any toxicity in our relationship. We communicate sooooooo well. We're both there for each other and it's amazing. We both have gone through so many things in the short time we've been together, but somehow, every issue seems so small because we get through these things together. Its just amazing how quickly someone can change your life so unexpectedly! We've both changed so much already in many different ways (for the better) in such a short amount of time!
It feels so unreal. I honestly never thought I could fall for someone. I really thought people just pretended to be happy or something. But nope healthy love is real!!! Anyway i just wanted to share this because I really love our story!! I hope everyone out there feeling like they'll never find ""the one"" read this and get a little hope out of it! It was 100% unexpected for him and I so i hope its the same for you :D!","TL;DR - Girl thinks guy is out of her league. They have a platonic friendship for several months until they do shrooms together and reveal feelings for each other. A loving relationship blooms during the pandemic.

Idk why I get so crazy in relationships man. I have a really hard time taking care of myself, becoming too dependent on the other person for comfort, love, emotional, physical and sexual fulfillment.

Idk man.","It sounds like you might be getting too much validation externally and that‚Äôs not a good place to be in, because it‚Äôs untenable. It means other people and circumstances easily control your emotions, happiness etc.

his exact words were ‚Äúyou‚Äôre so fucking cute and you make me so hard.‚Äù often times i think of cute as being an infantilizing compliment and a step down from being called pretty or beautiful etc,but i also found it super sweet. Is this a compliment? we‚Äôve been dating for a little bit.  I heard it‚Äôs more a term of endearment vs just a purely sexual compliment.


Later on,we were making out and he told me to stop for a few seconds because he wanted to just look at me. he looked at me while fondling me. i thought that was sweet too. never had anyone say that before.

ETA: never said cute was a bad thing or i was insulted by his words. i was just wondering what this means when a guy calls you that,and if it has a different,more emotional connotation to other compliments like hot","I think you‚Äôre over thinking this. It‚Äôs just a word. During sex you‚Äôre not exactly thinking about the correct word to use. If there was additional warning signs of him infantilising you then I would be worried.

dating,rdload,2021-12-10 23:25:33,Do you ever look at your significant other and wonder how the heck did I land you?,"I am the luckiest man to have my now wife. We met three years ago when she was visiting her sister. Her husband is my co-worker and they were having a barbecue for him for his birthday. That‚Äôs where I met her for the first time. Prettiest girl I‚Äôve ever seen but I didn‚Äôt want to approach her like that because I knew she lived miles away on the other side of the state and was only visiting but as the night went on, we talked for hours and she was funny, sweet and I couldn‚Äôt stop smiling. So we exchanged numbers, went out to dinner before she left and we kept in touch texting and calling for months before she came down again for the summer and we knew we wanted to give this a try. 

Long distance is fucking hard. Missing each other, scheduling calls, not being able to hug or kiss her but she had a job and I have a blue collar job as well. I almost broke up with her because I didn‚Äôt think it was going to work because the back and forth is rough and  I was trying to find a job near her but nothing so it was a surprise when she told me she had been looking for jobs near me for a while and had found one. 

4 months later, I proposed to her but with covid and all I felt bad we couldn‚Äôt make a big wedding but she insisted she hated the idea of wasting money on a big party when she would rather have something small. We ended up eloping, having a nice dinner for just close family and friends in the backyard and we‚Äôve been happy since and today she‚Äôs 3 weeks pregnant. She just told me last night.","Congratulations you lucky bastard.

dating,cqaaeo,2019-08-14 14:17:24,Option: I‚Äôll let you know if I have time. Priority: I‚Äôll make time.,"I‚Äôve been casually dating for a few months now and taking a slow approach to it. I know people are busy between jobs, parenting, hobbies and everyday life. But, that doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt put ANY
 effort into dating if it‚Äôs a priority to you. Sometimes it‚Äôs the little things that count! 

For example, connected with one guy via OLD and a month had gone by and still no date. He was always ‚Äúbusy‚Äù at work, with his kid, but would be snap chatting him by the pool or out and about lol. Final straw was when we had a date set up (finally) I ask for a time around 10 a.m and his response was ‚ÄúI‚Äôll let you know, I‚Äôm school shopping for my kid‚Äù. I get a text at 8:30 pm asking if I‚Äôm ready. No thanks. 

Fast forward to the guy I‚Äôm seeing now. Also very busy, works 12 hour shifts and coparents but we have had two dates within three weeks, we talk on the phone a few times a week, text sporadically through the day. When he has his kid I don‚Äôt blow his phone up, and vice versa (I coparent as well). The big difference is we prioritize that time. He sometimes falls asleep on the phone and I think it‚Äôs adorable. Last night, before telling me goodnight he apologized for the nights he falls asleep without telling me. *insert big cheesy smile*. Third date is a late dinner which I don‚Äôt usually do but I‚Äôm compromising due to him getting off work late. (Priority)

The moral of the story is, if someone is a priority to you, make time for them. No one likes to feel like they are simply an option. The End.",[deleted]
dating,pj7h5h,2021-09-06 20:13:42,Women who look for problems in men. Please stop it.,"Last weekend I went on a third date with a woman I genuinely liked.  I was looking forward to the date and spending more time with her. 

During dinner, she wouldn‚Äôt engage in a conversation but treated it as a job interview.  There was no back-and-forth ‚Äî the dance to get to know each other. 

Not wanting to make dinner about our exes, I kept my answers short and to the point and tried to change the topic multiple times.  

After about 45 minutes of her grilling me, she said, ‚ÄúYou need therapy to heal from your trauma.‚Äù

That wasn‚Äôt just a red flag; it was a five-alarm siren telling me to get up and walk away. 

I‚Äôm a grown man, and I‚Äôm happy with the person that I am. I have done a lot of personal work to survive and move on from my divorce. It has been five years, and it will remain a part of me; it is my history. But, it is not the only thing that makes me who I am today. 

She texted me after the date, saying she had a great time. I didn‚Äôt, and I will not be asking her out again.

dating,qky5ap,2021-11-02 06:29:36,I got rejected but. . .,"I asked out my crush and she told me she‚Äôs not looking for a relationship. I told her ‚Äúit‚Äôs ok I understand‚Äù.

I feel confused like I‚Äôm getting some mixed signals. My friend said, ‚Äúwhat if she just wants to be friends‚Äù. Part of it is that I still have feelings and have hope for something to happen with us. It‚Äôs hard to move on when she‚Äôs giving me this kind of attention while I‚Äôm trying to forget about her.

UPDATE: She‚Äôs my girlfriend","I assume your question here is either ""what do I do about this?"" or ""what does she mean by this?""

If the former, I recommend you being upfront about your boundaries. ""I had hopes of something serious to happen between us, but when I asked you out and you said you're not looking for a relationship, I respected your decision. I'm trying to get over the feelings I have for you, but you're not making it easy with the hugs and telling me you miss me. If friendship is all you want, then I'm asking for time apart so I can get over my feelings for you properly.""

If the latter, I recommend you asking her directly. ""Has anything changed from when you said you're not looking for a relationship? Or is your affection simply the friendly type?""

I don't think it's fair for her to toy with your feelings if she just wants an ego boost. But if she wants something more than friendship, she needs to communicate that with you clearly."
dating,g091oy,2020-04-13 01:26:48,Sometimes the most intimate moments are simply not captured.,"Hey guys, I know we live in a world that pays a lot of attention to social media. And I myself have fallen into the horrible spiral of comparing my relationship to some of the ones I see on social media. Seeing boyfriends post their girlfriends and publicly gush about them always made me feel warm and fuzzy inside, but I‚Äôve come to realize and fully accept that 1. not everything on social media is real 2. some of those couples mostly just post for the hype, and have problems we never see as ‚Äúoutsiders‚Äù 3. Some men/women express their love in different ways

Of course, these are things we‚Äôve all heard before. Everyone will tell you ‚Äúsocial media doesn‚Äôt matter‚Äù but sometimes we can‚Äôt help our feelings. When I was stuck with this fixation about wanting to be posted on social media, I stopped realizing the true intimacy that was in my relationship that could never compare. 

For example, my boyfriend was going to take a shower. He starts the shower but then comes back to the room and says ‚ÄúHow about you wash my hair for me?‚Äù I don‚Äôt know if you guys have ever washed your partner - but it is probably the most intimate and purest thing, definitely top 5 on my list. I happily agreed, and as he sits down so I can lather his head because he‚Äôs so tall, I just think how happy and close with him I feel at that moment. And the thought that came to my mind was ‚ÄúYou see, this is something you‚Äôll never be able to see on social media.‚Äù 

Then, before I left the shower (I had already showered and he just needed basically a scalp treatment because his dandruff was bothering him) I brought him one of my wash cloths and told him to use it on his pits lol. When he gets back in the room, the first thing he does is run up to me and tells me to smell his armpits! Once again, I laugh and think to myself ‚ÄúMan, we have gotten way too comfortable with each other and I love it.‚Äù Another moment that would never be posted on social media. 

Another example, anytime he brings me a glass of water, he always grabs a cup that has kittens on it. Because I am obsessed with cats. I started noticing that he ALWAYS grabbed that cup, and he would go out of his way to wash it if it was dirty. There‚Äôs nothing really interesting about posting a photo of a cup - so that‚Äôs another sweet thing that doesn‚Äôt get posted. 

The point of sharing my story is that I‚Äôve been there. I have some self esteem issues, coupled with anxiety. Sometimes it gets to me. And for a while, I lived with some sort of resentment towards my relationship because it didn‚Äôt look like the ones I saw online. But I am so glad I was able to realize the few points I mentioned at the beginning of my post. The minute I stopped comparing and accepting that my partner just simply isn‚Äôt one of those people who posts on socials, I started realizing and loving my relationship more genuinely. I know I am setting myself up for snarky comments, but I know a lot of people deal with this insecurity. I am here to tell you that your feelings are valid, but once you readjustment your mindset, you may start to see things more clearly.",I used to feel the same way. But relationships really don‚Äôt need to be online. They are personal and intimate. Anyone who knows me in real life knows exactly how my boyfriend treats me. They see it. But those special moments are just for us. My boyfriend is very private. He rarely posts in social media at all let alone about us and that‚Äôs fine. Social media isn‚Äôt real life.

It really just can‚Äôt be that every single woman out there is dating out of their league - most women (myself included) don‚Äôt even think super highly of themselves, let alone have the confidence or looks to date out of our league. It seems to me like this response has become a cop out to avoid accountability. I have my own thoughts on what else could be going on, but I‚Äôd really like to hear other ideas on what could be going on to drive so many eligible young women off the apps and out of dating.

EDIT: by issues I mean mistreatment & disrespect, having trouble finding dates or finding people who want relationships, etc.","Girl this is Reddit.  About 70% of users are men, it‚Äôs one of the most misogynistic places on the internet. And most of the men who post on dating subs are the bitter ones who think every woman wants someone over 6 ft and tons of money. The men who have had success have no reason to come on to those subs. They also think that like only 5 guys get all the attention from women. They also think that women should love it that men want us for sex, even though it makes most of us feel like an object not worth any value. Don‚Äôt let the men of Reddit get to you, they‚Äôre not representative of the men in the real world."
dating,jbqt0s,2020-10-15 16:24:18,Why does excitement or being eager always seem to result in ghosting or one sided conversation?,"Is it just me or does anyone else feel as if, the moment you express excitement or hint that you'd like to get together with someone they ghost you? 

I don't get it.  I'm fairly attractive from what my friends tell me, I think I can hold a conversation well, I seem to be a semi well rounded individual, and yet 99% of the time when I've been talking to a woman for a few days/week or two they just ghost me.  And this is after a nice back and forth has been established, we seem to have similarities and get along.  And then either just before or just after I say ""hey can I get you a drink sometime?"" it's radio silence.

Anyone else experience this on a regular basis?  Or am I just crazy/doing something wrong.

Most recent one was me chatting with a woman for about a week, things seemed to line up beautifully.  We made each other laugh, had a fair amount in common and then just radio silence.  So I deleted my tinder account and the app for the 10th time in the last few years.  I feel broken and distraught, like giving up is my only option.","I don't get this ngl, the only guys who really understand how this works is fuck boys or guys looking for a hook up. Most guys who want a simple relationship or smth like that tend to be pretty honest and say that outright or tend to hint about it. 

Open question but why act like this, where they demand this game of don't show interest even tho you're interested to make me interested. When most decent people would either move on leaving only the fuck boys or the creeps."

For guys it‚Äôs even worse because your self esteem gets utterly crushed. You go on apps and swipe on 500+ women and get NO matches","I used to feel this way because I would go into every date with expectations. This person could be the one so I can't mess it up.

Eventually, I came to realize you're meeting people, just people, and connecting maybe over food or an activity. Learning something new and having a good time, letting go of any ideas for future and living in the present. If it goes bad, you've got a story to tell next time around.

And why would they think I would go to their home and do the same??? Stranger danger. Smh I'm not trusting someone I never met before in a space alone. Especially not my home.

Also, I am not into anyone who can't be more exciting than wanting to chill inside the house. At least start off on a more exciting foot.

Lastly, if the person is trying to hook up I prefer for them to be forward and not waste their time with this tactic with me.",Honestly these guys just want sex. I see no other reason why someone would suggest that. Unless you lack complete common sense.
dating,wpfmp2,2022-08-16 00:25:43,Ghosted after saying Big Bang theory is dumb.,"So the girl I recently started dating & thought I was hitting it off with pretty well seems to have ghosted me after I said The Big Bang Theory was stupid. 

I see this as a win, I don‚Äôt think I could have gotten a better story out of it than this. üòÇ


EDIT: wow this silly post got a lot more traction than I expected, and a lot of you seem out to disparage me. If you guys actually want context I‚Äôve give you some, It‚Äôs not that deep. 

First of all I didn‚Äôt actually say it was stupid, or dumb, or imply anything about her intelligence or belittle her in any way. Second I doubt it‚Äôs the real reason and honestly calling it ghosting is a bit of a stretch in the first place. We had been -dating- as I said. We had met up, discussed interests, had a lot in common, had a rapport even. She liked some shows I didn‚Äôt care about,  she didn‚Äôt care for some of mine. It‚Äôs not a big deal to like different things. 
We had been talking less often over the course of a week, just drifting apart I guess, circumstances and all that. 
The last thing she said was she was tired of watching Big Bang theory even though she loved it and wanted to play on her computer more. I responded by saying I couldn‚Äôt stand the show, and computer sounds more fun anyway.  The end. 

I thought it would be funny to say that was the reason, because; my final point, that show is bad. 
It‚Äôs insensitive, misogynistic, offensive and most of all deeply unfunny. I do not like that show. If you like it in spite of these things then I‚Äôm going to take note of that.  
It‚Äôs not a dealbreaker in any way, people can like things. Even problematic things, if they can understand & separate it from its issues. A guilty pleasure, or what have you. 
Oh and the rest of the comments were jokes too, I thought that was clear. Last Thursdayism is silly. Shrimp being unacceptable? Silly. Apparently these are evidence if being an a** to some people. Anyway. 

Have a nice day üëç","Oh ok, we are talking about the show‚Ä¶."

dating,qkh5xb,2021-11-01 16:02:46,"I talked with 8 girls in the club, and I'm really proud of it","So my freinds and I went to the club on Halloween. My goal for the night was to talk to at least one girl in order to grow more confidence when approaching girls. I approached around 8 girls in total and I was shocked at how simple it really is, asking random questions or giving compliments sparked conversations with all of those girls. Funny thing is that before approaching any of those girls I was a bit scared ngl, but when we started talking everything ran smooth and they were engaged in the conversation.

I'm quite proud of myself, as before COVID started I never approached, I was too shy to approach, but now my attitude towards dating and approaching has drastically changed, and I'm doing things that I had never done before. Now I'm taking approaching and dating as it is, as a game.

dating,k8hzcp,2020-12-07 14:52:18,I think I've dodged a bullet,"Hi guys,

Really wanted to offload this off my chest and see what your thoughts were...

So I've been on 3 dates with this very attractive girl. I thought we got on very well and conversation was great. Kissed/made out a few times, all good. Then I got to hear a bit more about her rather checkered dating history which I was surprised she shared to me about (was keen to roll with so as not to be too judgemental). In all dates I've paid for dinner and drinks (I did ask her but each time would obviously look like she isn't keen to and was expecting to be paid for). After each of the first 2 dates she would text soon after thanking me for a lovely evening, sweet emojis, ya-da, and would sound interested in my job etc.

Date 3 and she interestingly initiated this with tickets to a museum (which turned out to be free, but appreciated the thought anyway). Afterwards we went for dinner then drinks and normal ""service"" resumed (ie me paying for it). Then in the middle of drinks in the bar she says her friend (who did call her like 10 times) has insisted that she goes meet her now to help wing her to get together with a dude her friend likes bla-bla, and had to go and essentially bailed out on me. 

No texts or apology afterwards. Sent a ""feeler"" text 2 days later (which I'm glad I did, as I considered just no longer texting) only for her to reply within 15 minutes ""I had a great night dancing with them until early hours"". WTAF. No reply needed. Blocked and deleted.","Probably get downvoted to Hell for this but I feel someone should tell you some harsh truthes.

While I don't condone her actions, I do believe you have some fault in this situation/scenario.

First of all just because you find her attractive doesn't give her leway to act in such a manner. If she were ""normal"" or less attractive would you have expected different results or have been less forgiving? Her level of attraction to you should not change the way you interact with her or any woman.

You really need to set some standards for yourself. Make it clear what will and will not be allowed from people you are dating. I used to let shit like this slide but I haven't for some time.

I recently had a first date where the girl was glued to her phone from the time we met until about 15 minutes in when I walked out (honestly too long but I was giving her the benefit of the doubt). All attempts at conversation were rebuffed with tart answers and any lack of respect. I bought out coffes and the she didn't even ackowledge this or thank me for doing so. I refused to be an ornament in her environment.

Suffice to say had you made it clear, in a respectful way, that if she left that night on the third date it would be the last, you might not be posting here at all. She would have respected your honesty most likely and apologized. You would be demonstrating your values and that her time with you and your choice to spend both time and money on her is not to be taken with such disregard. And if she had still left you wouldn't have needed to bother wondering for another two days and texting her as you would have found your answer.

This brings me to point two. You can't get mad for paying when you invited her and chose the activity. No matter who pays the other person is not owed anything just because they paid. There is no ""service"" as you called it.

In my coffee date above I wasn't angry for buying her coffee and being ignored. I always pay for first dates, and expect nothing from them. This is why I usually do something cheap and easy to walk away from. 

You're angry you bought dinners and got nothing out of it. Were you expecting to get laid because you were buying dinners? If you don't want to spend money on expensive stuff then don't invite them to expensive dates. That simple. It would be nice if they offered to chip in, and some do, but if they don't ask them to. We're long past this men pay everything trope. Ask them to cover the next venue or date. Going on fancy dinner dates this early is just asking for trouble."

dating,gn9q0k,2020-05-20 11:33:27,Beware Of Love Bombing,"I have been reading about ladies using the level of texting to tell whether a guy is into them or not but sometimes this isn't always true. Some guys in the very beginning will text you from morning to evening, say all the right words, compliment you day and night, send you all the beautiful songs etc and then when you are in so deep they will either ghost you or withdrawal which inturn will drive your crazy wondering what you did wrong, you will start apologising for things you didn't do and guess what, you will blame yourself for being too clingy and for messing up something so perfect! 

But you weren't in the wrong at all, some people use it as technique to get what they want by being the perfect prince charming, they will even plan the future with you and make you feel like they are the one! When it takes even longer or seems like they won't get it, they will ghost or withdrawal completely. It is never about you, its about them winning the game. 

So as you get so excited about him texting you every minute and thinking he can't get enough of you, ask yourself important questions? Listen to your intuition, if something is too good to be true, it often isn't true. 

Someone can text you all day because they are bored not because they can't get enough! Someone will text you twice a week because they are generally busy but they do really like you and want to know you! Also a word of advice stalking someone to see if they are online is unhealthy and will lead you to madness. Learn to know the person you are dealing with and don't let texting be the measure of how much that person loves you! There are so many ways to know someone loves you besides texting and the ultimate is being straight up and asking them.

This applies to both ladies and gentlemen. I hope it speaks to someone out there.","You're not wrong. But maybe women and men should stop using frequency of texting as a metric from the get go. People are still people. They deserve to not have to check in or text all day long without fear of of being seen as not interested despite any other signals. Being in contact with ANYONE 24/7 is exhausting. Let me work at work without having to feel like a job texting you on top of work. That doesn't mean I'm not interested. It means I'm at work and you aren't the most important thing at that moment. That's okay. Don't make me tell you what I'm doing at all times. What are we going to talk about when I see you if I've told you everything as it was happening. Yeah a text is great but you know what's better? Being able to tell you the same story in person using my hands, my voice, expressions. Not words on a screen that take away all nuance. So how about instead of ""you're not wrong when they don't text as much and are justified in being upset"" we have ""let them be them and don't make talking to you feel like a job and allow them to be who they are"""

I drink occassionally and my friends drink, but my past 2 girlfriends were both really into drinking. One pushed me to drink and would get angry at me if I didn't. The last one specifically bordered on alcohol abuse, which then led into me being emotionally mistreated by her on multiple occasions. Tbh, it kind of left me gun-shy of girls that drink really heavily and who always seem to need a drink in their hand. Unfortunately, that seems to be a lot of people in my age group.

After my last relationship, I'm embracing more of the attitude of ""my future wife's mindset will influence our children more than how she looks"" and ""if I wouldn't want my future kid treating people a certain way, I shouldn't date someone who treats people that way.""

I guess at my core, I'm just tired of being in a generation where people treat each other like they're disposable and where hookup culture runs rampant.

dating,hnumm7,2020-07-09 02:10:02,I Went On Such An Awkward Date....,"I need to get this off my chest somewhere. Lol.
I‚Äôm on a cell, ignore the mistakes pls! So sorry in advance.

I met a guy on Tinder I thought seemed really cool! We chatted from daylight to dark it seemed, and had a lot in common. He was a single father, out of a divorce for a year. He told me why the previous marriages ended. 

Restrictions have lifted quite a bit in my state, so we agreed to meet. I‚Äôm actually in a county with barely a handful of cases.
Anyways, I offered to meet halfway. According to the app he was 78 miles away. He said no, he‚Äôd happily drive to {insert county} Bc he had kids in another state, and he was so use to driving! It didn‚Äôt bother him, no big deal!

So we meet, he wasn‚Äôt quite what I expected. I was okay with that though. I suggested we go eat, I wasn‚Äôt sure what else to do.
So we ordered, and convo seems to be going great and just flowing. Food comes, we eat. Towards the end the waitress lays our check on the table. Several minutes pass. He didn‚Äôt touch nor look at the check. She walked by maybe 5-6 times.
Finally I say ‚Äúwell guess I‚Äôll have to get this‚Äù and handed her my card. She walks away and he said ‚Äúoh do you expect cash or something for that?‚Äù He had a $10 in his hand. I do want to add, my meal was $9.99, my drink, I had about $13 on a $58 ticket. So yes he ordered an expensive steak dinner. So of course I wasn‚Äôt too thrilled. I said ‚Äúoh well I guess you don‚Äôt have to if you don‚Äôt want to?‚Äù I‚Äôm too polite I know!! He shoves his money back in his pocket Bc he ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt want to‚Äù

After this we drive. I didn‚Äôt know what else to do. I was trying to be nice Bc he did drive quite a distance.
I need to add - He kept mentioned a hotel when he first got in. Even mentioned it on messages. How big it was etc.
I didn‚Äôt think too much about it. So I finally go back to his car and park. I said ‚Äúwell! I think I should be getting home to my kiddos.‚Äù But he kept mentioning the hotel. Was the pool open? It looked so nice. He had absolutely nothing at all to do the next day. He had to drive that far, it was him that drove that far and now he had to drive all the way back, maybe he should get a room.
He pulls out his phone and logs into a bank app, I assume. He starts saying ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know where my money goes‚Äù then starts naming things down the list. He says gas like 4 times. He‚Äôs like ‚ÄúI mean I‚Äôm the one that had to drive‚Äù I said ‚Äúyes I offered to meet you closer, you said numerous times you would rather come here.‚Äù He said ‚Äúwell my account is at 17, I don‚Äôt like it going below $15 but I really need a room Bc I had to drive and pay for gas‚Äù I‚Äôm not sure if he meant $1500 and $1700 or $15 and $17. Lol. I didn‚Äôt ask.
This was so awkward to me. I began to think about this. Did he want me to pay for a room for him?? What was he expecting.?? I was so confused.
I said 3 more times, well I had better get back home and pick up my kids, I have to work early tomorrow.
‚ÄúWell I have absolutely nothing at all to do tomorrow and I had to drive here.‚Äù
We had sat here for about 3 hours with him saying he ‚Äúloved my thick thighs‚Äù and kept touching my hair. He said he loved short hair Bc he could ‚Äúpull on it‚Äù and grabbed the back of my head. Then he‚Äôd start again ‚Äúyou think that pool is open at the hotel?‚Äù Of course I didn‚Äôt know. Then ‚Äúgosh I‚Äôd really love to have a room tonight‚Äù he said this maybe 4-5 times.

On the way home I began thinking. He had asked such odd questions, I don‚Äôt know why I didn‚Äôt notice before.
Like he asked what my parents did. Asked at a random time, not during a convo about their jobs or anything like that.
He also asked how much money I made, and if I currently had money. He also Complained about his ex wife never working and having to be the sole provider. He just got so fed up and couldn‚Äôt take it. That seemed like too much detail for me, esp to someone you don‚Äôt really know.

It was such an awkward and awful experience for me!! It makes dating so depressing!
I just needed to vent!",Honestly I‚Äôm just so glad you got home safely

dating,eocpbc,2020-01-13 23:51:04,"I meet a girl who is a complete geek on all things geeky 5 months ago, and it's going so well. It makes it all much more easier for dating.","I'm a 23 year old Black male, and she's 24 year old Colombian woman.

It's going so well, and the energy hasn't died down at all since we started to date. I always had a hard time getting a girlfriend, and got rejected a whole bunch of times. Even when I did had one, they all ended even when I tried my best to save it.

But this girl is different. I was just going through GameStop, and I was geeking out over a pokeball popcorn machine. She was actually just about to leave till she saw how excited I was. I didn't cause a disturbance, I was just really excited that it's in store finally. She approached me first, and talk about Pokemon. She even brought her 3ds, and we traded Pokemon. It was awesome that happened because soon after she wanted to hangout with me at a pizza place.

We did went to the pizza place(Stevie B's pizza), and had a awesome time getting to know each other a little bit more. It wasn't until we left she texted me she would like to go on a date. I was flabbergasted about it, but I was nonetheless excited. On the day we went on the date, everything changed. I was shy, so I tried to start small talk. I wasn't good, but I did my best. But it wasn't till she asked me my favorite superhero that we enjoyed each other company. I said Superman, and she said which one. I said Kingdom come, and she said red son Superman. After that, we talked about many geeky stuff so long we realized a hour passed because we were having a good time enjoying each other company.

Fast forward to now; We cook foods from cartoons, anime, and video games. We talk about geeky stuff up to 8 hour's sometimes. We even went on a date to a planetarium, zoo, and astronaut museum. For the first, I'm not awkward to a girl who enjoys my company. Rather she adores my company because she's able to be super geeky around me. We're open to each, we play fighting games together, we watch cartoon/anime movies together. It's so awesome and relieving to meet a lady that's as geeky as this.

My tip to all the shy geeky guy's. If you find a super geeky lady where she can geek out with you, and enjoy your company, you can definitely make a relationship work if you be yourself. This is so awesome, and I'm so happy.","Currently working on a beautiful geek myself, only problem is we're both not that long out of big relationships so patience is key."

dating,urczi9,2022-05-17 03:03:25,The reason terrible men seem so common - terrible men have much more reach,"One consistent things I've heard from my female friends is that terrible men seem to be everywhere, whereas good men are rare to find.  This is quite an interesting contrast to my worldview, because most of my guy friends are decent people and in happy relationships.   After thinking about this for awhile, I realized that this actually makes sense, for a few reasons.

&#x200B;

1. Desirable, single men will be taken out of the dating pool at a much higher rate then undesirable single men.   So in the pool of single men, the good ones will be outnumbered by the bad ones, regardless of whether good men in general are outnumbered by bad ones.
2. A single good men can only make 1 woman happy at a time.   A terrible one will reach hundreds through any dating app, and send toxic messages to all of them.   In other words, it takes a hundred times the number of good men to balance out one bad one in terms of perception from the other gender.
3. Online dating apps that use ranking algorithms will siphon everyone towards the top percentile of profiles, whereas everyone else's profiles generally gets rarely shown.   For the people who have the most photogenic / have the highest ranked profiles, the great ones will be taken off the market relatively quickly, and most remaining ones will be ones not looking for commitment.

These 3 factors combined means that it'll always appear as if good men are exponentially rare, regardless of whether this is actually the case (it may be, I don't know, but it won't matter).","Terrible men dont feel themselves bound by the same morals, norms, or anxieties that others have

dating,afs1am,2019-01-14 04:22:53,There are good men out there,"I accidentally drank too much on a second date last night. The night was long and the drinks were constant. I swore I was feeling fine, a little buzzed, and then all of a sudden it hit me like a sack of bricks.

I was in no place to be taking the train home alone. My date, one of the kindest guys I‚Äôve ever gone out with, asked if I would be ok to take the train home. He was concerned for my safety and, based on prior interactions, I could tell this concern was genuine. 

He offered to let me stay at his place. I was reluctant, but it beat the alternative of going on the train and the possibility of falling asleep and missing my stop. He promised he would do whatever was needed to make sure I was safe and comfortable.

I decided to go and I said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll go with you bc I feel like you‚Äôre a good guy.‚Äù And he said, ‚ÄúI hope I can SHOW YOU that I am.‚Äù 

That night, he did everything possible to make sure I was ok. Kept bringing me water, gave me something to eat, got me medicine, sat with me and talked to me. He even got out his guitars and we played music and sang together. He didn‚Äôt pull anything weird or try to instigate anything remotely sexual. He stayed up the whole night with me. The next morning, he got me a bagel and went out to get me Advil. 

I share this because, GIRLS - I want to reiterate that there are decent guys out there. And I know, I KNOW, it seems like the world is scary and so many cannot be trusted; but, rest assured, genuinely good people exist. And more men should follow this example.

AITA?","So basically I matched with this girl on Hinge and (after what felt like pulling teeth), finally planned a first date. I show up on time and text her ""I'm here."" She immediately replies saying she's going to be 12 minutes late without an apology or excuse. Half an hour later, she finally shows up, and I say ""you're 30 minutes late, I don't think this is going to work,"" and I turned around and left. She texted me saying ""dang, sorry I had trouble finding parking. Glad we find out earlier that we don't mesh well.""Did I do the right thing? I truly believe we have to value our time and ourselves, and by staying, it basically enables people to disrespect you.

Edit: It seems a lot of people are making assumptions about my character lol. Fair enough based on the limited info I provided. Here are my follow-up thoughts. What I mean by pulling teeth to plan a date was she kinda give off high maintenance vibes. I initially asked her out to drinks on a week night and she said she doesn't drink on weeknights but is free, so I said OK let's do ice cream instead and she said she already recently had ice cream etc.  
I really do value punctuality (independent of dating) and I actually am a pretty easy going person for the most part, but being late is my biggest pet peeve. Imagine showing up 30 minutes late to a job interview, let alone without a good explanation. How late is too late? I feel like 30 minutes is pretty forgiving. Should I have just texted her and left instead? I felt as though if I had stuck it out through the date it would've been a waste of time as the vibe was already off, and I certainly wasn't going to ask her on a second date.","I mean you did what you did, doesn‚Äôt matter what we think üòÇ"

I'm (25m) seeing a (27f) and this is the first girl I've ever been with, let alone to even try to take on a date. I kinda knew when I first met her I just knew she's the one. I'm still a virgin myself. Not that this changes much. 

She ended up staying over last night after maybe seeing her multiple times over 5\~ months. She told me she's not ready for sex, which I'm kinda glad she told me as I was getting vibes from her and sending them to her. If she didn't tell me, I wouldn't have known. I can now understand what people mean by communication and going slow. It's much more intimate this way, way more flirting. 

Honestly women are just like us in many ways, you have the ones that just want a quick fuck and the others that want to take things slow, get to know you.

Hard for me to explain, confidence comes from being able to be yourself around her and vise versa. Some are just more open then others, I'm very shy, especially around women. I say the wrong things at the start, choke on my words if I don't know them lol. 

I honestly didn't expect this to even happen, it was more natural and just kinda happened. I messaged her too much at the start, then I moved to only messaging her once or twice a week. 

Honestly just made out all night and cuddled, talked in the morning while just rolling around all hung over.

I just went through a phase with drug use because I felt like I was never good enough, never had that confidence around someone. Felt like (25m) my right hand was all I had. I don't even think about porn whenever. I'm around her for days after, I don't have an urge to get myself off, even though we don't have sex. 

Online apps are terrible imho. Talking in person is the best interaction you can have.

I went on a date with someone two nights ago who told me that he wasn‚Äôt looking to get into a serious relationship straightaway, just that he wanted to meet someone and go on adventures together to see if they were compatible, and that he enjoyed being single.

I enjoy being single too, but that‚Äôs because I get that time alone. I don‚Äôt want to waste it with someone who isn‚Äôt ready for a serious relationship anymore. 

So I told him immediately after the date that I didn‚Äôt want to see him again. He told me that he was shocked and that I should see him again. I said no thanks.

Edit: I don‚Äôt want an instant relationship. I am totally fine to get to know someone over a few weeks or months. But I‚Äôm not interested in spending my time with someone who enjoys being single while they decide if they‚Äôre ready for a relationship.

I [24 F] have rejected so many guys in the past because they were ""too short"". But to be completely honest, I feel like this was due to social pressure and just a toxic dating environment amongst the sorority I used to be involved in. 

Whenever I would talk about guys with any of my friends, one of the first questions they would always ask me is ""Is he hot? Is he tall? Let me see a picture of him!""

I always felt like these sorts of questions were just so shallow, but I played it off like it was nothing in order to fit in.

Anyways, I recently left my sorority and have started having healthier dating interactions with men. I am currently seeing a guy who is about 2 inches shorter than me! We are going on our 4th date tomorrow! I feel like this was the best decision I ever made. He makes me feel the way I want to feel, and I don't need to approval of any of my friends/family. Am I so quick to jump the gun and just assume that he's ""the one""?. Probably, that's why I'm not holding my breath. But what I can say is that out of all of the men that I've interacted with, the one I'm seeing currently has by far treated me the best. 

All I can say is that I'm so glad not to be caught up in petty things like a man's height anymore. Yes, I'm slightly more attracted to taller men, but so what? The more I get to know someone, the more attracted to them I become, and everything else seems so petty.

Valued bonds for what they are, realistic appraisal of strengths and weaknesses. Good intentions. If dating doesn‚Äôt work out, the motives and intentions already set a tone of respect and appreciation. Leading to true friendship if so desired. 

In addition to that, every long term relationship I‚Äôve had since has resulted in life long friends. Im not in constant communication with these exes but were I to reach out for some specific advice or insight etc , they‚Äôd be there for me and vice versa. To be able to honour relationships in this way has also taken the pressure off forcing something that isn‚Äôt meant to be more. 

Show up as a friend, and be open to more should it arise. Watch how people not only flock to you but enjoy you and appreciate you for letting them be who and as they are.

I wasn't being condescending, I wasn't even really directing how I get my news at her or telling her how to get her news.  But she insisted I had mansplained.  So I asked her what would it look like if I girlsplained it to her.

Check please!  Dodged a bullet, but it was so disappointing.  We as a society are overreacting to literally everything nowadays.

'Very well', I said 'I will leave you to it.'

Do you ask follow up questions? Do you use language that makes you sound interested?

Is the other person holding up the conversation?

Do you actually know how to hold up a conversation?","I ask a lot of questions and always push to keep the conversation going. 
What I hate most is when you ask a question and you‚Äôre left with a reply. No follow up. At the very least you could reply with a ‚Äòhow about you?‚Äô after you‚Äôve answered something I‚Äôve asked. 
How simple is that, not even having to think up your own question. But yet that seems too complex for some people to comprehend."
dating,hehcv1,2020-06-23 16:05:47,Do very attractive people get treated differently? Almost frowned upon? Serious question o,"A friend of mine who is perfect looking, with amazing facial features were talking about it today about dating and she mentioned she gets judged very easily because of her looks. For example, she is interested in someone who most would say isn't each others type. She said the people she dates have had the other persons friends reach out to her and ask what her motive was,
Gold digging, cat fishing etc ( basically saying what are you doing with that person). And I'm genuinely curious to if anyone else experiences this. We also talked about how most girls frown upon her for no reason, can people just simply dislike a person because they are to good looking?","Attractive people do get passes and special treatment for being attractive, yes. It's often assumed that attractive people wouldn't be seeking out people who are less attractive than them by a large margin so people become skeptical when it actually happens.

Also, people of the same sex can be intimidated by very attractive peers. Those girls are basically jealous of your friend. That's why they're treating her poorly. It happens."

I asked her out for a coffee and it was just super easy she seemed really excited to see me.

So I went out with her today and I just really liked so much about her, she even paid for her and my coffee when I insisted on paying the bill she just beat me to it and said it was her treat. I was just so taken aback, I'm so used to girls always expecting me to pay the bills so I was so just so flattered and couldn't stop thanking her over and over lol. She's also really into cooking and was super easy to talk to asking me about my childhood, my thoughts on life etc. And I just told her she is so unbelievably cool and I've never met someone where's there been such an instant connection with.

We went back to her place and she hugged me goodbye and told me she would like to see me again, I don't want to get my hopes up as she could just be saying that just to be nice. She texted me a couple hours ago saying she had a fun time so then I asked her out again and offered to take her to a petting zoo lol since she loves animals.

I‚Äôve (24F) been seeing this guy (25M) for a few months now. He‚Äôs an absolute sweetheart, very thoughtful, and amazing.

But I asked him and he said that it‚Äôs to make sure I leave safely. 

I have never dated thoughtful, respectful, or nice men before. So this caught me off guard. I‚Äôm not sure where he learned to be so sweet but I love it. Most of the men I have been in relationships with would let me walk home alone in the dark after a date or night out, and not check in to make sure I got home safely (I‚Äôd always be the one to text them to make sure they got home). So the fact that this man is sweet enough to make sure I leave parking lots safely and we haven‚Äôt made it official yet strikes me as very wholesome.

dating,fqjqpt,2020-03-28 12:59:32,Dating is Time-Consuming ‚Äì 5 Tips Women Need to Stop Wasting Time,"Dating is time-consuming.

Suppose, you're dating a confident and successful guy. But he's in a bad mood all the time. You put up with it, thinking that you‚Äôll change him. Until finally, you get fed up and break up with him.

And then you regret the time lost.

Here's how you can stop wasting your time right now.


## Tip 1: Build a solid foundation with values

Let's say you meet a guy and he seems great. But then you realize he's dishonest. That's a clear sign the guy is wasting your time. Dishonesty isn't a good place to start.

What do you need for an amazing relationship? *A solid foundation.* But how do you build it exactly? You need to know your values and make sure they match those of your romantic partner.

To understand your values, ask yourself questions like these:

¬∑ What kind of a family do I want?

¬∑ How important is communication to me?

¬∑ How much integrity and self-discipline do I expect from a partner?

¬∑ How much negativity can I tolerate?

Now, you need a guy with similar values.

## Tip 2: Don't idealize him

Let me use Robin Williams as an example.

He married his first wife, Valerie, at 26. Soon, Valerie realized he couldn't be faithful to her.

But she idealized him:

*He's the great Robin Williams and I can live with his infidelity, I guess.*

But that was her head making the choice. Whereas in her heart, she knew she was betraying herself. And they got a divorce eventually.

That said, you might meet a great guy. He's confident, successful, and funny. But there's still something you don't like about him. Don't idealize him for those good qualities to avoid time-consuming dating.

*Listen not just to your head but also to your heart.*

## Tip 3: Don't change him

Suppose, a guy you're dating says he can't commit to a relationship right now. But he's great otherwise.

And you think, ‚ÄúI can change him. I'll make him commit.‚Äù

They say that people don't change. I believe they do but only as long as they want it. Just because you want him to change doesn't mean that he will.

That said, I respect you for the willingness to help him change. Feeling your support is very important for a man. It helps him build a business or career and also grow personally. But why waste your energy on someone who doesn't care?

*Save it for the right person!*

## Tip 4: Don't go along because you want to be nice

Let me illustrate with an example of a girl who had a suppressive father.

He would get angry often. And she learned to be nice to him in those moments. Otherwise, he wouldn't have loved her‚Äîa scary thought for a little girl.

Now in her early thirties, she met a guy who was strong, confident, and aggressive. This guy would get angry with her just as her father did. And without much thinking, she was nice to him in those moments as well. That was her default behavior learned in childhood.

But after a while, her resentment got so huge that she couldn't take it anymore. And she broke up with him. But with dating being so time-consuming, she lost so much time.

*So, don't be nice when it feels wrong.*

Ask yourself:

¬∑ Am I being unreasonably nice to my partner?

¬∑ Can I stop going along with what I don't like?

¬∑ How do I be more assertive about what I need?

¬∑ How can I set my boundaries and keep them up?

## Tip 5: Let him know and let him go

If you don't like something about a guy you're dating, you've got to let him know. And if he doesn't want to change, let him go.

Let's say he doesn't want to commit to a relationship. Sit down with him and talk about it.

Use this formula from *How to Have a Good Day* by Caroline Webb:

¬∑ Warmth

¬∑ Explanation

¬∑ Offering an alternative

¬∑ Ending with warmth

Here's what you can say:

### Warmth

Thank you for being a great boyfriend.

I love how gentle and loving you are.

I want our relationship to work.

### Explanation

I need you to commit to the relationship.

If you can do it, I'll be the happiest girl ever.

### Offering an alternative

If you feel you can't, I'll respect that.

It'll break my heart but it'll be the right thing to do.

### Ending with warmth

Thank you for coming into my life.

I adore you.

### How you'll feel

As a result, you'll feel better. And you'll also feel inner peace.

You did what's right and now you can trust the universe to figure out what's best for you.

If he's right for you, he'll come back.

## Now, I want to turn it over to you

Which of these tips will you use to stop wasting time?

¬∑ Is it building a solid foundation with values?

¬∑ Or not hoping that he'll change?

No, not a cute stubble‚Ä¶ like the lawn after the first spring rain. Already committed to the outfit, I had a mild panick as I realized that there was no turning back.

The date went fantastic. He is a great dude with a great sense of humor. Haven't told him about this yet but I think he will thoroughly enjoy it on date #2.

dating,rxv1nm,2022-01-07 01:37:04,$2.5k for a first date?,"So this may sound crazy, because it kinda is.
I (33m), have been single for about 2 years now, and covid hasn't exactly helped with that, but during lockdown i met this girl (25) online who lives in a completely different continent.
We talked so much and definitely developed a thing, and i just haven't really been able to connect with a girl so much for so damn long! To me she's perfect! At least from what i know.
I'd put a ring on her without second thought!
Now i'm planning to go see her, which we are both very excited about, and i'm only gonna be able to see her for a weekend, and tickets (24 hours of travel each way) + hotel and expenses will incur a cost in the vicinity of $2.5k.
Now, i'm happy to put that time and money into it, because the way i see it, it's not everyday or even every year that you find someone that's amazing, but on the other hand, i have no idea how i'm gonna navigate through this.
If i go and we don't wanna move forward, that will be such a waste of money, and if i go and we can't stay away from each other, then that's a lot of heartache and uncertainty! As i can't  go there every other week, neither can i just ask her to move to my country or me to hers. Help!

EDIT: Thank you redditors! I did not imagine this would blow up this way! But just to note:
She is very real, we do calls, video calls, i see her daily IG story, etc.
I will not just dive head in into a marriage with this person, a lot of hard questions and more time will be spent together before i can even think about that.
Also, i was the one to suggest the trip to see her, and i've decided to go ahead with it, and just treat it as a mini vacation, with the potential of happiness on the side, or not! Will post an update once i do make the trip, if i do.
I also need the adventure this will be, last year at least has been really dull with all the lockdowns.
If you're a guy in the same situation, please do be careful, a lot of scammers are out there, and being safe is your top priority. Do not ignore red flags, look for the green flags, and maybe consult the good people here.

dating,djbefd,2019-10-17 19:34:06,Can we please stop pretending that men are the only ones capable of being terrible?,"Two years ago I dated a woman who was a cousin of one of my friends. We met at a birthday party and I asked her out. We hit it off. She had just gotten out of a relationship, but was fine with dating me. We got along great. Had the same interests, texted or saw each other everyday, etc.. I took her out to dinners and beach trips, all paid for by me cause she was broke and had no job. I did everything for this person and I wasnt expecting anything in return besides a little respect and gratitude. I even found her a job and helped her with a car payment at one point. Shortly after helping her find a job she came to me with ""I dont want to be intimate with you anymore, because I feel like I'm not over my ex still"". My response was that I was fine with it. She suggested proceeding as friends and I agreed. Then a week later I find her tinder profile advertising to do the very same activities she was doing with me the last few months. She also had been making mild comments about dating other guys when we would hang out. I called her out on her shit and the chaos that ensued ended my friendship with her and my mutual friend. She basically tried to claim that I only wanted to be friends so that I could date her again at some point. She also(conveniently) never paid me back some money I had lent her and started ghosting me. The irony is that on social media, people praise her for being strong and independent and I'm treated like the asshole. I wish that she had just told me why she really wanted to stop dating me and start seeing other guys. Ladies please, if you're gonna stop dating a guy, please be honest about why. How are we ever supposed to improve if you cant be honest about what went wrong or didnt click?

Tl;dr woman used me as a rebound and I'm considered the asshole.

Edit: Gonna clarify a few things since people dont read/misinterpret things. I dated this person for 3 months. She joked about dating other guys a week AFTER we stopped dating, which was a flag for me considering that the reason she wanted to stop seeing me was supposedly that she wasnt over her ex. Also, this person was doing a myriad of other things in an attempt to string me along. Such as complaining about why I dont text her every day anymore the week after we stopped dating.","I'm pretty sure that no one on the outside looking in would praise this woman. I can understand your frustration completely, but I'm not convinced that blaming her gender is going to help you resolve your feelings in any way. Women are people, so some are bound to be pieces of shit. I'm very sorry you dated one. I hope you find someone better in the future who you can be happy with."
dating,cjy4ko,2019-07-30 21:08:31,I [25F] went on the most perfect first date and I‚Äôm afraid to tell anyone because I don‚Äôt want to jinx it.,"I replied to a guy who id been following for a while‚Äôs instagram story of a meal he was having saying the restaurant he was at was my favorite. We talked for a week or two and he asked me if he could take me out on a date and show me his favorite.

For some reason the day of the date I was excited instead of the usual nervousness. I met him at his job and we took the subway to the restaurant. He ordered his favorite meals (nearly half the menu) and we shared a bottle of wine.

He joked about not liking small talk and I suggested we pretend like it‚Äôs our third date instead of our first. We then talked about some pretty serious things like family dynamics, my father abandoning me as a child, our past relationships, and everything in between. 

He then told me he wasn‚Äôt looking to mess around, he was looking for something serious that could potentially lead to marriage. Normally I‚Äôd be put off by a statement like that but I wasn‚Äôt. 

The last two guys I dated were so hesitant they didn‚Äôt even want to call our dates ‚Äúdates‚Äù. One of them ghosted me. The other told me he wasn‚Äôt ready for a relationship after months of me trying to define what we were. And here this guy was, telling me exactly what he wanted in a matter of fact way.

We left the restaurant but neither of us wanted to go home so he suggested we go for a walk. He asked me if it was okay if he put his arm around me and I said yes. We walked to a street corner and were waiting to cross the street when he pulled me in closer and kissed me. 

I‚Äôve never felt a kiss like that, I literally didn‚Äôt care that we were kissing in the middle of the street and there were people walking by and watching. He then got me a cab home and told me he was going away for vacation for two weeks on Thursday but that he really wanted to see me one more time before he left. So we agreed to see each other again tomorrow. 

I just have butterflies all day today and I‚Äôm so excited to see him again. I have such a good feeling about this guy, I wish I could explain it without sounding crazy.

EDIT: I knew when I wrote this post, there would be a lot of cynical, Debbie downer comments. I myself am a cynical Debbie downer sometimes. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs just trying to get in your pants‚Äù, ‚Äúhe‚Äôs lying‚Äù... etc.

While these may be true, I‚Äôm sticking with my happy feelings instead. He has done nothing to show me that he‚Äôs lying or that he‚Äôs being sketchy. He has wine and dined me without asking for a single thing in return. He got me a cab home and didn‚Äôt ask to come over. All green flags in my book. 

So I‚Äôm choosing to be happy and excited and bubbly for now. 

And if he turns out to be a horrible, dishonest person, then I‚Äôll cross that bridge when I get there.",That sounds like the perfect date to me. I theres nothing wrong with speaking to close friends about it. I wouldn't worry about the jinx thing just take it slow and just enjoy each others company. Hope it all goes well for you both. Take care
dating,133jizm,2023-04-30 08:19:15,Did I overreact when he asked for nudes?,"TLDR: I texted a guy for a few days. He asked for nudes. I told him I am no longer interested in him. He told me to rethink my actions and be more levelheaded next time because I‚Äôm overreacting and it‚Äôs a red flag

I (24f) am looking for a serious relationship, hopefully one that‚Äôll lead to marriage in a couple years. Lately, I‚Äôve been getting a TON of guys asking for nudes within a day or two of texting them. I usually just block them. I also just block people if they say something rude, especially when they neg me or try to make me jealous lmao. When I was younger, I used to just call them out, they‚Äôd apologize, and we‚Äôd keep talking for awhile until they said something rude again and then I‚Äôd stop talking to them. These days, I just don‚Äôt have the patience to put up with it so I immediately block. I admit I may be too quick to do it

Anyway, I had been texting a guy for 3 days. I wasn‚Äôt that attracted to him but sometimes attraction grows so I decided to give it a shot. And he ended up being really fun to talk to! But I was busy all day today so didn‚Äôt text at all until 11pm. His second text message to me today was immediately jokingly asking for nudes. I should‚Äôve just blocked him but for some reason I didn‚Äôt, and instead I told him I was super turned off by that and good luck to him in his search

At first he was understanding and we parted ways, then 20 minutes later he texted me again. Here‚Äôs how the convo went:

Him: *Also, before I sleep, just wanted to apologize if I came on too strong. I didn‚Äôt intend to make you feel comfortable and honestly was joking around, because I thought that was our vibe, but am sorry regardless. You seem like a sweet girl and deserve the best. In the future please don‚Äôt get so quick to anger without communicating, it‚Äôs a red flag and you might weed out guys with genuinely good intentions. Best wishes and take care*

Me: *Maybe you don‚Äôt get it bc you‚Äôre a guy and don‚Äôt have to deal with this, but I‚Äôve already had 2 guys ask me for nudes just today. It gets old real fast. And the fact that you‚Äôre saying IM the red flag here is lowkey insane. I‚Äôm allowed to stop talking to anyone for any reason, and you asking for nudes is a pretty valid one. Maybe instead of telling girls they‚Äôre the one with a red flag, you could‚Äôve just apologized genuinely*

Him: *I did genuinely apologize. I am also sorry on behalf of other jerks for treating you like that; you‚Äôre much more than just a body. Please reflect when you‚Äôre cooler headed. I feel that you‚Äôre projecting frustrations from others onto me. Guys get nudes for XYZ reasons because we‚Äôre tasked with playfully escalating. I‚Äôve gotten plenty, and most girls do not react how you‚Äôre reacting. I do not want nudes from you (wouldn‚Äôt mind, but don‚Äôt want), because I care to know you better as a person. Kindly reflect on this later and consider a more tactful approach to communication in the future. You‚Äôre an excellent communicator already, and I know you‚Äôll be even better with a more level head. Sweet dreams and take care*

To be honest, I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs wrong to ask for nudes. But I was turned off by the fact that we didn‚Äôt even talk about our day at all before he asked me. And we had only been talking for a couple days. So it feels valid to me to not be interested anymore. But honestly I‚Äôve been blocking a lot of guys lately for asking for nudes, so maybe I am the problem? Even though his text was polite, it just sounded condescending right? I don‚Äôt care about this guy in particular, but I‚Äôm trying to figure out if I‚Äôm being too harsh to guys in general",Schr√∂dinger‚Äôs fuckboy. His request for nudes is simultaneously serious and a joke until the box is opened and the requestee reacts.
dating,ste8h3,2022-02-15 21:43:47,Should I feel bad about my girlfriend‚Äôs Valentine‚Äôs Day spending?,"Primer: started exclusivity on January 1st.  Comparable salaries. Zero conversation about spending limits or boundaries for Valentine‚Äôs Day.

Bought her chocolates ($30), small gift ($60), roses ($40) and took her for dinner ($80). So I‚Äôm into it for about $200.

She ends up spending close to $700 on me!

I have never been spoiled like this before and feel absolutely terrible she spent so much.  My knee jerk reaction is to ‚Äòmake up the difference‚Äô and set boundaries for future ‚Äòevents‚Äô.

Anyone else been in a comparable situation?  What did you do?

dating,oq8sxw,2021-07-23 18:47:41,Men in their 40s who lie about their age on apps,"Recently went out with a guy who claimed to be 30 but was really 44. It was obvious on the first date. I checked his license and saw his true age.

A bunch of guys I see on apps ‚Äúsuper like‚Äù me or ‚Äúsuper swipe‚Äù (I don‚Äôt use Tinder, but use the rose sending function/whatnot), and when I check out their profile, it says ‚Äúactually 42-50, can‚Äôt change the age!‚Äù

You can easily change your age on Hinge, and Bumble lets you start without Facebook now.

I am 28F, and my dating range is 26-36. I have tried dating 10-11 years older, but it‚Äôs always been really awkward and not for me.

It seems like every time I go on Reddit, much is made of older men being able to date younger women. If it were so easy, why do these guys have to lie about their age? 

And I‚Äôve chatted with some of them to see their rationale, and two have told me they only really get dates with women over 35. 

I don‚Äôt get it.

edit: yes women can do this too but I do not date women so I didn‚Äôt experience them lying about their age

Edit 2: Every single man here who has posted they look younger than their age, send me a photo of what you look like! So far, I‚Äôve seen six, and all have looked their age. 

I guessed 4 correctly without being told. Two told me how old they were. From the two who told me, one looked about 2-5 years younger (I‚Äôd guess 32-35 when he was really 37.)

Edit 3: Two more guys sent! One was 35 but looked 40. One was 34 and looked 27, but he had had Botox and microneedling (also he was gay am just wanted to see what I‚Äôd say.)

Edit 4: still no one but the gay guy who has looked younger",They say that they don‚Äôt know how to change the age back but the real question is why did they even use a fake age to begin with?
dating,zq366k,2022-12-19 20:51:48,Gf gave random guy at the bar her number and agreed to hang out.,"I‚Äôm 29M and she‚Äôs 27F

exclusive for just about a year. 

I know you shouldn‚Äôt go looking for trouble but temptation got the better of me and I snooped her phone. 

She met a random guy at a bar like 2-3 weeks ago. She gave him her number and they chatted a bit the next two days. He asked her to hang out and she replied ‚Äúok ü•∞ ‚Äú

Obviously I got pissed at her and confronted her. She started crying and made the excuse ‚Äúwe never met up though, we didn‚Äôt do anything‚Äù 

Even if they didn‚Äôt physically meet up the intent was there though. I would‚Äôve never known if I didn‚Äôt snoop so she‚Äôs also keeping secrets from me. 

It sucks, I really liked her and I feel like I wasted my time. She‚Äôs crying and asking to forgive her, and I‚Äôd be lying if I said I didn‚Äôt want to. I still have feelings for her obviously. 

But I can‚Äôt get over it. 

What would y‚Äôall do?

UPDATE:

I told her I couldn‚Äôt trust her anymore and we broke up. 

I‚Äôm surprised by the comments however:
The majority of you said to end it, and a large portion of you said it was wrong of me to snoop as well which I understand.
But I‚Äôm really shocked by the few who said her cheating was my fault? 
I absolutely disagree.","If I was you it personally wouldn't matter to me whether they actually met up or not, under the context provided the intent was clear. This is a dude she met at a bar, and exchanged numbers with, I can't think of a reason that that would occur other than hooking up, especially with a ü•∞ emoji. Violation of trust achieved.

dating,x6fyxm,2022-09-05 13:16:02,Anyone else find it extremely dumb that having no dating experience by a certain age is a red flag?,"I feel like people often assume the worst if they found out it was the person they‚Äôre seeing‚Äôs first relationship or potential relationship.

I‚Äôll give myself as an example. I‚Äôm a 22M, I didn‚Äôt really want to get into dating after I was done with college bc I didn‚Äôt want me or my SO to turn down a dream job to stay close to the other person. I had a ‚Äúgirlfriend‚Äù in middle school and went to a few school dances and hooked up with one of those dates when I was 17. Aside from that? Nothing.

People just hear ‚Äúafter college‚Äù and ‚Äúno relationship‚Äù and just assume I‚Äôm some horrible person bc in their heads no one found me desirable. In reality I just wasn‚Äôt really looking, so if girls were showing me signs of interest I didn‚Äôt notice.

Not to mention we had a fucking pandemic from 2020 to basically now lol.

Edit: just noting I‚Äôm not some neckbeard who lives in their parents basement. I have a few pics of me on my account if u wanna see lol

Edit 2. A lot of you don‚Äôt know how to read lol.","I wish I would‚Äôve known this was a red flag before I told a guy I really liked that I hadn‚Äôt kissed anyone in 8 years because now this makes me think that this is probably the reason he lost interest lmao

To be fair, I always felt like if you knew you wanted to get married, you should date with intention. And none of the guys I got approached by were approaching me because they wanted a future with me. Literally all of them just wanted to sleep with me."
dating,fczhk2,2020-03-03 19:00:20,"European style of dating: They don't ""date"". They hang out and see what happens.","I'm probably being too broad when I say ""european"". When I first heard there was not a strong tradition ""dating"" over there (specifically France) I wondered what that meant. I was told by a friend that it simply meant you hung out with people with no preconditions or assumptions. Then if the mood and timing was right, you acted on it.

I have dated over the past year. For the most part I've avoided putting any real effort into dating for about 4 months now. This ""euro style"" came to mind because I think I have accidently found myself doing that. Let me draw some comparisons.

&#x200B;

**Example 1**

I did go on a ""date"" with someone about a month ago. We met through a dating site. 

* This means we were both trying to process each other.
* Understand if we could be partners.
* We probably had our mind on the potential of romance, overlooking the potential for friendship.
* We probably both wondered IF sex was a possibility.

Under that setup there's a lot of pressure and it didn't work out. It was a date and so I only analyzed it from that perspective and I imagine she did to some extent as well.

&#x200B;

**Example 2**

**Here's an example of another recent situation.** I asked out a coworker with very honest intentions: I wanted to socialize and make friends.

* I thought she was cute but I was not necessarily super attracted to her but I didn't care because I wasn't trying to ""date"" her.
* I didn't entirely care whether she liked me too much. I just wanted a friend at work and meet a new person.
* Eventually when her and I hung out at a bar, I did not necessarily consider it a date. She didn't either. I didn't really have strong interest in her at the time. 
* However as the months passed... we've both realized we really enjoy each other's company more than we expected. There's a lot of flirtation and tension there. It's fun.

What made Example 2 so interesting is that I was never focused on asking myself if she sees me as a romantic partner. It allowed us to just take our time and get to know each other.

\------

**Does anyone else prefer this non-dating approach? It seems more sensible to me. It seems more patient.**",To be honest i hate the european style :/ i dont wanna waste months to get to the point. Im german and im god damn straight forward!

Some people act like they're nice and polite and ""a good listener"" like it's some kind of huge plus, when in reality it's something you should always be doing without thinking about it. 

Like look at it this way - I don't act like wearing a shirt when I leave my house makes me some kind of good person, I just do it.  Decency should be the same way - things like making sure the other person is comfortable with the place you're going, not pushing things on people they don't want to do, manners, not leading people on, letting people know you aren't interested instead of ghosting them - you should do these things because they are the right thing to do, not because you expect something in return from them.

And let me be clear, you can be decent and still keep your boundaries.  Like for example, if a guy doesn't want to go to an expensive restaurant, he can decline that if a girl suggests it and it doesn't make him an asshole, but it does if he does it anyway and expects something in return for it. Does this make sense? I promise you if you do these things, the right people will notice and it will take you far.",The problem is that we've all had our emotions shit on such that decency seems like pure bliss lol

There's no such thing as lowering your standards! Attraction is not a choice, you can't just simply go: ""OK, I'll just feel attracted to this less attractive person then..."". Standards isn't even a thing, there are just people you find attractive and there are people that you don't.

What you can do is meet more people, improve at interacting with them and figure out that what you're looking for is actually what you find attractive in the opposite sex. 

What you're basically saying to people by telling them to lower their standards is telling them they're not good enough to find real love and they should just settle for someone they're not really attracted to.",I think the advice should be ‚Äúwork on yourself‚Äù rather than ‚Äúlower your standards.‚Äù

He doesn't see me anything more than a friend , but we agreed to be monogamous.  So we have become pretty tight and supportive of each other.
Because I need more out of a relationship, I have been openly looking and FWB is aware.  I have started dating someone I really like and think this relationship can blossom into something more.  I have regular CAH/mushroom nights that both men will be part of.   Since fwb will continue as a close friend, the two will eventually end up meeting.

If he found out then that you've been sleeping with him a long time and that you just casually hung out with him as part of the friends group... My guess is that would blow up in your face.

She was upset, so I apologized for how I phrased my question because I didn‚Äôt want this to blow up over something silly.

dating,ckdu92,2019-07-31 20:19:30,A Dating Handbook for Guys: How I've Had Many Successful Dates,"**Disclaimer**: This isn't a rulebook. This worked for me and there is no one right way to date. Do whatever works for you. I don't mean for this to sound braggy either, I've been ghosted and had bad dates as well! I just found some things that helped and wanted to share.

Also, I'm measuring ""success"" as finding someone who reciprocates your feelings and shows mutual interest. Not necessarily ""we had sex on the first date.""

Let's begin.

**The app:**

* It's 2019, we're all on the apps, Hinge and Bumble I've had the best luck on, in that order. Make sure your photos are decent quality and show your face up close and whole body. 
NO shirtless mirror pics, no selfies if possible. Make sure your main (1st photo) is clearly only you so girls don't have to guess which one you are in a group photo.

* It's important to approach dating, as a guy, from the perspective that you are qualifying them. Too many guys are trying to impress, compliment, and put women on a pedestal. Once you match with a girl, see if she's even what you are into. Any connection there? Great, after 10 min or an hour (whenever you get a feeling she's what you're into) I would usually drop, ""I'm not on here much, [my phone number] text me if you want."" 9/10 times I'd get a text within 10 minutes. 

**Texting**:

* At this point you're seeing if you want to get a 1st date together. Usually I'd ask for an IG profile if they didn't have good pics to make sure they really look how they appeared in the dating app. 

* I like asking, ""What are a few things you like about yourself that don't have to do with your appearance?"" This requires a bit of depth and weeds out the superficial girls. Also, you get to know them on a slightly deeper level early on.

* I've run text conversations for an hour or a few days if I'm unsure about a date. At some point I'd say, ""Do you want to get drinks some time?"" Again, 99% of the time they say yes. Think about it, they matched with you, kept talking in the dating app, took your number down, texted you first, kept texting you for however long, so there's a high chance they agree to a date!

**The first date:** 

* Text her the morning of, ""I'm excited to meet you later, I'll see you at [time agreed upon]!"" This allows her to confirm she's going. If she doesn't respond she's not interested and is a shitty human being for ghosting you the day of. Let it go and move on.

* It's always drinks. I know it sounds boring but if the date is a disaster, doesn't look like her photos, is weird, you finish your drink and leave. You're not stuck eating, waiting for a check, waiting for a movie or game to end. 

* Know a little about the bar you're going to beforehand and pick a quiet area so you can actually hear eachother. 

* Get there 5 minutes early and order.

* Stand up when she arrives and give her a FULL HUG, no side hug, no fucking hand shake, no kissing, just give a solid hug (like 2 seconds) and say how nice it is to see them.

* Ask them questions! Remember you're seeing if this is someone you want to continue dating. Moments of silence are OK, maintain healthy normal eye contact but be direct. 

* After about 1.5 hours I typically say that I'm ready to call it a night if they are. It's good to end the 1st date on a high note. Ironically if you guys are having a good time and you call the date to a close this does seem to make them consider that you were not having a great time. Personally I just don't like sitting and talking for a long ass time. 

* ALWAYS PAY FOR THE DRINKS. They should offer but just fucking pay. Chances are you picked the bar, you knew the drink prices, and you shouldn't be taking people out if you can't afford a few drinks. If they offer to leave the tip I always let them. Paying can actually help out later, I'll bring it up again.

* Walk them to their car give them a hug and say, ""I had a really great time."" 

About 70% of the time the girl would text me when she got home thanking me for the drinks or commenting on the date being nice. 

Forgot to mention, get the door for them especially if you're driving. 

**MORE DISCLAIMERS: I wrote the above in a way that makes it sound like I'm literally saying exactly what to do, I'm not, I'm just saying that's what I've done. Every date is different and complex, I've made out at the end of a 1st date because I texted/talked to a girl for a week before, and then I've had dates where I texted the girl for 2 days before going out together so there wasn't as much chemistry yet. Do what works for you!**","I think your advice is spot-on. As a woman who met my boyfriend on Tinder two years ago, he did all of this pretty much to the letter, except we had dinner instead of drinks on the first date. Women get so many creepy, strange, or half-assed messages that a guy who follows your advice is so refreshing. It's a confident approach. I would add just make sure when you message to throw something in that indicates you read her profile. It's very common to receive generic messages, so something unique, even if it's brief, is very much appreciated."
dating,vj9van,2022-06-23 23:12:53,Ghosted after sex‚Ä¶.,"I (32F) Met a guy on bumble (42M). His profile said ‚Äúrelationship‚Äù. We had been texting for couple of weeks then finally met for a first date.

He was even hotter in person and I would say he is a 10, handsome tall successful. Im just a normal girl. Im immediately smitten. The next day he asked me to come over and we had sex. I‚Äôve never had sex with anyone Im not in a relationship with and this is the fastest I gave it up. I told him this. But I really liked him so I didnt care. We continue texting and sexting. Im really into him now. The next week he asked me out again for dinner. Then we had sex the 2nd time. After, He said sorry, couldnt stay the night. Ok. I gave him a passionate long kiss. 

After this 2nd sexual encounter I never heard from him again. Literally his last text was the night we had sex. He used to initiate texting me everyday but now it‚Äôs been one week of radio silence. I am very hurt since I really like him. I was always in relationships and dont have much casual/sexual experience so  I really am taking this hard.

EDIT: thank you everyone for your responses. Writing here is helping me process my emotions. 

And to all saying I should text him first- I did text him first a couple days after to greet him for father‚Äôs day and he responded. But nobody has reached out after that day and Im not sure I should initiate again. Maybe he didnt ghost but he still lost interest.",Maybe he died.
dating,snmbu9,2022-02-08 15:03:30,Why do most women seem upset about how they get so many matches and likes on dating apps and sites?,"This is coming from the perspective of a guy that has a less than 1 per 100 swipe match rate for tinder, having never gotten a bumble match, and my last hinge match was in July.

How is there ever such a thing as too many matches? Like ideally if you are trying to find a partner, you would want to get more matches and more dates so you can find that person right? So why is it bad to get hundreds of matches a month?

My friend gets a match every other swipe and complains about it. She said she just doesn‚Äôt like it as it‚Äôs ‚Äútoo much‚Äù. This was right before she watched me swipe right on through 142 profiles without resulting in a single match. My tinder analysis data was abysmal also. She laughed at me because of how low my match rate is.

So obviously she feels my position isn‚Äôt great but said she‚Äôd rather have my match rate than hers. I see her sentiment echoed on this sub a lot and I‚Äôve never understood it. So why?

Why is getting tons of matches and attention bad and potentially tons of dates bad? 

Edit, just want to add I‚Äôm not a misogynist trying to instigate an argument, I just don‚Äôt get it as I‚Äôm in the opposite boat",It mostly reminds me of being conventionally attractive (not complaining) but that 99% of those matches just want a cum bucket
dating,u44s58,2022-04-15 10:09:58,Is dating as a man really this bad?,"My partner and I have been going out for some time now, and I was thinking about some of the things that he told me about his previous experiences on dates, and it really struck me as unfortunate.

He's young (like, 20s), good looking, smart, well-traveled, with a European accent. Everyone adores him. He just left our job and customers have been coming up, asking about him, whom don't talk to him outside of work. All of his friends are protective of him, and care about him, and are very well-rounded, honest individuals. I do not believe that he is the problem.

Most of my friends who are women (and his too) would get maybe 100 likes on their dating profiles a month, whereas him and his friends who are blokes would be lucky to get one or two a month, let ALONE a conversation or possible date.

Then, once he was FINALLY able to invite someone out - while not EVERY woman he met acted this way obviously - his date would always be extremely critical and/or needy, while still putting forward the impression that ""this doesn't mean anything - we are not dating, etc."" Before me, he'd never cuddled, or been physically loved in any real romantic capacity outside of sexual, and hadn't been able to date in about 4 years, because finding someone who wasn't just willing, but WANTED to date him, had basically been impossible. And, to add icing to the cake, basically all of his mates have agreed that this is just the reality of dating for them all.

I've never really dated in this way, I admit, so I don't understand how scary it is to go out with a stranger, especially as a woman. Being on the autism spectrum, maybe there's something socially I'm missing, but, I mean, seriously?

It's not that he's overbearing when interested in someone either. He was interested in me (obviously), and we even went out a couple of times before we were dating, and he was always cheerful, chivalrous, and respectful. All of his friends are polished, hygienic, pleasant men, and obviously I think he is more-so, and yet, all struggled to date? Is this just what it's like for you guys, or is my boyfriend just particularly unlucky?

EDIT: Wow, I didn't realise so many people felt this way - I'm so sorry.

I give my partner my time, money, and love as often as he needs it. I was taught to treat partners how you wish to be treated, i.e, you can't expect to be pampered and spoiled if you don't first set an example. I'm often worried that I'm not doing enough to make him happy (not by his doing - I'm still growing), and while this makes me feel incredibly reassured, it also saddens me. I hope you all find or have found people whom love you properly, and make you feel safe.","# yes, yes it is this bad"
dating,sosxqe,2022-02-10 00:49:56,"If you were dating a man who was lacking in the size department, would you prefer he told you before you got intimate?","I haven't started dating yet, but one issue that particular worries me is my lack of size.  I am about 4 inches hard.  I know this is a size that may start to cause issues, and I don't want to go through the experience of a woman laughing when she pulls my pants down, or being super interested before sex and then being horribly disappointed.  Therefore, I am thinking that it may be best to let woman know beforehand of my situation.  I understand this may come across as super insecure and turn some women off, but I'd rather that then be humiliated.

So say you were seeing a guy, would it bother you if he told you this before intimacy?

Edit-  Really appreciate the kind words and some of the honesty from everyone here.  I will definitely focus on making sure I do lots of foreplay and satisfy her before jumping right into penetration.  I think I won't tell her beforehand, but that's still a decision to be made.  Thanks guys :).",Become a cunning linguist.

Just wanted to give a shout out to all our friends who support us as we try our hand at dating.

I had arranged for a second date with a girl tonight, all sorted out, both looking forward to it then she starts ghosting me.

Talking to a friend this afternoon saying that ""Man I think I'm getting stood up tonight.""

His immediate response, was ""No your not, I will meet you at 8pm, and we will have the best bro date""

Just wanted to give him a shout out, the guy didn't skip a beat to support me and turn what would have been a pretty horrible night into a great one.

Edit:

So an update for you guys. We met at the indoor mini golf place we have drinks, we play, we actually meet some really nice couples playing golf in front of us and behind us.

We go to a pub after to keep the good vibes going. He let me talk out my disappointment, we discuss strategy so it doesn't happen again. Also had fantastic laughs thinking about ""what if she actually turned up!""

But great night the search continues","Aw that is amazing! What a great friend.

dating,whpcxf,2022-08-06 14:16:22,Men Won‚Äôt Date Me,"I‚Äôm a chubby girl and haven‚Äôt dated since high school. Since I‚Äôve been in college (four years) I‚Äôve noticed guys only ever want to have sex with me and NEVER want to date me or have anything serious. 

I‚Äôve had everything from talking to a guy on and off for over two years, casual sex, talking on the phone everyday for weeks, texting all day everyday. They talk big game about dating/potential relationship/dates .. then it always happens .. they just ghost me or stop responding. 

I‚Äôm not sure what I‚Äôm doing wrong.. I‚Äôve told some I‚Äôm just seeing where things go and others I‚Äôve told I‚Äôm looking for something serious. I‚Äôm starting to think men just want to have sex with me but refuse to actually date or go out with me. 

Why do guys do this? Is it me? Am I doing something wrong?


Edit: Hi all! I just wanted to come on and thank everyone who commented with advice (whether you were nice or rude about it). I read every comment and it helped me realize A LOT.

My weight clearly seems to be a bigger issue than I originally thought. All the comments made me realize men‚Äôs image is more important to them than I realized. They also helped me realize that my weight could be stopping men from taking me serious enough for anything other than sex. That aside, I‚Äôm happy to say I‚Äôm currently working to lose weight (36lbs down)! However, I‚Äôm losing it for ME and not a man. Whether I‚Äôm skinny or fat, I want a man to love me for me not just bc I‚Äôm a certain size.

I also realized a lot of men aren‚Äôt really looking for relationships at the moment. Clearly the men I‚Äôm attracting/attracted to only want sex or a skinnier girl. However, I‚Äôm no longer going to be a ‚Äúyes girl‚Äù as I learned I am in the comments. The dating scene is crazy rn whether you‚Äôre skinny or fat. So, I‚Äôm thinking that I might take a break from it all and focus on myself and improving my mental and physical health. 

Thanks again everyone!","I was overweight. I had similar dating issues. I put a ton of hard work in at the gym and lost weight, got healthy and fit, and my dating life changed.  Was it easy? NO.  Was it worth it? YES.

There's this lie pervading our culture that we should just accept ourselves as is and expect others to do the same. But life isn't fair and that will never happen (it didn't for me). I wasn't born with the greatest genes. Both my parents are/were  severely overweight.  I was never taught about health nor exercise.  But I made those difficult changes and my life did change.

However, this did not and does not change my self-worth.  Self-worth comes from within and I knew I was worth taking care of. I watched my parents struggle with diabetes, lost one parent to cancer.  Being healthy doesn't mean you're doing it only for external appearance rather I didn't want to end up like my parents.

As for your dating? These guys are the worst!!!

They will use you for sex and only sex and then ghost.  I felt used and abused when I thought the act would only bring us closer and potentially lead to a long term relationship.  It never did.  The only people who were interested in me, I wasn't interested in. So I asked the tough question: what type of person do I want to attract?

The answer: You will attract what you are.

&#x200B;

OP: Don't go and start to exercise just for a man.  Don't better yourself with the intent on attracting a man. They will, more times than none, disappoint you, because they too are just people, and people are all flawed.  Build inner strength and self-motivation that will last through any storm you may face.  If you build yourself up for yourself, you will undoubtedly be able to attract many amazing things in life. I genuinely wish you the best, and do know you're not alone when it comes to issues like this.  Dating is so hard.  Especially today with social media and all these dating apps... Don't let these bad apples sour the entire batch. There is still many good people out there.  You got this."

While commenting and discussing dating with strangers seemed harmless at first, it has become increasingly draining over the past few months. Reading the general dating advice and venting on this sub has become detrimental and I urge everyone who sees a similar pattern to just leave also.

Don't they realize that of course a girl may catch feelings? Don't they realize that this is basically manipulation? I'm also quite saddened that, according to my observations, a lot of girls enable this.

I find it more disrespectful to waste someone's time as opposed to just being straight-up. If I'm nothing more than sex to someone, I don't want to be treated like I am something more. My standards are literally just honesty and straight-forwardness.","The short answer: because they want to have sex and that's the only way they can get it.

The longer (more accurate) answer: you *may* be attacking a straw man here. Just because they leave after having sex with you, that doesn't mean that was their intention all along. The sex itself or some other factor could have led them to decide that they don't want to continue to see you. That doesn't mean they necessarily set out to just ""hit it and quit it."""

dating,wtq95v,2022-08-21 04:13:29,I‚Äôve been pretending to be married at work for the past year and I‚Äôve built an entire fake husband,"Okay, hear me out. I‚Äôm a mid 20s single minority female working in tech for a large fortune 100 company. Although I‚Äôm a high performer with cred and skills to back it up - I was working with middle aged caucasian men that could care less about my words, opinions, or value‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..until I wore a wedding band. 

It was like an instant switch. I read articles and research papers on how women with familys are treated better than single women in the workplace. I bought this big ass ring and started wearing it during face to faces in the office, conferences, and zoom meetings. I became seen, respected, and my words were no longer taken with a grain of salt. Now don‚Äôt get me wrong - I don‚Äôt put on a ring and am all of a sudden a highly respected individual at work. I put on the ring and I‚Äôm no longer a ‚Äúdamsel in distress without guidance of a man in my life.‚Äù There‚Äôs no longer the expectation of me to be a high performing individual, just an expectation for me to fulfill the goal and go home to family. I was getting congratulated for doing my everyday job well. Men stopped interrupting me when I was talking, started asking me my opinion if I was ever too quiet in a meeting, and were more open in sharing their personal lives. So naturally, I started to share some as well. Nothing huge, just like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm heading here with my family‚Äù or ‚Äúwe‚Äôre celebrating whatever holiday at this place.‚Äù

Then the fake husband emerged. He doesn‚Äôt even have a name, or an age, or a race? Just a profession. I work remotely and have been for 2 years. My director asks me to move ACROSS the country in 2 months to be hybrid. I‚Äôm on camera, I‚Äôm caught off guard, and I decide to respond with ‚ÄúI cannot relocate, my husband is in his last year of residency at the hospital.‚Äù I literally in that moment turned my $50 wedding ring from Amazon into a husband working as an ER doctor in his 3rd year of residency. So in 7 months, my fake husbands fake residency will end, and i will be in San Jose with make fake ring leaving the office at 5 to make my fake husband dinner. 

In a perfect world I‚Äôll have a real husband by the time I show up to the office. In a realistic world I‚Äôll be getting a fake divorce. As of right now, I decided to change my bumble profile to ‚Äúlooking for marriage.‚Äù

dating,ozkkqi,2021-08-07 02:07:20,Friend turned me down but continues to openly flirt and cuddle with me. It makes me confused and frustrated.,"I asked her on a date and she said no because ""she doesnt want to risk losing me as a friend"". Seeing as a lot of people say different things to let someone down easier, Im not sure if that's really the reason. But we still flirt, I sleep over in her bed and cuddle with her for hours. She shows me private pictures, etc. I just dont understand. As shes been my friend for years now, I dont want to assume that shes just stringing me along for her own benefit, but thats really what it feels like. 

One part of me doesnt mind as long as we are both enjoying what we're doing, but the other part of me is confused and exhausted, as it blurs the lines between friendship and more. I dont want it to stop but if shes just not interested I wish she would be straight up with me so we can set proper boundaries and I can start moving on.

EDIT: Damn this really blew up more than I thought it would.

To clarify with more context, since I saw this in a few posts. She had a boyfriend previously in our friendship, and I cuddled with her during the tail end of that. Boyfriend did not care until the relationship was over, they broke up, got back together, and she dropped me entirely as a friend to get back with him (as one of his ""conditions""). We did kiss a couple of times during their break but it was under the influence of stuff and I did not take it seriously anyways. They broke up again, she apologized and resumed contact and we moved on. I have no ill feelings towards her for that. That was about a year ago. Although thinking back on it, it does point in the direction that the cuddling was never entirely platonic. And Ive seen her interact with her friends/best friend and never seen them cuddle in the manners we do. 

Either way, everyone made a lot of good points. I think my plan is to just take a step back and just stop cuddling/flirting. If she asks, Ill be honest why - ""I still have feelings and its unfair to both of us to continue like this."" Ive tried dating other people and I am just simply too uninterested to get anywhere with them, thats how ive always been. And i dont want to lead people on if Im genuinely not into them just to get her attention, thats fucked up.","You gotta be honest with yourself and with her

""I wanna be more than friends, I understand that you don't see me that way and I completely respect your decision. I however, have to do what's best for me; and therefore I'm putting distance between us. Take care and I'll always hope for the best for you and that you find your happiness""  

And then just let it be and take care of yourself and you'll be able to move on when the time is right...it's not easy but things happen for a reason, and continuing to hangout, sleep over, cuddle etc is only going to cause you grief and life's too short for that

Good luck homie

Edit: the new information on the situation really shines a new light on this girl, and it's not good...she sounds like a user, emotionally immature, and indecisive

OP, the reason I say to just go ahead and tell her is because that puts the ball in your court and will do you more good than you currently realize...it's the whole can't see the forest for the trees thing...you setting around waiting on her to start asking ""why aren't you coming over to cuddle?"" Is just going to cause you more stress in the long run

Love is a good thing, and a huge part of love is putting someone else before yourself, like a parent who goes without in order to make sure their kids are provided for...but love is also a 2 way street, and one sided relationships don't work...this girl invites you over, shows you naked pictures of herself, cuddles with you, kisses you, sleeps beside you; and then tells you she's not into you like that

Allowing that to continue is a ""nice guy"" move, and it's unhealthy for you and for her...she's using you, but you won't be able to fully understand that until you've stood up for yourself and put some distance and time between you two

You deserve better than that all day long"

dating,10yssaz,2023-02-10 14:03:04,"I met a girl on a plane when I was heading out for a 2 week solo vacation. Now four years later, she's my girlfriend and I've moved here for good.","Just wanted to share this story. Four years ago I was having a difficult time with work and living alone. Had not been in a serious relationship for months, friends had grown distant because of my work priorities and overall I'd just been spending my days away working and sleeping (literal version of feeling ""dead inside""). My ""vacations"" used to be to just go visit my parents for a week every summer and during holiday season.


On a whim I decided to spend 2 weeks of my saved up holidays. Manager knew what I was going through so he approved without asking too many questions. I then took a holiday to Glasgow, as I always wanted to take a long vacation to Scotland/Ireland solo myself, after I'd visited it during a U.K. trip with my parents years ago. Met a girl on the plane who was going to visit home on her university vacation, she was also heading to Glasgow and we talked for a long time until we boarded the flight.


On the first (longer) flight itself, she and I had different seats unfortunately, and we wanted to continue our interaction over the flight so we checked around our seats. On my side there was a couple sitting so that was a no go but near her seat was a solo passenger who was a bit resistant to switch. I managed to convince him by slipping a 100 to him while the flight attendant wasn't watching (my seat was actually a better seat too). And then we just spent the entire flight talking to each other or doing random stuff together (including watching a couple of movies she had on her). Though we sat separately for the shorter flight, I got her number.


I had a lot of solo fun in Scotland, but I met up with her 4 times in those 2 weeks. I returned to Canada, and when university season started she returned too. We had been talking all this time and started dating for the remainder of her program. Later, she decided Canada wasn't for her so she moved back to Scotland... dead set on not wanting to lose her, I ended up planning my own move to the U.K. and looking into opportunities. Fortunately, my employer had a few open posts in England and agreed to ship me over, even though it was costly as this was pre-Brexit (this was the only time my overemphasis on performance reviews at work and overtime paid off). I got a 5 year work visa and landed myself in Liverpool. It was a total of 7 months of long distance, while I was figuring out my move.


Since then, it's been jumping between Glasgow and Liverpool till covid happened. Once work became wfh, I moved in with her to Glasgow, and haven't moved out since. Still working wfh, and I couldn't have imagined I'd be this happy 4 years ago. Gonna start work on ILR soon as I'd have lived 5 years here in UK pretty soon.


Tl;dr: A 100 CAD and some workaholicness got me the love of my life. Also ages in this story are 28M and 27F currently (24M and 23F 4 years ago).

dating,oku4xm,2021-07-15 14:37:42,"Proposing in public is the worst idea, right?","It hasn‚Äôt happened to me, but it sounds terrible.

Basically, the proposer is putting the proposee on the spot and forcing them to choose between saying yes, or publicly humiliating their partner. That isn‚Äôt a free choice.

If I proposed, I‚Äôd want my partner to be able to really consider it, be free to say such things as ¬´¬†not yet¬†¬ª or ¬´¬†not sure¬†¬ª, because that is what makes the value of the ¬´¬†yes¬†¬ª.

dating,syjr6w,2022-02-22 09:52:27,Guy I'm seeing is a cheapskate. Do I proceed?,"I (24F) have been seeing this guy (28M) for about 4 months. Most of our dates are home made dinners (mostly my preference). However, when we do go out, we always split, or I end up picking the bill because I feel like splitting is tacky. He usually offers to send his half and unless it's a considerate amount I decline. I think he has picked up one bill since we've started dating, and I somehow feel he was expecting me to transfer my half. 

He picks up the ingredients for whatever he's cooking, but if I ever want anything extra (even the smallest thing), I have to get it myself. He doesn't necessarily say it, but I can tell by the way he acts - he tries to convince me whatever I want to get is unnecessary or too expensive. 

He looks for deals on everything, which I normally wouldn't mind, I do the same thing, but not to this extent. I know he makes more money than me, so it is not a money issue. The gifts he got me so far were ridiculous, while I tried to personalize whatever I got for him and listened to what he actually wanted.

I didn't want this to bother me, but it is bothering me and I am losing attraction. I don't think he should pay for everything, I have no problems picking up the check every now and then, but this whole rigorous 50/50 thing is grossing me out. Whatever I suggest, he suggests the cheaper, wacker thing. And it's not like I suggest luxurious things.

I grew up poor, and for as long as I can remember I wanted to live a life where I don't have to double check prices and remove chewing gum from my shopping cart because I feel it is too expensive. Now that I have created that security for myself, I don't want to be with someone who will make me go through it all over again unnecessarily. He grew up rich, so I truly cannot comprehend where this is coming from.

I don't know how to bring up this topic, and I also feel that this isn't a character trait that will change anyway. Should I just end it now? Is this an incompatibility issue that cannot be worked on?",Financial compatibility (meaning how you deal with money) is important. This won‚Äôt change.

I deleted all my dating apps and bought single tickets to a local TEDx talk and a concert that I'm really interested in.

For all the times we try to take someone on a fun date or adventure and they end up either not being into it or things just fizzle out, when is the last time you took yourself out? I know that other people who go to these things have the same interests. Without a date you're pretty much free to talk to whoever you want and just share the experience. 

&#x200B;

I'm just excited to be making myself a priority instead of constantly trying to think about some girl I matched with or wishing things had gone better with a date. It's easy to ignore the good things in life so for anyone else struggling, try looking up some local events and just go. Go with no expectations and just focus on enjoying yourself.

We were long distance, about 4 hours apart. Things were great at the start. We‚Äôd see each other every second week. Then he got lazy, and I didn‚Äôt see him for 7 weeks. There were loads of other flags along the way that I decided to ignore: some included never meeting his friends, his brother (who he stayed with when he would visit), never went on any real dates beyond the initial month or so of us dating, he would never ask me to come see him so I was always waiting for him to decide when it suits him. Nail in the coffin for me though? Found him back on Tinder, complete with updated photos after we both deleted it together months ago. 

He‚Äôs 30 and I‚Äôm 28. It took me longer than I would have liked to end it but when I confronted him about Tinder he denied it. Said it wasn‚Äôt his profile - yeah ok *insert eye roll* and that he deleted it months ago. I had a gut instinct something more was going on so I checked out his Instagram followers.. what do I find? Girls, girls oh and you I guessed it, more girls. Flirty comments under his photos from literally 5-8 weeks ago, flirty comments on these girls profiles from him from literally 5-8 weeks ago. 

We spoke and it was very clear that he never saw anything more than fun with me. So I did it. I ended it. And you know I‚Äôm not even sad. Sure I‚Äôll miss talking to him but I‚Äôve seen him once in the last 10 weeks so I‚Äôll survive.

Vanilla girl
A girl who exudes elegance. A girl that doesn't go all out to impress; her simplicity is her selling point.
A girl not afraid to embrace her femininity and looks good in anything because she feels good.
Just like vanilla icecream, after all your exploration you'll always come back.

2. Guys complaining about looks, height and genes while putting 0 effort in the things they CAN change.


3. Guys complaining about ""ALL WOMEN want money or looks"", basically judging women that they are swallow.


4. Guys literally hating women because of past experiences(trauma).


I get it, life is unfair. I've been cheated on, rejected multiple times and judged for being short.


Instead of complaining and being a victim, get your shit together brother.


That's what strong men do. 


They go through adversity, they manage their feelings and they get what they want out of life.


Your today's thoughts are your future. Fix them, upgrade your self as much as possible and accept failure as part of life.


And most importantly believe that you're a valuable human being by default. Just cause you're born.


Hope that helps someone out there.","The problem with this post, for those in the comments saying ‚Äúwhy is this being downvoted‚Äù, is that it is essentially telling men to ‚Äúman up‚Äù, in the same society that on the other hand is trying to tell men to move away from toxic masculinity and stop feeling like they can‚Äôt show emotions or speak up, this picture of ‚Äúman up‚Äù is a big factor is worryingly high suicide rates. 

I‚Äôm a short guy, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5. I more or less agree with everything you‚Äôve said. I‚Äôve had multiple good looking girlfriends, and maybe some think it isn‚Äôt something to feel good about but I‚Äôve slept with quite a few more women than taller and sometimes better looking guys have, knowing how to talk to women and carry yourself with self respect, confidence and self reassurance is massively important to the amount of status people will label you with, and regardless of what incels and extreme feminists will tell you online, status is important for female attraction, stats like height, shoulder width etc are just things associated with status. I‚Äôm not arguing with your logic at all, and neither does the science.

The problem is that there are genuine problems being caused to us all (not just struggling men) by things like social media and dating apps. Dating apps aren‚Äôt designed to help create happy relationships, their business model relies on people being single and confused, always looking for something ‚Äúbetter‚Äù, creating over choice for some (which humans really struggle with, more choices don‚Äôt equal more happiness) and a life of empty promises for others. Social media uses algorithms to push the most genetically gifted and beautiful people to the top of what we see, it damages people‚Äôs self worth and creates unrealistic and unachievable ‚Äúgoals‚Äù for normal people, it creates an illusion of being able to obtain things (be it looks or a partner) that for many we just won‚Äôt be able to, it‚Äôs a dangling carrot and it‚Äôs fucking us up. The answer to that surely can‚Äôt be ‚Äúdon‚Äôt discuss, just pretend it‚Äôs fine‚Äù.

The woman I‚Äôm currently dating was a dead set ‚ÄúI only date guys over 6 foot‚Äù height queen. She had been married and was going through a divorce, we met in a bar and her friends are fucking shocked that she is seeing me, because she was dead ass never dating somebody shorter than 6 foot, never mind somebody who is ever so slightly shorter than her. We where discussing it last week and it turned out she actually thought that 6 foot was average height, when I told her to google it she was shocked. She has also been surprised at several stereotypes she held not being true, I can reach the top shelf, my height doesn‚Äôt make me weak- rough (but caring) sex isn‚Äôt off the table, I‚Äôm not mortified or upset when she wears heels, I dont have a short temper and get jealous of taller men etc, these are all things that get commonly spread about shorter men that aren‚Äôt true but again guys are told to shut up and get on with it. You compare that to women who are considered strong and brave for being extremely vocal when they have suffered at the hands of stereotypes and social conditioning and the difference that has made over time for women‚Äôs rights It‚Äôs cool to say all men under X height are unattractive and women are cool to label them as less masculine and thus not suitable as a partner but if a guy says ‚Äúif she‚Äôs slept with more than 10 guys she isn‚Äôt girlfriend material‚Äù then what you have is the guy being labelled a misogynist, despite those stereotypes coming from the exact same place- everybody knows the term misogyny but go around asking people what does ‚Äúmisandry‚Äù mean and most don‚Äôt have a clue, the two phrases mean the same but only one is commonly used and spoken about, think about that. I feel like it‚Äôs misguided to tell men they shouldn‚Äôt discuss their issues, especially on a public forum, it would be much better if people could come on here and receive support rather than hatred so they could then go back out into the real world with some sort of positivity for change instead of getting stuck on the wheel of ‚Äúkeep it all bottled up, never show pain‚Äù, that isn‚Äôt healthy."

dating,xjumli,2022-09-21 04:20:24,Paying for dates,"This has been discussed alot, but most people are not grasping the concept of why the man should be paying for a date. I'm a man btw.

It shows leadership and dominance in a positive way, which is what the girl wants. It's not about the money or that she's using you for money, forget about the momey for a second.  She wants the guy to be the leader and take care of everything so she can feel comfortable.

 Also, since the man almost always initiates the dates. It makes sense that he pays since he invited her out. 
Hassling your date for payment just makes it awkward and ruins the flow and is not romantic at all, at that point it just feels like 2 friends hanging out, which is not what you want.

It doesn't have to be an extravagant expensive dinner or event either. A simple Starbucks meeting should do. Then afterwards inexpensive dinner if it goes well. If she is only using you for free food, trust me you'll know early on.
If the man complains that he can't afford a simple coffee date, then do something to make more money. Dont complain. The burden is not on the woman, it's on the man since he's supposed to be in charge, I say this in a positive way. Women don't want to be in charge. They just want a fun laid back experience with you. 

Trust me I speak from experience, i always pay for our date, even when she offers I tell her don't worry about it. If the date doesn't work out then no big deal, it was a risk I was willing to take. Dating is a risk.","I‚Äôm a woman.  If I ask someone out on a date I offer to split the check or to pay.  If I‚Äôm asking you out I am not assuming you pay.  

If I don‚Äôt know you and you ask me out I‚Äôm ok with splitting the check, or let you pay if the date went *well* 

If someone tells me they‚Äôre going to pay and makes it some kind of weird power move and doesn‚Äôt accept my money; we aren‚Äôt going on many more dates after that because it will rub me the wrong way."
dating,tklow3,2022-03-23 04:12:40,"If you are not getting dates, don't blame women for having height preferences, materilaistic or that they are not great conversationalists. Wanna know the real reason? You are boring.","I know it's just a meme and some people are just having fun with it, but I am soo tired of seeing men making posts on Reddit because they can't get dates or make memes about women because they have height preferences or that they give one word responses. 

Here's the reality. You are NOT not getting dates because you're short, ugly or poor. You're not getting dates because you're boring and don't understand how to excite women. 

First of all, there's literally nothing wrong with women having height preferences. The audacity these men have complaining about women having some kind of physical attribute as preference is laughable. We are men. If anything we are WAY more picky in terms of looks. 

Secondly, being short don't mean shit. Tinder Swindler is fucking 5'9. Ok that's far from being short, but ain't 6 feet either. Yes, women would love to date someone that's 6 feet, but if you are a charmer, many (of course not all) women don't give a shit. Why do you think whenever there's a height post on Reddit, there are literally tons of women claiming they don't care. Because a lot of them don't!

Don't get me started with your career or your car lmao literally have not met a single woman who cared about the car that you drive. And if they do, believe me, you don't want to be with that woman. I once dated this woman. She was a pretty successful entrepreneur. We hit it off and started dating almost immediately. After 2 or 3 weeks of dating she admitted that when we were on our first date, she went on a first date with someone else not too long ago. He was a tall guy, successful investor who drove a Porsche. According to Reddit, this girl will be all over this guy but she wasn't. She even told me how boring it was on their date. On the other hand, she liked me not because of my height (I am 5'6), job (I am a graphics designer) or car (I drive a fucking Hyundai). It's because we have fun when we are together (we like doing similar things on dates and we have same sense of humor).

So why can't you get dates? It's not your fucking height or your fucking job or your fucking car. It's because you are fucking boring. Stop coming on Reddit to complain because you got rejected and then blame your height or blame women because you think they are ""superficial"". 

You got rejected because you are fucking boring bro and don't have a clue about what excites women.",[removed]

Well he just texted me his plan and it is coffee at Starbucks. I‚Äôm not doing that.

posts here always are titled ""what qualities are women looking for in men?"", and the first/top-voted comment is something like ""the triple six: 6 feet, 6 figures, and 6 pack"". it's always followed by women giving legitimate feedback and being heavily downvoted/being argued with by men.

first off, 666 is for summoning creatures not women. second, if you want to understand what women want so badly, then why do so many of you ignore them? so much of this subreddit is an echo chamber of men thinking ""are we wrong? no. it must be the women who are wrong.""

look, i understand that it can hurt to be told some of your personality is just fundamentally flawed, but that's up to you to internalize and change. of course it'd hurt to be told ""you're boring"" or something, but it's useful advice! 

nobody wants to get with a man who doesn't admit he's wrong/doesn't want to change. if you think that women are so wrong about what they want, then date men!! its 2023 ‚ò∫Ô∏è you are valid!! but, don't think that women will magically want a grumpy, stubborn, socially incapable redditor who denies any feedback he gets.

dating,10xcyfu,2023-02-08 22:29:17,"Men of all ages 18+, delete your dating apps right now!!","Hello fellow Redditors! So I was single for 3 years (January 2020- January 2023) For the 3 years that I was single I tried to use dating apps so I could go on dates with women and get to know someone. I‚Äôm telling you guys it was 3 years of hell in terms of my dating life. Women would ghost me, women would say they wanted to meet up and then just play games with me. One woman I actually started to develop feelings for but then she blocked me due to her own mental health issues (I hope she gets the help she needs) 

Needless to say I felt like I could no longer talk to women after about a year and half and I was still addicted to the dating apps! 

4 months ago back in October I decided to stop really trying on the dating apps. I still had them on my phone but I barely used them. Fast forward to New Years eve and my buddy Jack brings his girlfriend with him to our NYE party. Turns out, she brought her own friend with her! I started talking to her friend and we had some drinks and had great conversation. The night goes well and I ask her for her number, we are now officially together for a few months and we talk everyday. She is one of the sweetest women I have ever met and she is now my girlfriend. 

Moral of the story. I know it‚Äôs tough but you guys need to get off the dating apps. It‚Äôs way better to meet someone organically! The apps are so toxic and pointless. I know the saying is cheesy and cliche but it‚Äôs so true, ‚ÄúShe will come along when you least expect it‚Äù exactly what happened to me. I thought I was going to be single for a long time after giving up the dating apps. Boy was I wrong!

Now to end this I am not claiming that just Quitting dating apps will find you a girlfriend. I apologize if the post comes off like that. I personally suggest getting rid of then apps for mental health reasons and it will also help you mentally and make you want to meet someone in person. Did I get lucky with this woman? Definitely but I mentally I have felt way better and more confident since being off the dating apps anyway.","Several flaws in this post:

1. You generalize your experience with dating apps to all men and assume that deleting them will result in a better dating life for everyone. However, this may not be the case for all men, as individual experiences with dating apps vary greatly.

2. Your positive experience with meeting someone organically can be attributed to many other factors besides deleting the apps. It's possible that you became more confident, more social, or more open-minded, and these changes led to your current relationship.

3. You fail to consider alternative solutions for improving the dating app experience, such as men changing their approach to using dating apps."

dating,1099xp6,2023-01-11 17:11:00,I have a submissive boyfriend and he makes me very happy," 

I'm totally sure I'm going to be downvoted, but I don't care because I'm not writing this post to get upvotes, sharing my feelings with you is the only reason why I'm writing this post.

I'm a 25 year old woman. False modesty aside, I've been praised because of my looks my whole life, especially in high school, random people (both women and men) check me out when I go out, I tried using Tinder for fun some time ago and I literally got 30-40 likes in 1 minute and a similar amount of messages. I'm 5'10 and different people (even my female therapist) have told me I basically look quite similar to young Natalie Portman.

Everyone assumes that I put myself on a pedestal, waiting for the rich/good-looking guy who will give me the world, but I'm just not like that. I absolutely don't get any sense of satisfaction from sitting there and waiting for my man to give me the world, it's boring as hell and it makes me feel like a useless doll. I was born to lead, be strong and needed. This isn't just how I function in my dating life, this is what I'm like in general.

I met my boyfriend a year and a half ago and we immediately clicked. Relationship dynamics aside, we would talk all night about anything and have a lot of fun, we would joke all night, say cute things to each other, he's actually really nice to talk to. He's shy and a bit of an introvert, but once he feels comfortable around you, he really is cool.

He's really emotional for a guy, he's ''stereotypically feminine''. He likes cute things, he needs and wants affection, reassurance, encouragement. He's the total opposite of tough.

He seems to be really in love with me. I still catch him checking me out, and he looks like this when he does: üòç I accidentally found out he saves my selfies. He describes me (to his friends and me) as ''charismatic, strong, smart, caring, beautiful, tall'' (we're the same height). He literally called me ''his lioness'' a few weeks ago and that was a really nice compliment. I really didn't do this just to feel wanted, but a few months ago I got mad at him and nearly dumped him, he's so in love he basically panicked and he was scared for weeks after that. He would say ''I hope you'll be in my life forever, don't scare me like that again.''

We both understand society expects men ''to act like men''. When we're out in public or when we're hanging out with friends, I make him look good in front of others and I let him look like the hero. When we're alone, sometimes he even rests his head on my thighs while we're watching TV, and lets me play with his hair, or sometimes he asks me if he can rest his head on my chest. I remember it was very difficult for him to reveal his true self, he was afraid of being seen as weak and pathetic, when he realized he could do that with me, he just let himself go.

He's absolutely as important to me as I am to him. I literally don't enjoy any other dynamic in my relationships and that's why I'm incompatible with most men. Again, I was born to provide, be needed, take charge. I wasn't just crated to be someone's doll.

throwaway","Tbh none of his behavior sounds submissive. He's just opening up to you. 

You do sound slightly insufferable though - you're happy because you have a big ego and a doormat who will enable it. It's fine in the honeymoon phase, just be prepared for when the time comes that he stands his ground on some disagreement and be sure to approach that conversation, not as if he should be expected to submit, but as an equal. Just because you're more outspoken doesn't mean you speak for the relationship collectively. 

That sounds harsh but I had trouble wording it in a nicer way. My ex was like this and couldn't function when we disagreed on something. If she couldn't steamroll me, she'd pout at whatever solution I proposed. Don't be that person."
dating,10waogz,2023-02-07 19:29:06,Is there a point to dating as a woman?,"I‚Äôm starting to think there‚Äôs not. I‚Äôm 21, but already lost my libido and desire to date in general because of how I‚Äôve seen 99% of men behave. It seems most of them just view women as collectible objects (they‚Äôre obsessed with comparing us to cars in particular). Then when we get too old, sick, our bodies change after giving birth, or they just get bored, they throw us out and exchange us for a new toy. Or they at least fantasize about doing it. Look at how many men are jealous of Leo DiCaprio. They all wish they could do what he does.

I was watching tiktoks of a woman who DMs taken men to see if they‚Äôll cheat. Literally all of them do it given the chance. They‚Äôll give up decades long relationships, kids, everything, just for 10 minutes of pleasure with another woman. Especially if she‚Äôs younger, because they‚Äôre mostly obsessed with teenagers. Every woman I know got cat called the most around 12-15. Or on porn sites, all the most popular videos are petite women with pigtails, braces and stuffed animals.

They‚Äôll even say that women should just accept polygamy, because men are wired to want variety in women. It seems that we just have to accept being told we‚Äôre worthless after a certain age, that we will never be enough for a man, that the only thing that matters to them are looks, sex, and obeying all of his orders. Look at how many men say they don‚Äôt care about a woman‚Äôs intellect or sense of humor, just how hot and submissive she is. I don‚Äôt understand how I‚Äôm supposed to want a partner knowing all this. I feel very heartbroken because I‚Äôve always wanted true romantic love, but I don‚Äôt think it exists for men. And if your only response is going to be ‚Äúnot all men‚Äù or call me a misandrist, please don‚Äôt bother, because I‚Äôve already heard that before.

Edit: since all of you seem to have missed the point of my post, I‚Äôm not just talking about men I‚Äôve personally dated, since that‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs only rebuttal. This is what I‚Äôve seen from men in general. I‚Äôve seen plenty of men admit everything I‚Äôm saying out loud. Why are you acting like I‚Äôm making this up?","I hear and empathize with your frustration. I don't discount your personal experience, or what you're hearing and reading about.

I can offer that my experience, and the experience of my close male friends don't match what you're seeing, but that's to be expected. There are no viral TikToks or hot Reddit threads about boring things like kept commitments and monogamy. 

Taking time away, or deciding that dating isn't for you are OK. I hope that should you continue your search for a partner, you find someone healthy and true that shares your values.

Good luck out there--I know it can be tough."
dating,10my4ou,2023-01-27 22:29:47,I'm tired of older men being constantly shoved to younger women.,"I'm 26f. I have been looking for a serious relationship since 22. I am sick and tired of society telling me that older men (always at least 7 years old) are my only true option. 

I don't want someone that much older. I want to relate to my partner on a age level. 

But older guys are constantly shoved down my throat (metaphorically) and young guys just complain that they can't find women when it's them who refuse to be available. 

Add the societal pressure for women to marry young and ""in their prime""...marry who? My dad's golf partner? Oh no, then complain that women are gold diggers.

And it seems the same in our 20s. A lot of women I‚Äôve spoken to have certain expectations of a man, that no 24 year old could possibly fulfil. Home ownership, an above average wage, respectable car, the only men who meet that criteria are 30+."

Women have most of the power on social media, and they are exploiting that power massively. At one point is history, it was probably true to say that men objectified women more than the other way around. 

But what about today? I think that the beauty standards for men are way higher than before, and men are being objectified at alarming rates. It's incredibly dehumanizing to be an average or below average man on dating apps/social media.

dating,qyuymf,2021-11-21 13:27:42,Women: do you feel turned off by guys splitting bills on the first date/Men: do you split bills when you're not interested/financially not well off?,"Woman here. To me It's not about money. It's about the signal they send out. 

I feel splitting bills means a guy is not so interested and shows no appreciation of the time and effort you put in selecting an outfit/putting on makeup/traveling to the meeting location...
That to me is a turnoff, unless they make up for it with showing genuine interest in the conversation/asking good questions/walking you to your car, etc.

It's less about money, as I tend to offer to pay for dessert or the next date.

Do other ladies feel this way too?

Guys, why would you split bills?


Edit: someone mentioned paying for their own so they don't feel they owe anything. Yes contradictory to my opinions above, I do feel slightly uneasy if someone else bought the food I ate, so I always offer to split, and pay for follow-up things (second date, dessert). If I absolutely don't want to see this guy again, I'll ensure I split the bill so I don't owe them anything.
Most first dates are low key budget events, so I'd just like to see the guy offer and it makes me wonder about his interest if he doesn't as it shouldn't break a bank.

Edit 2: wow thanks everyone for your comments and thoughts. I like how divisive this topic seems to be. The mere fact this is still a debate in the 21 century is something.

Men: we certainly appreciate your putting in effort as well, to look presentable, to travel, and often to suggest the time and place. I always thank them for these things and compliment their humor or good grooming. And I get it, if you have to pay for Everything, it gets expensive, and how do you know she isn't just in it for a free meal, although I hope you're smart enough to suss that out pretty quickly. 

Ladies: I think we should always offer to split. Nothing wrong with paying for your own consumption. But in a setting where everything is assessed to gauge interest, the guy offering to pay is one, hence my turnoff comment. 

Someone asked why is the gesture/money used as a gauge, rather than the overall vibe, the conversations, the body language. Of course it's all the above. I've gone on to date guys who wanted to split on the first date because there were other things that went well. Why money though, even when it's usually a small amount? I guess as a woman, there's still that insecurity about when I'm having children and taking time off work and sleep deprived and all that, I want the ease of mind there's another responsible adult who can make sure my baby doesn't starve. 

Now onto gender equality: I call myself a feminist and am all for it. Why do I still have such ""backward"" views? I can certainly afford a date but still want him to offer to pay before I offer to split. I spoke about makeup and outfit and travel. Until we're in a world where a woman doesn't have to worry about her safety, doesn't have to check whether the meeting place is in a safe public space, doesn't have to text her girlfriends when she gets home safe and assure them the guy is not a creep, doesn't have to watch the uber driver when it's dark and she's drunk, until we have closed the gender pay gap, until humans really value the intellectual connection and the conversations they had rather than each other's appearances or whether she's attractive or not, until we don't turn on the TV and see 90% of the political and business leaders are men... Then, no, we don't have gender equality yet, and I'm still entitled to expect double standard.","Honestly, as a woman who believes in equality, I prefer splitting the bills. I chose to go on a date with this person. I chose the outfit and I chose to put on makeup for me, not anyone else. The other person also had to travel to the meeting location as well. I‚Äôm not looking for a man to make me financial stable nor am I looking for a man to pay for my stuff or buy me stuff. I don‚Äôt want to depend on another man and to me, it‚Äôs not about the money but the genuine connection."

Whenever a topic of conversation with a guy i‚Äôm dating comes up that ends up leading to me talk about my friends, I‚Äôm starting to get the impulse to not even mention them and just talk about my friends that are girls just to avoid the judgment or skepticism. HOWEVER, I‚Äôve always fought that impulse because I‚Äôm an open person and if I‚Äôm going to put in the effort to date someone I should be honest about who my friends are. Some guys have been okay with it, but really a lot of the time, I can just tell they feel off about it. I‚Äôve had a guy flat out ask me if I slept with either of them and was skeptical of me when I said I haven‚Äôt. They usually always say something along the lines of ‚Äúthey just want to f*** you, that‚Äôs why they‚Äôre your friend.‚Äù

One thing I don‚Äôt actually mention though because it‚Äôll just fuel whatever preconceived notions they already have about it, is that one of my guy friends admitted he had a crush on me, but nothing ended up happening and it was like ten years ago, we had a heart to heart and our friendship just grew stronger since. 

It just sucks that some guys end up being jealous over something like this, it sucks even more when it‚Äôs a guy that I really like and vibing with. The insecurity drives me crazy for real and it ruins a lot of the food that was developing. 

Whenever one of my guy friends is dating someone, their girlfriends don‚Äôt seem to have a problem with me being friends with them. Maybe one or two times it‚Äôs been a problem for them, but it definitely feels like I deal with this problem more frequently than them. 

Anyways that‚Äôs my rant, here‚Äôs to hoping I can one day find someone who I connect with and would be cool with my friends. üôè",Men know men. You clearly don't.
dating,118o5rv,2023-02-22 03:52:39,How do I (f29) ask my partner (m48) for an open relationship?,"I have caught my boyfriend talking to other women in a sexual way, photos and videos of them together and separate, he invited multiple women over while I was out of state and I‚Äôm pretty sure he has messed around with other females while we have been together. We met in a threesome and I have no problem inviting someone in often. I have never turned him down and I have a very high sex drive. I don‚Äôt care that he does these things as long as I‚Äôm told about it but he still hides it from me and lies to me, but when I mention that I‚Äôm going to start talking to other dudes he flips out. I have been flirting more often recently since there has been no change in his behavior and he has been acting like I killed his dog or something. Is it wrong of me to want an open relationship? Or is it too toxic","sounds toxic girly. if he‚Äôs being dramatic when he‚Äôs doing the same thing or even more than you, that‚Äôs pretty selfish. Some guys just seem to like the sneakiness or being with other people, and it‚Äôs hard to change that. Being in a healthy, open relationship requires a TON of communication."
dating,135vher,2023-05-02 18:04:02,36f single mom genuinely curious,"So I had my son by myself-in vitro, so there‚Äôs no dad around. I have been single 6years, since before he was born and I have not dated since, not anything beyond a 1st date like 3x I think. 
My question is: is it truly possible for a man to love a child that is not his own. Or do men only deal with kids to appease the mom? The 3 dates I went on ended after a bad reaction to me being a mom. I didn‚Äôt want to wait to tell them bc I think people deserve to know upfront as that‚Äôs a pretty big deal lol. Should I not have said anything yet? I will never date a man who sees my child as baggage. Kids are not baggage period. It‚Äôs so hard to have these very serious convos upfront as I know I‚Äôm a catch but men don‚Äôt seem to be able to get passed the fact that I procreated. And it seems manipulative to allow someone to like possibly love me,before disclosing the most important part of myself. am I just alone til kids in college? üòÖI‚Äôm a very affectionate/sexual person but I also need connection to enjoy any sexual relationship so that also means I haven‚Äôt had sex since 3 years prior to my son being born. I‚Äôm a cancer so we‚Äôre basically born porn stars lol. So, as you can imagine, I‚Äôm really struggling and my BOBs (battery operated boyfriends) are gonna go on strike soon. Where‚Äôs the guys who are sexy(not necessarily conventionally but to me), down to earth, like the outdoors, but also could be great dads? Not asking too much am I?üôÉ","There‚Äôs a ton of risk involved with dating a single mother. 

Regardless of the father situation‚Ä¶if someone is to get involved with you and then eventually the kid there is twice the heartbreak if things go south. 

I have also found it is difficult to date a single mom because the kid is the priority, as it should be, but it still makes it difficult. 

If things go even further than that a court could find the guy financially responsible for kid too. 

Is it possible for a man to love a child that is not is own?  Absolutely‚Ä¶I love my friends‚Äô kids to death and would do anything for them‚Ä¶But I am more of an uncle figure than a father figure. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm a catch‚Äù

Then why haven‚Äôt you been snatched up?  What makes you a catch in your mind?

Also it has been my experience that single moms do not like you to tell them how to raise their child.  So now I have all of this responsibility without the ability to have a say in how the child is raised.  Hmmmmmm.  

And one last thought, claiming your sexual drive is due to the date you were born is silly.  We‚Äôre grown adults‚Ä¶if you‚Äôre horny, just say so‚Ä¶you don‚Äôt need a scapegoat."
dating,11b2gm7,2023-02-24 21:21:16,I (F24) screwed up my date (M26). Don‚Äôt know how to get him back.,"TD;LR - I had unprotected sex with both my fwb and my date. I‚Äôve got Chlamydia, likely from my fwb, and it‚Äôs likely that my date would get it from me too (he‚Äôs still waiting for the test results.) My date has forgiven me but things will never be the same. I want my date back.
- Let me called him Shane. I met him on a dating app and have talked with him since Jan. We didn‚Äôt talk everyday at first and i guess both of us didn‚Äôt have feelings for each other at that time.
- But this month, he asked me out and i said yes without expecting anything. However, it went very well and ended up with sex. Few days later we went out again for a 2nd date and both of us confessed our feelings for each other. And we had sex again. Both of the dates we had unprotected sex. I asked for a condom first, then Shane showed me his negative STIs test results and then i showed mine (his was taken recently and mine was taken in Dec 2022). 
- In Jan which both of us were only texting, i had a fwb. Let me called him Aaron. I slept with Aaron in the late Jan WITHOUT a condom bc he showed me the test results of few weeks ago that were all negatives. That being said, i had unprotected with both Aaron & Shane.
- Between the 1st & 2nd date with Shane (Feb) i got my another STIs test done. The result was ready after our 2nd date and it showed that i got Chlamydia. 
- I wasn‚Äôt sure whom i got it from. Aaron? Shane? I contacted Aaron first and he blocked me right away, so i suspected Aaron got me this. (Also, Aaron told me once that he had unprotected sex with many girls but no issues about STIs at all bc he got the test done frequently.)
- Then, i contacted Shane and he was mad at me. I told him everything about Aaron. (I didn‚Äôt have sex with Aaron after I met Shane in person.) He asked me why i didn‚Äôt tell him that i had unprotected sex with a guy before him so he could use a condom. (I did ask for a condom, but i admit that i didn‚Äôt tell him about having unprotected sex with Aaron.) Yeah, that‚Äôs my bad. It‚Äôs on me. I said sorry without any excuses. I also reassured that i‚Äôll pay for the treatment if he‚Äôs got Chlamydia. 
- Now Shane is waiting for the STIs test result. He‚Äôs forgiven me but things will never be the same. I acknowledge my fault. I‚Äôve learned that i shouldn‚Äôt be relying on the test results. Just use a condom. What should i do?

*** To clarify, i didn‚Äôt cheat on Shane. We haven‚Äôt been exclusive yet. In Jan we were just texting, not even every day, after matching on a dating app. I slept with Aaron ONLY IN JAN. I met Shane in person in Feb. My mistake is that i had unprotected sex, not cheating. Also, i‚Äôd asked both of them for a condom, but they preferred unprotected sex and mistakes happened.",Tell Shane to run!
dating,wyz9gq,2022-08-27 10:12:43,I'm tired of women using me for sex,I 17m have been trying to find a loving relationship for a while now and I don't get why every girl I talk to is only interested in sex/sexual favours from me even my ex who I was with for 4 months lied about being in love with me so I would keep doing sex stuff with her and then when she did break up she said she didn't find me romanticly attractive and wanted to break up for weeks but couldn't because she found me too attractive sexually and was just using me for sex near the end of our relationship. Recently I've been talking to this other girl and she said she was also looking for a long term relationship and she thought I was attractive but when things took a sexual turn in our conversation I said no because I didn't want to do anything sexual outside of a relationship after what happend with my ex and that I thought it would be a good idea to wait and see if this becomes anything serious before we go down that route she then said she had no interest in a relationship with me and only wanted sex which would have been fine but 2 days earlier she specified that she didn't want that and she wanted something long term and led me on to believe we could have that but the second I said I wasn't gonna fuck her she decided she didn't want anything to do with me. I just don't get why nobody wants romance with me like yeah sex is great and all and I do enjoy it but I want cuddles and shi too I want romance and I want love but nobody I talk to seems to feel the same or they lead me on about wanting love only for them to lie about it and stop when they've had enough sex or I've told them I'm not going to have sex with them.

dating,12xaq00,2023-04-24 10:13:42,"He force drank water just so that he wouldn't have to give me any once I ran out, whilst hiking","I dated a guy for a few months. We once went hiking on a very hot day. He brought 3 litres of water with him whilst I only had around 1.5L. He only carried his water while I carried snacks, lunch and sunscreen for the both of us, as well as my water.

He knew how much water I had with me, from the very start. As soon as we started the hike he started force drinking. I could be wrong but I believe it was because he was worried that I would quickly run out of water and would then ask him for some of his. And to avoid this from happening, he force drank his water. 

After this hike I realised how selfish he was, and that we were not compatible. However, to this day I still wish I had communicated my frustration and disappointed about his lack of consideration for me. I often struggle with communication and being able to express my needs. How would you have handled this situation? What exact words would you have used to express your disappointed and frustration?",What reason would he have to not share water with you.

At the end of the first date she gave me a light kiss on the lips. On the second and third date, we made out multiple times through out the date with a little bit of tounge action. She let me grab her butt and put my hand on her thigh when I'm driving. She also asked to take selfies with me.

She's been calling me her baby since the second date and says typical relationship stuff like ""i miss you"" to each other.

I woke up today and asked if she wants to see me, she said ""yes baby"" and asked me ""what's the plans?"" I told her ""we can watch movies at my place""

her response was ""i don't think that's a good idea""

I have a very high sex drive and I've never dealt with this situation before because I always had sex by the second date with all my ex girlfriends. I dated 13 women so far.

She is not sexually inexperienced because she already has 2 daughters (9 year old and 5 year old)

She told me she's had 5 boyfriends.

what should i say to her? and how should i handle this situation? should i just cut her off? or should i wait until after the 4th date?",She doesn't have to have sex with you to find you attractive. She's seeing you. That means she's interested. Maybe she's just not someone who rushes into the bedroom or there might be other reasons that have nothing to do with her interest in you. I just think 3 dates is early to call it quits because of no sex I don't think that's a fair situation.

They‚Äôre tall, they work out, they make a six figure salary, they say all of their female friends wonder why they‚Äôre still single, etc. They wonder the same thing themselves. They don‚Äôt have trouble meeting women, but none of them want to stick around, and they‚Äôre often befuddled by this.

It‚Äôs because attraction isn‚Äôt based solely on having superficial qualities based on what society are desirable. Attraction is not a checklist, nor is it a points based system.

The Nice Guy believes that if he buys a woman a nice dinner, opens doors, treats her a certain way, that in return she will fall for him. False.

The same concept applies here. If you are boring, too available, too nice, you don‚Äôt have your own hobbies, you are too formal, having superficial attractive qualities will only sustain you for so long.

For instance, if you have a large circle of single female friends who tell you what a catch you are, but none of them want to date you themselves, then that is in indication that you are too subscribed to the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a catch mentality‚Äù. Here are some things to keep in mind:

There is a difference in believing you are a catch on a superficial level and that you a prize on a deeper level. When you feel like you‚Äôve marked the checkboxes-good looks, money, etc-this is the false belief of ‚Äúbeing a catch‚Äù you should avoid. That is simply a crutch for your ego. When you truly believe that you‚Äôre a prize, you believe you are interesting, unique, independent, that you offer something that most people can‚Äôt, aside from just looks or money.

You‚Äôre likely too nice/boring. This doesn‚Äôt mean you have to be an asshole, but you likely have a false White Night mentality, that since you‚Äôre this great handsome guy, you have to be overly polite, agreeable, and put the woman in your life on a pedestal.

You might be getting false feedback, or have a false self-perception of your looks. You might not be as physically attractive as you think you are. Sometimes when people encounter rejection, they inflate their self image as a defense mechanism. You have to take an honest look at yourself and your deficiencies, and work to develop those areas.

You are too available. This doesn‚Äôt mean you should be deceptive and withdraw yourself, but if you are a dynamic person, you should be busy and not readily available at the drop of a hat. If you are being active, working on your career or passion, maintaining your other personal relationships, your time will be limited. It is a turnoff for men and women alike If they person they‚Äôre seeing is willing to drop what they‚Äôre doing at the drop of a hat every single time to see them. A little bit of mystery and limited access is attractive.

Be interesting, be ballsy, be independent, be busy. Have some whimsy and some edge. Don‚Äôt assume that a woman should be happy to be with you just because of a few superficial qualities‚Äîyou have to have depth.","""just be yourself""

Can anyone lend some insight?","During my run as a single guy from 39-42, half the women I dated were from 22-26, and the other half were around 32-43 ish.

Dating attractive women in their 20‚Äôs is for fun and an ego boost‚Ä¶end of story. The beauty of these friendships is that both parties know a serious relationship will not come from it. 

The women I dated closer to my age are actual prospects for a serious relationship. Commonality is much higher in these interactions. Honestly, the sex is better too. The downside is a lot of people in this age group have had failed relationships or been emotionally hurt‚Ä¶which can be a barrier to skipping the bullshit and get to having fun with an open mind."

I‚Äôve been trying to get back out there after a break up mostly via apps but it‚Äôs hard to find anyone who is willing to put even a little effort and It‚Äôs starting to really frustrate me. 

I chatted with one guy for a few days then he said ‚Äúlet‚Äôs meet up and go for a walk‚Äù mind you he‚Äôs 28 not 21 and its been snowing lol. I just feel like men don‚Äôt want to take us out anymore or make genuine effort.

I‚Äôm beautiful by American standards but don‚Äôt do in casual sex and am always dating with intent. I have everything I want in life but a family of my own.

I believe in ‚Äúworking to live‚Äù not ‚Äúliving to work‚Äù. I am ambitious about the things I‚Äôm actually passionate about (and it pisses me off that I discovered these late but that‚Äôs another topic). But my job is just a way to make a living. It means nothing to me beyond that.

EDIT: Wow, this got a lot more attention than I expected lol. 

Anyway, if you like to travel, there's nothing wrong with that.  

After reading through some of the comments, it's clear that there's a difference between showing travel as a way to share love with someone and using it for status and attention.

He is shorter than me and begged me to date him in the beginning and was super nice. I could do better. A lot of women wouldn't want to date someone shorter for instance. But I liked his personality a lot - in the beginning. But in bed he makes fun of the way I pleasure him and when I told him I don't finish and he is the only one to finish EVERY TIME for months - he turned it around on me and said his orgasms are not amazing with me. 

Past guys I have dated have been conventionally attractive and taller than me and none ever criticized ME in bed. Is there some kind of psychological reason for this?","I dont know why you are talking about him being not attractive or short. The problem has nothing to do with that.

In there profile they say Im left leaning or Right leaning or another veriation of that, sometimes pro abotion or anti abortion.

This means there indirectly stating they have a very heavy us vs them mentality, which in honesty is commen due to everyone wanting to blame someone or something for there unhappiness.

Usually these people are stubborn in there beliefs and if you say anything out of line they will make your life hell for expressing interest in them.

Of course there always exceptions to the rule but if they put it on there dating profile consider it a red flag even if there hearts in the right place.","It‚Äôs a little bit complex, but you cannot expect a Long term, stable and happy relationship with someone who has fundamentally different values.

I am 31.
Age is just a number. In this case though the 25 year old who I‚Äôve been dating is mature in his mannerisms and he‚Äôs intellectual. However he still lives with his parents, he has a good job but he doesn‚Äôt have plans on moving out from his parents.. cos it‚Äôs a nice house, and I guess having dinner cooked for him every night is too easy not to move away from. I‚Äôm also the first ever woman he‚Äôs dated, I also took his virginity.

The older guy I have known for 3 years, we started off as friends, then started being intimate with each other but he never wanted anything serious.. and I was newly out of a relationship so I didn‚Äôt want anything either. We stopped seeing each other when I was in a relationship a year ago, and just talked as friends. Recently we‚Äôve become closer. 

I asked him recently where he sees this going, as I want a relationship and if he wasn‚Äôt serious then I would revert to going back to being platonic friends and continue getting serious with the other guy. He said he didn‚Äôt want that, and asked me to be exclusive.

Now I‚Äôm confused and hope I‚Äôm making the right decision by choosing him. 

The younger guy is very sweet, loyal and dependable. Older guy is caring, fun and the sex is way better. I feel like I have 100% trust in the young guy cos he‚Äôs innocent, older guy has been single for a long time.. He‚Äôs a good person too, I just hope he would be loyal to only me. 

They are both good people. I just don‚Äôt know long term if being with someone who‚Äôs never been in a relationship before, and still lives at home is a good match for me, but we are so compatible. I also don‚Äôt want to hurt him by ending things either.",So you put your boyfriend on hold so you could see if the older guy was better.  You are 100 percent playing the pick me game.

dating,gedu9k,2020-05-06 05:11:57,So tired of the way women with children represent themselves in online dating,"I gave up online dating because of an ultimatum: to myself I said I would be done if I saw one more ad stating 'my children come first.'

Didn't take long...within 5 minutes I was forced to quit for good. Just prior, I was so bemused with such widespread cluelessness, I took it upon myself to proactively and politely offer some unsolicited advice about not including that. It didn't go over well at all, I was backlashed harshly every time.

MY CHILDREN COME FIRST

Ya think?

A lot of guys relate to this. First, no shit. And here I thought I'd be able to usurp all those offspring you suffered for and are biologically inclined to protect.

I've read a lot of posts in social media from single mothers complaining about how undesirable they feel on the dating scene. Many not only used that opening statement, they also included photos with their kids. Why are you posting kid pics on your dating profile? Are you trying to annoy the virility out of every suitor? Don't you care about your child's safety?

Well you man magnets, you got us figured out. Men go crazy for ladies who immediately make it clear any man they date will be one of the least important things in their lives, not just sidelined, but actively  and preemptively shut down. The way to a man's heart is making it known he won't factor.

I know most of you pine about losing men to other women with fewer or no kids. If that's the case, why are so many of you acting so high-minded? I'm not saying you should dissolve all pride and settle for any low life that comes along, but you need to understand that kids are a lot of baggage someone else has to put up with. A new man knows he will never be their real father, probably never called dad, will be caught up in the drama between you and  your ex and the kids. And then there's the mommy brain syndrome that without you being aware of it, brings out mediocre traits that girls without kids just don't exhibit.

Those kids you have are not some new guy's fault, nor are they his problem. You should do everything you can to mitigate the damaged cause by the bad decision you made with that other guy. Yes, I know you love your kids and they are little miracles, but seriously, if that wasn't a bad decision you'd still be together.

Better Approach

Leave your kids out of the subject, text and photos in your ad. If the site asks if you have kids, disclose that question honestly, but only there. Don't worry, you will have plenty of chances to address this later.

Try being your authentic, adventurous self, the one that shares what she's like when she's in love with a man, or wants to be. Your life may seem boring with the kids, so share what you'd do with the time you WILL be setting aside for him!

If you don't put him first when you are supposed to be enraptured in romance, when will you? All men want their woman to be attentive. There must be a time when your man is first. Make sure your suitors know you understand this.

Ladies with kids, you ARE beautiful, sexy, fun, and alluring as you want to be. You might have to adjust your perceptions of what you want and hope. You can win the dating game if you think about how to offset the disadvantage of having kids. You need to sweeten the pot somewhere. Don't assume you can date as you did before kids, you aren't that person any longer. This isn't lowering your standards, its confronting reality. It's a good thing.",This is a lot to type out only to basically say women with kids aren't your preference. Just move on.

I‚Äôm just a high maintenance person when it comes to myself, I believe looking good goes a long way in this day and age. I don‚Äôt want to change my BF but I need him to dress better and look better for me because sometimes the clothes he wears really bothers me.

Edit: I see how this makes me sound shallow and I apologise for that. To make myself more clear, I wish he put in more effort into his hygiene.

‚Ä¢ Dating can determine your worth. If no one wants to date you, you gotta think about why that‚Äôs happening, and it‚Äôs most likely due to something you need to fix about yourself. This can be your appearance, your lifestyle, etc. 

‚Ä¢ Online dating for women is actually pretty easy. There are a lot of guys who want a serious relationship, women just need to take time to look at people‚Äôs profiles, and if you find a red flag, it‚Äôs pretty easy to leave and find a new man the next week. 

‚Ä¢ It‚Äôs good to be shallow. Dating is about finding someone you wanna spend the rest of your life with, so of course you want the best of the best. Plus, shallow people tend to know what they want and don‚Äôt want. 

Now before anyone comes at me, first off, I lost 50lbs and it made dating much easier. I‚Äôm actually happy about that, and I don‚Äôt understand why people are upset about that. I also know women who literally say they can go on dates for fun and drop guys like it‚Äôs nothing. 

So what are your unpopular opinions on dating?","Improving yourself doesn't guarantee shit in terms of dating success, trying to do x y z because it makes you more ""marketable"" is bullshit.

The only reason you should be working on yourself is for yourself, because the harsh truth is nobody else cares."

I posted a thirst trap of myself on my insta and a guy DM me. 

He told I looked sexy and I said thank you.

He asked for my name and age and I told him.

Then I was blocked. üíÄ

I'm coming to an awful realization that I won't be some men's preferences because of my age. ü•≤

Like I want to get my life together before I fully get into dating but I realized I'm only getting older and my dating options will really be limited because of it. 

I really don't know how to handle it. 

Just makes me depressed thinking about it.","I got catcalled more ten years ago (age 13) than I do now. People would approach me more in public then than now. Obviously I‚Äôm more attractive now, physically and mentally. It‚Äôs not just me, a lot of women have experienced this. It‚Äôs pretty easy to observe what‚Äôs going on: unstable men are looking for women (girls) who aren‚Äôt wise to their game yet and stable men typically arent sliding into DMs or approaching girls at gas stations. 

So in this case unstable guy slides into your DMs because you‚Äôre hot (too hot for him most likely) when he realized you‚Äôre 24 (probably have some experience under your belt) he likely assumed he couldn‚Äôt keep up and avoided rejection by blocking. 

You‚Äôve lost nothing. The only dating pool you lose as you age are the creeps who make 20-something girls uncomfortable at work. Mature, stable, well-adjusted guys will be interested in you based on shared interests/goals/values not just how you look, and they will likely build some rapport with you before ‚Äúgoing in‚Äù because they have their own boundaries and standards too."

A short and simple advice. As studies and surveys recently show about a third of women only go on dates for a free meal, so if you're a dude who who is paying for bout of you on a first date your literally just trowing money away in about 30% percent of the time. Stop thinking that you might win her over with flashy dinner because you have a better chance of return on investem if you just used that money on the lotery. And to the women who will say it's just the gentlemanly thing to do, it's also the ladylike to go to the date to actually want and to see the person there. So this social contract is broken. Plus isnt a date supposed to be the first meeting where both parties are excited to meet and see if they like each other, and not just a transaction where for the price of a sandwitch you might gate a girls attetion for half an hour. I mean dudes if you want to trow money at women to show you attention atleast get a prostitute, that way atleast you have a guranteed happy ending.",">As studies and surveys recently show about a third of women only go on dates for a free meal,

dating,13ulueg,2023-05-29 05:26:03,Is it wrong for men to desire/want women?,"I don't know how relatable or ""wrong"" this is, I'm hoping I'm not alone in this feeling so I'll try to be as detailed as I can in explaining where I'm coming from.

So I've basically suppressed my desire for women beyond non-sexual engagements because it feels so wrong to want them and be attracted to them.
As I've gotten older... I've gotten an increasing sense that it's almost a moral violation for a man to be attracted to and/or want a woman.

I've trained myself to ignore beautiful women in public, my gaze avoids them because it feels wrong to be attracted to how they look. I don't want to be a creep or be looked down upon as an admirer. I don't approach women no matter how much interest they show me. I'm attentive in conversation, but I show absolutely no romantic/sexual interest even if I'm talking to a woman that I want AND EVEN WHEN THEY APPROACH FIRST... I know that I can't allow myself to enjoy it or put my guard down because I feel like it's wrong to want to touch her and feel her and be alone with her (it's a wonder how I'm not a virgin... but virtually every woman I've been with initiated because I feel like it's fundamentally wrong for me to).

Sometimes I wish that we as men could genuinely turn desire off completely, because having that option would make life easier for me and for women collectively. So many workplace, school, and societal rules are structured strictly to address this issue of wanting.

It just seems like men wanting women is problematic and wrong. It's almost the sole reason why I stopped actively dating, despite people assuming I'm one that is successfully playing the field (and I don't explicitly tell them that, aside from this core issue I'm well socialized, empathetic, in-shape/good-looking and likable. I say that to mean, absolutely noone suspects or knows how I struggle with this). 

Is it wrong for men to be attracted to women? If I'm wrong... is it at least understandable why I think this way?",This sounds like a very unusual and strange obsession that you have.
dating,12j2wxs,2023-04-12 00:04:51,How Can I Make A Shy Guy More Confident in Asking Me Out?,"I have an acquaintance...we've known each other for over a year. He has given me a lot of clues that he's into me and I have no doubt that he is. He's a bit shy and keeps hinting at hanging out but never actually asks. I've even opened the door for him to make a move, so to speak, and he does not do it. (After he mentioned he wanted to talk to me more about something I was like yeah I want to talk to you more about this other thing...crickets...) He always hugs me, tells me how good I look, has hinted that he wants to hang out outside of the place where we generally see each other, acts jealous when he sees me talking to other guys, is always fishing to see if I'm dating someone. He also gives me very nice and original compliments about my personality, etc. Very sweet. 

I personally think it's important for a man to pursue (that's not up for debate with me - if you don't believe it, that's cool....it's just not my thing). Anyway, is there anything that I can do in this situation to get him to feel more comfortable making a move? I'm also very shy but I'm willing to do what needs to be done to make him more comfortable because I think we're a good match and I like him a lot.

The unhappiness is not a result of the relationship. Its a result of not being happy with themselves in the first place that caused them to stay with someone they didn't want to.

Source? Reddit posts and real life experience

I understand that size and shape matters, the feelings are different. There are a lot of things men can change to make themselves more attractive, but nothing can be done about penis size. HOWEVER, women CAN, for example, do kegel exercises to tighten their pelvic floor and therefore feel more when having penetrative sex. Also, I would NEVER choose to not date someone due to how tight or loose their vagina is.

Why isn't this talked about more? Perhaps so many women that enjoy only above average or huge penises would be able to equally enjoy an average or below average penis if they resorted to kegel exercises

I say this because I've seen so many reddit posts about women wanting to only date men with big penises, or ending their relationships due to penis size insatisfaction. And also because my mental health regarding this subject is declining","Consider it a favor that they're upfront about it then, because those aren't the women you want to be dating anyways. I think a lot of guys get frustrated with dating and try to justify their failures on some external factors (penis size, height, all women are the same comments, etc), when in reality the main reason they fail is because of their own limiting beliefs and self image.

I'm not saying being tall, having a big dick/money is going to hurt you. It'll definitely help you in the initial stages. However, speaking from my experience, most women are just looking for an authentic guy who cares about her and himself. Someone who believes in themselves, despite all the setbacks they've had through life. Someone with goals, ambition, and charisma. All of this breeds ""big dick energy"" without necessarily having a big dick. What they really just mean by that is pure authentic confidence. That gets developed over time by looking at every aspect of your life that you're unhappy with, and making a plan (with action) to better it.

TL;DR: focus less on worrying about what others think and more on your purpose/taking care of yourself. Relationships come naturally when you authentically love yourself."

dating,c9xg3i,2019-07-06 19:17:59,A 2 Year Personal Perspective on Dating from an Amateur Dating Coach,"Dating is draining, long, and a numbers game. It's emotionally and financially draining, and creates a lot of depression, self-deprecative thoughts, and all-around slams the self-esteem something fierce.

**Some perspective about me:** I have been dating for the past 2 years. I would guess I have gone out with over 60 woman. I am looking for marriage and children. I am educated, I have a good job, I'm fit, high morals, intelligent, have a lot of interests and skills, I'm socially adept (I'd like to think, anyway), kind and compassionate (I'd like to think), 5'10"", so not short, and I'm not that bad to look at, yet the kinds of woman I generally meet are low value, or almost always have major issues.

You hear often how men are always looking for hookups, even on women's dating profiles you constantly see so many of them feel the need to call out that they're not looking for hookups, yet I have had SO MANY woman meet me, hook up with me, then ghost or slow fade that it's insane. I've had woman invite me to their place, tell me that I'm not getting laid, then have sex with me. I've had woman tell me so many times that I am not getting laid (like it's their gift to give me, instead of something reciprocally given/shared) only to have sex with me. I've turned women down for sex and had them become belligerent, and I've been sexually assaulted by women in a way that made me very uncomfortable, though I was always physically not at risk.

The number of woman who are interested in dating and then come up with a wishy-washy excuse later is crazy. Woman who are rude about it, passive about it, and just down right lie about it is insane. On the flip side, I've had women tell me they love me a few weeks into dating. I've dated women who were bi-polar (clinically diagnosed), and more. I do most of my dating from online dating apps, and sometimes wonder if you just meet a lot of the wrong kinds of people there, but it's just so toxic for men that it's no wonder women are getting inundated with messages, many of which are sexual, and are only looking for hookups--men are sick of dealing with the game, and it's finally making me feel disillusioned and disenchanted.

I sometimes question/wonder if I want a women anymore. The toll it takes emotionally is huge. I give dating advice, and have done so for a while now, so through that I also come across many men (some women, but mostly men) who are having so many problems with females that it almost makes you wonder if the problem isn't actually just women and hypergamy conflicting with the modern world.

And when I date these girls, their story is scary in that it's ALWAYS THE SAME STORY: She was with some guy or guys who were abusive in some way. They cheated, or pushed her to cheat (it wasn't her fault, he pushed her to cheat). He is ALWAYS considered a narcissist. I have heard women on dates I've been on call their ex's narcissists almost 100% of the time. It seriously blows me away. True narcissism (according to Psychology Today) represents 1% of the population. That means I should date 100 women before I meet one who's ex was an actual narcissist. I hear these girls almost always bash their ex's, and they all tell me they were abused! If not physically, then sexually/emotionally. It's almost a 100%!

I can't help it anymore. I've read so much of the psychological and dating literature from some of the top-known relationship coaches out there. I've watched seminars, I've put it into practice and I've seen results. I've given advice to people who have seen results, yet after everything I believe and all that I know, I can't help but just become jaded. I hear these girls talk about how all they want is a good guy--someone with their life in order who will treat them well (unlike their narcissistic, abusive ex), then they lie about wanting a relationship, tell you how much of a connection they feel, have sex with you, then ghost.

You'll see them a week later with another guy, then you'll notice them back on the dating sites again because that didn't work out either.

I'm almost at a loss these days. There are amazing men out there. I talk to them. I coach them (my services by the way are completely free, though I have been considering starting a small business on it). I listen to their woes and problems and perspectives, and the problem seems more and more clear--hypergamy in the modern age isn't set up for modern day technology. It isn't set up for populations this high, communication mediums this broad, or online dating. I really believe that.

So I'll keep trying because I really want to find the love of my life. I have never even proposed to a girl because I wanted to find that perfect someone, and I've spend so much of my life self-reflecting and trying to become a better person so I could be the best husband and father ever, but finding a great women seems nigh impossible.

Give me your perspectives, gentlemen. And I wouldn't mind the female perspective too. I am not a women hater--not even in the least--I just understand the human sexual selection paradigm, and because woman sexually select, it all falls to their shoulders.","This is interesting to read, thank you. I am a 30m who isn't having much success with dating and the problem seems to be a combination of (1) People (men and women) do not prioritize relationships and dating. They prioritize career and materialism instead and don't want to make compromises. (2) Everyone is picky and wants to date up.  Like you, I get annoyed whenever a woman complains there are ""no good men"" out there. I know plenty of ""good men"" that are still single.

I'm not sure what the solution is, because how do you change what people value? Best thing I can think of is to encourage more in-person events (speed dating and such) where personality can shine through more. I would also love a dating-support-group to deal with the frustration and demoralization."
dating,11oyssg,2023-03-11 23:34:51,Hot take: I would rather be in a bad relationship than be alone.,"People keep saying that you should learn to how to be single and happy, but this comes from people who are way out of touch, who forgotten what it‚Äôs like to be single.

I value myself and what I bring into someone‚Äôs life. I want a partner not an accessory or a boss. Yeah being single and by yourself can have downsides. But there are upsides, getting to know who you are, being wholly accountable to yourself, having time to be productive or transformative.

Be strong, and understand you have value."
dating,wdut8a,2022-08-01 22:42:12,"I feel like Women proactively ignoring / staying away from men is an additional mechanism to signal to men ""If I find you physically attractive, I'll let you know. If not, stay away""","In the past women were more receptive and open to men approaching - even if they did not find the man physically attractive at first. This naturally led to more relationships as the men had opportunity to let their personality shine.

Nowadays, it seems as the women are more closed off than ever. The common feedback I notice from women is essentially ""don't even think about approaching us, unless we make it OBVIOUS that we want to be approached by YOU"".  This takes the form of women putting their headphones, their eyes down, keeping their backs to you, getting up and leaving when you sit close to them at a bar / restaurant.

Although completely understandable,  the big frustration with this approach is that it outright eliminates 95% of men out there from even getting an opportunity, based on superficial qualities. This is because the % of men that women typically find attractive without knowing their personality is incredibly small - to the extent that most men, if heeding the ""don't approach unless we make it known"", would rarely ever get any opportunities.

I get the unwanted harrassment by men they don't find attractive, but I can't help but feel as if this behavior has another purpose - to further restrict the type of man that women want to talk to, based on qualities that have little to do with a long term relationships.

in the end this is going to further distance men from women. The bar for men willl continue to rise, based on qualities that have little to do with a relationship, creating a lot of lonely women who ""refuse to settle"". While the men will meet similar fates - either loneliness or deciding to forgo dating and focus on their own adventures.

I honestly think we are quickly headed into a society where the schism between sexes continues to grow - women will choose to remain alone. Men will choose to either invest a ton of time to improve to become attractive to women or choose to focus on themselves.

Call me nuts, but I predict than in 5 years society for those ages 20-35 will look like this:

* The vast majority of women choosing to remain single rather than settle. Settle being defined as 90% of men failing to meet the ""minimum standard""
* Men will bifurcate into two groups - one group will choose to focus on themselves or their careers/hobbies, as they either don't see persuing women worth their time/effort/money or they don't meet the ""minimum standard"".  the second group of men will be the minority and will capitalize on women targeting the top % of men by living a side life of hedonism - lots of sexual partners /  women / etc.

I know I'm going to get ""durrr your'e nuts"" responses. I know I know. But in 2010, I predicted that within 10 years online dating would rule the dating landscape and people would spend thousands of dollars on optimizing their appearance  - such as hiring professional photographers for online dating and their would be a big market for online dating coaches - specializing in how to portray the coolest ""image"" rather than connecting the the opposite sex. I got laughed at ""that won't happen are you serious"".

and here we are.

curious to hear feedback on this theory/content, without questioning the messenger (ad hominem)","Women having their heads down, backs to men and earphones in has literally nothing to do with men. Women, it turns out, are people too and go out into the world to do what they want - not simply to be available to be approached and hit on. 

Glorifying the past where women used to be approachable doesn‚Äôt serve you either. People approached one another in the good old days because that‚Äôs the only option they had. Depending on how far back you want to imagine you‚Äôd also have certain social constraints that forced women to politely entertain mens conversation even if they didn‚Äôt want to. That‚Äôs nothing to point to as ‚Äúbetter‚Äù.

People are still finding each other. The assumption that only the top % of men are successfully dating is untrue. Maybe a lot of men aren‚Äôt doing well trying to win the beauty contest that is online dating but if you go out into the world and watch couples go by you‚Äôll see all kinds of couples matched up.  

A lot of them meet through work, friends and social activities and not because of cold approaching a stranger. 

To be honest your post sounds like you were going for purple pill bingo."

For me it makes sense that the man payes. It shows me that he wants to take care of me. And it allows me to step more into the femenine.

But there is also a saying in our country. Whoever initiates the meedting / date - pays. 

What do you think? ü•∞","As long as someone pays, no one has to pay. The women is allowed to consider it a dealbreaker if the man doesnt pay and the man is allowed to consider it a dealbreaker if the women expects it. Everyone is allowed their own standards, but both parties should always have at least enough on them to pay for their own meal because assuming the other will pay isnt a good call with no backup."

dating,10k8ll7,2023-01-24 15:54:01,It is possible for men to date and want to be with women with smaller breasts?,"I‚Äôm a 20 year old straight woman. I‚Äôm fit and work out. I have nice facial features and my body fits my frame perfectly. My only flaw would be that I have small boobs. My bra size is 30C but visually they look like medium sized B-cups. Throughout my 20 years of life, I have heard women (98% of them with big breasts) say that any man who is into or likes women with small breasts is ‚Äújust trying to be nice‚Äù, is desperate for a partner, insecure as they couldn‚Äôt handle a partner with big breast getting attention from other men (and that the man is scared she will cheat due to the attention), or that he‚Äôs a secret pedophile.

So I just wanted to know is it geniuely possible for a man to be 100% into a woman with smaller breasts? Like totally into her and happy with her and not wishing she was different or she could change? I really don‚Äôt want to be with a partner who feels this way about me behind my back and as a first-gen college student, I just don‚Äôt have the money for implants at the moment. That being said, I would still like to get more into dating and just don‚Äôt want this to hinder my experience in the dating world. All thoughts are welcome. Thank you.","I‚Äôm a guy, for reference.  I can assure you that is 100% possible to ‚Äúbe into‚Äù a woman with smaller breasts.  They don‚Äôt define you. You‚Äôll find someone that loves you not inspire if their smaller size, but loves you for you.  Some guys prefer it.  And most men don‚Äôt care one way or another.

Nobody actually has to reach within the deepest recesses of their inner being to make genuine, major changes in life. Nobody goes from no friends, no SO, no job, no nothing until one day they decide to hit the gym and say hi to women and suddenly they're dating left and right.  


Most people don't or should not be approaching hundreds of thousands of woman via cold approaching. Also, if you live in a small town then you likely shut yourself out of what little dating scene there was because everyone knows each other and they all know that you were 'desperate' enough to ask out every woman you could find in town.   


Nobody meets anyone through these fucking 'clubs' that you people keep bringing up like life is a Japanese anime where we all join clubs in HS or Uni. Covid has put a stop to the vast majority of any sort of social gatherings and trying to flirt with masks on is weird, not safe and just not really a situation to flirt in.  


You know how the vast majority of you people date on this sub to the point where you all make it a hobby? It's because you went to college and met your SO or you met your SO through work or through a friend. Sorry to say that not everyone can have or have had these experiences.  


So stop fucking telling people to just bootstrap your way to getting into a relationship. None of you ever had to make to serious, genuine changes in your life that shook you to your core where you had to change every facet of your personality and had to have 50 different hobbies, you're all average and vanilla af and you do the same bullshit everyone else does, you're a working stiff all week and you spend weekends on your ass streaming content or doing laundry or playing video games. Just because you went hiking one time last month doesn't make you an outdoor weekend warrior.  


All these generic, one-size-fits-all advice that you all spout as holy gospel is just mind-numbing now. Yeah, no shit you'll probably have a higher chance of scoring dates if you're fit, have the perfect personality and you're outside doing things every minute of everyday but c'mon who the fuck is actually like this in real life?","My parents met in college.

I don‚Äôt think many females realise how lonely majority of men actually are? Dating for women is like tutorial - easy mode, just put a nice photo of your self on the internet and you have 10+ guys to be your boyfriend and you could just be average looking.

A guy can be above average and still not get any dates or even get the slightest attention, a guy can go all in and be emotionally, mentally, physically and resourcefully invested and then end up getting played by girls who have 10+ guys to rotate and choose from treating guys like a option.

Guys have literally 0 to minimal demands of how a girl should be for them to be with them, but a girl has a whole list of how a guy should be for them to be a suitable candidate and guess what? They get away with it and still end up with someone and the guy doesn‚Äôt.

This is is just downright disrespectful and unfair to men.

dating,s9cdcy,2022-01-21 14:47:51,Dominant female rant/question‚Ä¶,"So hear me out‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm 32F and into men. Most of the ones I‚Äôve encountered (dating apps) are seeking submissive women. As much as I try, this is not me. Not in general at least. BUT‚Ä¶I‚Äôm noticing that with certain men that I look up to and trust, the submission comes naturally. 

I know what you‚Äôre thinking.. (omg, more of this Christian patriarchal bull sh#t and misogyny) No. and Christians are supposed to submit to each other, not just the woman to the man so anyone saying otherwise has it wrong. 

But back to what I‚Äôm trying to say‚Ä¶I get men tell me straight off the bat that they‚Äôve swiped on me because they were interested, but when they ask if I‚Äôm the dominant type or submissive, I‚Äôm not going to lie, and they ghost. 

Dominant doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm going to try and dominate the man I‚Äôm with. It means that in life, I take charge and I handle problems with ease. I don‚Äôt need much direction and I have a lot of self control (and maybe some control issues lol) What many don‚Äôt realize about dominant women is that we are reluctant to be led anywhere we don‚Äôt WANT ago go, including  away from our men by other men. We‚Äôre super headstrong and if we are faithful, good luck getting us to leave our relationships. - I‚Äôm not hear to say that submissive women will, I am just saying dominant women are not what you think we are. 

When the kids are in trouble, we‚Äôre not going to wait for you to get home and handle it or call you at work crying about what to do. We‚Äôre going to tackle the problem and you get to come home and relax OR also jump in on the action. 

When there‚Äôs a problem, we‚Äôre going to solve them together. Because there will be times when you‚Äôre too tired from work to come home and deal with the mundane dealings of family life and a wife looking to you for direction. 

Or am I missing something?

Tl;dr - I feel like a lot of people misunderstand dominant women and don‚Äôt want us. Especially men with traditional values. What is the real fear or concern they have?

Edit: If I have the definition of what it means to be a dominant woman wrong, explain to me what it means.",I think they‚Äôre referring to dominant or submissive in bed. You seem to be describing life situations in which any person would be proactive regardless of whether they‚Äôre dominant or submissive.

dating,e720ed,2019-12-06 17:54:21,I'm sick to death of hearing men complain here that they can't get laid no matter how hard they try. There must be something wrong with them.,"Here's a fact for you: surely if you're a vibrant heterosexual you should know by know that women these days have equally raging sex drives. And many of them want nothing more than a warm body to snuggle up to at night (or during their lunch break) ‚Ä¶ as long he calls (or heck, even texts!) the next day.

The problem is the're desperate and always looking to get laid. And think that women owe the sex somehow. 

Secondly they  really scared of rejection, so even if the chance comes up, they find ways to avoid it.

Here's the trouble, low confidence leads to a downward spiral and make it harder for the to get out and try.

Men need confidence and can't be scared of being cocky around women. In order to gain that confidence, they need to actually talk to women.  

How about actually trying to listen to what she has to say? How about being polite and actually offering to get to know her by taking her to dinner, or lunch, or for a damn drink at the local watering hole? 

They think apps are the end all be all, that the number of matches they get, or the number of replies they don't get, after messaging 20 girls ""Hey waz up"" somehow shapes who they are as a person. They don't realize every girl on there has gotten 30 of those same messages just today!

They think they are looking for that one pure unicorn that isn't interested in sex constantly dissing every woman out there because he's ""looking for a long-term commitment"", then he might very well never find it. Except when they are the ones to finally have the balls to send that ""waz up"" in the first place. 

They think somehow women would be offended if they make any sexual advances at all. I don't mean right out of the gate, but in a world in which casual sex is served up on the menu like a cheap steak, women these days at least expect a man to try.

They have have ridiculously high expectations. They think although they sit on their collective asses gaming day and night looking at porn, with greasy hair in the same wearing the same stinky t-shirt all weekend, that they still deserve the prettiest of Disney princess Instagram has to offer. 

That shit ain't never going to happen.

3talking about your recent ex because you're not as over him/her as you thought you were.

2Not showering/shaving/running a brush through your hair before meeting your date 

1 Bringing your kid along because you couldn't find a sitter without asking your date if it is ok first.(yes I actually once had a girl do this to me and needless to say there was no second date and not simply because she brought her kid because I get being a single mom is hard but because she barely even knew me .

Im doing everything feel like a normal person can possibly do. I have to work full time HAVE TO, to survive. I finally got a job that pays over 20 an hour and guess what I get told? ""Still not enough!""

Im about to finish a degree in industrial maintenance, because I want to repair machinery and such, and even then it wont get me THAT much of a pay raise! maybe ill make high twenties, 30 something an hour after years of experience is built up.

I get told its just not enough, its just not enough to be seen as important or valuable to anyone.

I got my own place I'm told ""not enough"" my own car well it is ""not enough""

So now I plan to get another degree after this degree so I can get into controls and such and maybe make close to 6 figs.... but its gonna be hard af working full time and getting another fucking degree but ok.

I've been alone my whole life and I'm told its my fault I deserve it and so on, I'm about to end my life and I'm fucking serious.

You think its a joke to and laugh about it, sending me DMs calling me a loser and shit.

I don't know who is calling you ""not enough"" everytime you do something that is another proof that you are a capable adult, living your own life, but if I were you I would stop asking this person and just tell them to ""fuck off"".

I've pursued a lot of guys because they said they like short women.

dating,z2cy3n,2022-11-23 02:35:15,Single due to reasons outside of my control,"Title says it all. I (24m) have never been in a relationship, and I don't ever see that changing in this lifetime. When it comes to height I am just painfully average at 5'10. Nor can I grow facial hair, which is also another disadvantage (I can't even try to grow it out because my job forces me to shave everyday). 

I try to take advice from others, and its always the same cliche BS of ""focusing on yourself."" Its good generic life advice, but its not really helping me in my situation. I've been lurking on this subreddit for a while, and unlike a lot of people on here- I actually have my shit together. I am not perfect, but I make pretty good money and I have attainable goals that I set for myself. I also am physically fit and have an athletic build. Also most of my hobbies revolves around outdoor activities. I cook, clean, groom myself (these are bare minimum things however I've seen a lot of weird things while reading some of these posts) and I even work on my car. All of these are the traditional ""masculine"" activities that women apparently find attractive. 

Anyways, I realize that I am just purely undesirable due to my mixed race. My dad is of northern European decent, and my mother is southeast Asian. And unfortunately I bare a strong resemblance of being Asian (or sometimes Latino) 

I honestly should have seen it coming because back in my college days I would be the only one out of my friend group that wouldn't get a girls number after a night going out to the bars. I have spent several times being the only one walking home alone at 3 AM. Just unwanted and overlooked. Flash forward to now, I am the only one out of my friend group who isn't married or engaged. 

I tried online dating. In a little over a year I was only able to date a little over 20 women, and the end result of all of them was a complete failure. I would talk to them via text for a few days or a few weeks in some instances, go to dinner with them, and then never hear from them again afterwards. I had a couple of situations where I thought the date went really good, but I get ghosted anyways a couple days later. Or I just keep lying to myself. Most recently, I drove 2 hours to another city, took a girl out for steak, dropped her off and drove home happy thinking I hit it off with her. I haven't heard from her since and that was nearly 3 weeks ago. 

I tried to approach women in person as well, whether it be at a bar, store, or coffee shop. Taking more advice from others. Not only were they complete failures, but they were all pretty embarrassing. I had a couple instances where they would just laugh at me. One almost seemed offended that I even had the audacity to ask for their number. I forgot the rule that only white guys who are 6'2+ with fluffy hair have the privilege of approaching women.  Society will tell us that female beauty standards are the worst thing ever (not at all saying they aren't extreme), however society would love to see the majority of men sealed away somewhere because the mere sight of them is an inconvenience. 

I don't know what to do anymore, however I do know i'd rather not be alive anymore. Sometimes I want women just to use me as avenue to get free food at this point. At least I will have the illusion of being desirable for a few hours in my meaningless existence. 

TLDR; No matter how much I try to better myself, I can't get into a relationship because of my race. However, some women would still use me for the free food.","Your personality could be a factor. 

If you are actually getting dates (20 in a year isn‚Äôt  bad actually) and none of them are turning into more that‚Äôs not because of your race. 

If you weren‚Äôt getting dates at all or were getting rejected the moment you revealed your race then maybe you could point to that, but if you have date number one it means they were attracted or interested enough to give it a try. 

Some of what you wrote in your post gives off ‚Äúpill‚Äù vibes which is incredibly unattractive to women."
dating,yw42h5,2022-11-15 17:35:52,Girlfriend won't go on birth control,"Me (28m) and my girlfriend (23f) have happily been in a relationship for about a year now. We have an incredibly healthy sex life that has recently started to cause a rift between us and it's really worrying me 

We didn't start having sex until about 6 months ago. She wasn't on birth control because she wasn't sexually active. She's never been on it before, either. 

We used condoms at first, but they gave us problems. We didn't use them for several months and it was honestly my fault. I felt terrible about having unsafe sex with her considering everything going on and it was causing her unnecessary stress every month around the time her period was supposed to arrive. So we stopped doing that. 

But lately the condom problems are popping up again. They're killing my erection, they're making me go numb, they're irritating her vagina, and they're either slipping off from the lube or they are getting dried out and constricting my dick *without* lube so they're just bad all around. I've gone through so many brands at this point. 

Sex used to be fun and intimate. Now almost all the intimacy is gone and sex is becoming frustrating for me. 

I refuse to aim my frustration at her for refusing to go on birth control. It's her choice and her freedom to do so. But she senses my frustration and it makes her feel awful even though it has nothing to do with her. I really don't know what to do. 

She says she doesn't want to go on BC because she will gain weight. I try to tell her that there are several different kinds and some might not make her gain weight as much as others, or she could try to be more aware of the side effects and adjust her habits accordingly, but she shuts the conversation down because she thinks I'm trying to force her. 

I really hate this. I've had no problems with condoms in the past as a one time thing. But as a long term solution to birth control and a long term fixture in my love life, I just can't do it. 

At this point I'm about to say it's a vasectomy or no sex because I hate them that much. 

What should we do?",I love birth control and will ride that shit into menopause but you can‚Äôt expect her to pump her body full of hormones she doesn‚Äôt want because you both don‚Äôt like condoms. Def other brands and or doctor intervention

As of today, I have turned off Tinder and OKcupid. 

I cannot keep up with the messages and have received more interest than I have free hours in the day. 

Point is....

Don't give up, keep doing things for you. Don't chase women. 

Women will notice you for you  and will be interested in you. 

Things do get better.","What?!  Most men on here are struggling to even get matches.  You're telling them that you're killing it, get too much attention, and so all the men on here should just ""stop chasing"".

Spoiler Alert:. Chasing too much isn't the problem with most guys on here"

dating,1247sk9,2023-03-28 01:13:34,Are men afraid of dating successful independent women?,"So I‚Äôve been on a couple dates with this guy and everything was going well.  We talk and as soon as I disclosed what I did, where I went to school, and what my ambitions were, I was ghosted.  Similarly, with another guy, I got the ‚Äúoh I feel like you‚Äôre too good for me‚Äù.  Another guy, I admire you, but I‚Äôm looking for a girl that‚Äôs more into family and less about her career.  I‚Äôm so taken aback, are we back to the 50s?  Women can‚Äôt have a family and have ambitions or a good job?  I talked to my guy friend and he said yea, some guys don‚Äôt like when a woman makes more than them, or are more established than them.  Is this for real?  Am I now expected to play dumb and wear an apron cooking/cleaning all day? #frustrated

Edit: the comments below did give me an opportunity to self-reflect and I appreciate that.  I first would like to clarify that I‚Äôm not Sheryl Sandburg (although I wish!).  I am not some high profile executive pulling in millions.  üòÇ secondly, I am honestly astonished by the number of responses that put women in a stereotypical gender role under the guise of men/women biological instincts.  At least to me, these roles are antiquated and I hope that we have moved on from that mindset.  I totally get that some women choose to be housewives and if that works for them great!  But to insinuate that you have less motherly instincts or that you‚Äôre less family oriented bc you have a career and have dreams/ambitions outside the confines of the house is very wrong IMO.  Like what if someone said that to your daughter or your sister?  Wouldn‚Äôt you feel eek?  I personally work a lot, but I have very flexible hours.  With my exes, I was always the one cooking, grocery shopping, cleaning bc I had the time.  I was the one who was pushing for a baby.  I think when there is a true partnership, it can work.  

But let me clear about something.  I am not successful or educated or ambitious bc of some pride or ego thing.  In fact, it just kinda happened.  One of the most valuable lesson my mother has ever taught me is to be financially independent and educated.  Why?  Bc time and time again, we see women sacrifice everything to be the care taker of the house only to find out her husband cheated, her husband was violent, or husband died unexpectedly and they end up completely helpless.  That‚Äôs why I was raised w the same opportunities as my brothers and never once told that this is a girls job or this is a boys job.  But having a job and being successful is not necessarily a masculine quality.  I still embrace my femininity (love makeup, love heels, love to dress up, lingerie, etc) and while I do enjoy the finer things in life, I equally enjoy the simple things in life.  But i guess I get the fact that I am very type A and Tom boy-ish, so I guess I‚Äôll need to work on that cos I can see how it can be a turn off for some guys","Personally, I don't mind a woman having a more successful career than me, more money, more friends, or having a more successful life in general. If anything it means if things progress, I actually get to share my life with her, and that sounds awesome. 

In modern dating though, I think a question is on every guy's mind when he's dating a woman like that : why'd she pick me? Doesn't she have other options? Also, when a women tells me she's independent I think ""what can I contribute to her, to our relationship? Does she even need me for anything?"" As a man, I like to be needed, to be wanted, to be loved. She doesn't need to depend on me 100% like I'm her master or something, but I like to feel wanted. I think most men feel like they get that less today, so they'd rather not be in a relationship at all. It saves heartbreak."
dating,vin5rg,2022-06-23 03:23:05,Males dating females with higher education,"Hi all,

What are your thoughts on males dating females who have higher education? For example, a male with a bachelor‚Äôs degree and a female with a master‚Äôs or a PhD degree? If you have been through that experience (dating and even marriage if applicable), how was it like?

Edit: I was advised to not date females with higher degrees because such females are more aggressive and have shorter temper than those who don‚Äôt. However, based on what I saw on dating apps, a majority of those candidates in my desired pool have masters or even PhDs. Based on the advice of not dating such females, there seems to not be a lot of choices in my desired pool.",There‚Äôs no correlation between higher levels of education and having temper or aggression issues.

The people who can‚Äôt let it go are generally the reason for why ghosting happens.

If it's the super early stages of a new relationship, sure I'd agree with you, but a man who I was with for years, and friends with for many more, told me he loved me and then he ghosted me. We hadn't fought and it was out of the blue.

dating,q8tl8v,2021-10-15 17:47:13,Why women in their thirties don‚Äôt like it when men their age date significant younger (especially for relationship),"Hallo together,
my personal (male mid thirty) experience is that women my age react quite harsh, when men date younger. And I don‚Äôt even talk about really young (40-20), even if I as 36 male would date a 25-27 year old one, from women my age there would come pretty bad feedback. Especially if I am looking for a relationship (casual sex would be more ok). From my perspective that age (also up to 30-32) is a good fit, when it comes to starting a family (not immediately but in the next years‚Ä¶). If I would just would like to fuck around that would be ‚Äûnot good‚Äú but far more tolerable for them as to say ‚ÄûI am looking for a women with an age at maximum up to 32 to start a family‚Äú. The classic answer is: ‚ÄûThat‚Äôs unfair you are 36 you should also consider older ones‚Äú Even that I have to focus on the ones my age is sometimes an outcome.

That comes from all kind of women, women that know me well or not really,that are in a relationship or not‚Ä¶. To be frank as soon as they are in their thirties (and i normally don‚Äôt tell like exact the ‚Äûend dating age‚Äú) they get really pissed when it comes to, ‚Äûlooking for a younger one to start a family.‚Äú And i always explain that I am looking for a real partner, with a real connection. I find that confusing.




Explantation of that age range that I am looking for, just to be clear: I want 2-3 kids, I want time to know and develop an meaningful relationship with my partner before getting kids. Money is not a real problem, but it would be important for me to have a wife that could work as well to have something on carrer and personalside as well. I myself were several years really focused on career (maybe a bit too much) and needed the time to develop as person and man ( had a long term relationship of 10years that cracked because we were not able to get kids.). To be honest my main point is just biological if I want 2-3 years before first kids and then 2-3at all, it will be rough with a women my age. The women in the range 25-32 are on the samephase as I am (i don‚Äôt date party girls for serious relationships).","It's not that you're telling women this that makes them mad, it's that you're rubbing their nose in it for some reason.

dating,102pokh,2023-01-04 01:14:40,"Why do women complain that they're not being paid equally as men and simultaneously avoids men who makes less than them, let alone broke as a partner?","So which do they want? Do they want to make at least equal to men or do they want their men to make more than themselves? Or do they want to make equal as men in general, but only when it comes to their ""partner"" they want somebody that's more financially successful? Why do they have this double standard?","That doesn‚Äôt even logically make sense. 

Women want to be paid the same for the same job. If I do the exact same job as a man, and we have equal backgrounds there is no reason why that man should make more money than me for doing the same work. 

Wanting someone to be fiscally independent has nothing to do with that. The generalization that women won‚Äôt date men who don‚Äôt make X amount or makes more than them is stupid. Almost all of my long term relationships were with men who have made less money than I do. I only cared that they could take care of themselves. 

You‚Äôre just making connections to assumptions that have nothing to do with each other and aren‚Äôt even correct."
dating,10a8ymw,2023-01-12 19:57:36,pretended not to know Pink Floyd to see the reaction of the girl I am seeing,"Today I hung out again with the girl I am seeing.
We drove to the city I suggested visiting and she was  so happy when I added that she could mess up with the radio. Since she wasnt satisfied with the radio, she used her own phone to connect It with the stereo in my car.

Then I did one of my tricks: I chested and lied to her :)

She strangely put on Shine on you Crazy diamond by Pink Floyd. One of my fave songs.

As It started she asked me: have you ever heard a 13 min long song? I said no (I lied) and she was like, how can you not know them??? 
Then she proceeded to talk to me about how Pink Floyd was more about space and music than stardom, about the images she sees when she hears the songs, she literally sees colors while listening to their songs, she told me the story behind the song, I pretended not to know it, and  she told me to pay attention to the words they used on the refrain (come on you stranger you Legend you Piper etc...) And she was SO ENTHUSIAST i could not hold the lie anymore.

So I asked about the names of the band members, she forgot one and I stepped in, she was shocked to know I lied all the time, made a cheeky smile and gave me a super light punch on the arm, and said ""you liar, I cant believe It"" I laughed and honestly It was so much fun. I had never seen a girl choosing a psychedelic rock song for a car trip. 

I will marry  this girl. She has the same taste the same opinions as me, she admires me, thinks I am handsome, she trusts me, she feels the music, she Is beautiful, sensitive and sweet and she looks gorgeous wearing those old fashioned dresses with leggins underneath. And most important, she doesnt snore!! She's quiet in bed and doesnt steal blankets. She hugs me in her sleep and nuzzles her face on my arms or chest. She's sweet and caring 

God, thank you for creating her. I never had the chance to discuss Shine on you Crazy diamond, soccer or anything deep with anyone of my guy Friends. So thanks for creating her, all for me.",This is both incredibly cringe and really manipulative.

I sometimes get a bit lonely but on the whole I'm very happy with my life and finding my person should just add to my already full life. BUT the constant barrier I seem to find myself with is related to dogs üòÇüòÇüòÇ 

I am not a dog person, I don't want a dog ever in my life, I have my reasons. I appreciate a cute photo of a dog or looking at them walk by in the park, and the very occasional stroke.

The reality is that for pet owners it is. 

These are animals we have chosen to own and they are our responsibility until they pass on. 

Wanting someone to rehome their pet for you would be considered wholly unreasonable. 

Being with someone who is ambivalent to your pet is one thing, being resistant is another.

So you either need to be up front about not seeing pets as part of your future plans or accept the fact that you'll be going on dates with men who will not meet your criteria and vice versa."
dating,127pg0d,2023-03-31 15:42:03,So I have this move I do on EVERY first date I go on...,"So a bit of background for context, I worked as a professional matchmaker and life coach for a company called ""It's Just Lunch"" for about 6 years, I set up dates and handled feedback and maintenance calls with clients both women and men over the course of that time and I learned a great deal about how women think when it comes to dating during that time.

&#x200B;

So I decided to do something everytime I go on a first date, I call it a heat check. So I am always picking up the bill for first dates and I like to order a drink, engage in conversation and once she's done with drink one, usually this is 30 minutes to am hour into the date at this point, I stop her. ‚úãüèæ  I tell her that I'm having a great time (if I am) I'm enjoying the date and the conversation but what I've come to know for a fact over my years of dating and matchmaking is that women don't always feel comfortable being honest, direct and straightforward about how they feel on dates. Sometimes they feel like they want to leave by they are afraid they don't know how the guys going to react etc. So I tell them at this point I'm giving them an out, if for ANY reason they want to leave, they don't find me attractive in person, they think the conversation is boring, they just don't feel the chemistry etc they have a free pass to go, no hard feelings. I paid for the check already or the bartender has my card so they can go. I then tell them I'm going to the bathroom, I'm going there for 3 minutes so they don't have to do this to my face if they feel uncomfortable. If they want to leave, call and Uber get out of there they are welcome to do so. I don't like to get phone numbers of women on dating apps, I prefer to meet and if there is a connection, and she wants to give it me, then we can exchange numbers so that I don't have it if she doesn't want to see me again. I try to get minimal personal information, I don't know where you live or work or your last name so I will not be able to find you should you leave. This benefits us both, if you want to leave but feel uncomfortable and don't want to hurt my feelings then you are free to go. For me, I don't want to waste time, money or energy on a woman who doesn't want to be on the date with me, everybody wins. 

&#x200B;

In keeping track of this strategy I've done this on 43 first dates so far. In 43/43 dates no woman has ever taken advantage of this and left. They all usually laugh and say no I would never do that. When I come back from the bathroom they have all been there and the dates have continued on anywhere from an hour to 4 hours longer after that, this obviously varies from woman to woman. And yet, I ended up dating exactly zero of these women long term. In fact most of them ended up sending me the dreaded ""I don't think we have enough chemistry"" text after the date which was puzzling for the ones who stayed for another 2 to 3 hours plus.

&#x200B;

I have a lot more context to add to this. And I feel like people will have questions so Instead of continuing to explain in greater detail I'll await questions. But i will say one thing, I protect my peace. I've found that reddit like many places has a lot of assholes, if your goal in responding to this post is to attack me and try to make me feel bad, I will simply block you, I don't engage with people who make arguments in bad faith. Feel free to disagree with me and make counterarguments I'm good with that, but if your goal is to call me not confident and attack my integrity just go ahead and block me first because I won't be chatting with you.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Thanks and let me know what you think of this!","Horrible advice, this ""strategy"" just communicates insecurity (even if you maybe is not). The fact that 43/43 has stayed after you pull this thing is not evidence that your strategy is working, its rather evidence that the strategy is meaningless because they did not want to leave in the first place..."

Why are women so obsessed with their preferences? 

Example - "" I only date guys over 6ft tall""","I don't think women are any more obsessed with standards than men are. I remember back when i was still dating there were plenty of male dating profiles saying things like ""no fat chicks"" or ""blonds only"". So it definitely aren't just women.

dating,vnh6fs,2022-06-29 14:31:09,Online Dating is NOT about Finding a LTR Anymore.,"In my experiences and opinion, online dating is not about finding a long-term relationship anymore.  I know that there is no simple solution to fix online dating. There are several key factors that need to be dealt with:

1) There are more men online than women. So men are dying of thirst in the middle of a desert and women are dying of thirst in the middle of the ocean.

2) Women feel 'validated' by having 'all of those men' chase after them online.

3) Women are only interested in the top 10 percent of men. (Men 'must' be over 6 feet tall, fit, good looking, make over 100k a year, have a big D, pay for all of the dates, and entertain them. etc.) Yet most men just want a lady that looks cute and have a chemistry with them. (Yes, men are attracted to looks, but they also know a relationship is more than looks. How often do you see out and about a larger woman with a better looking man? Rarely do you see it the other way, and if you do, you assume he has money.)

4) The top 10 percent of men are chased by 90 percent of the women and thus those men can be 'non-committal' and be 'players'. 

5) Women are not happy because the men that they are chasing are not interested in a relationship with them, but refuse to 'settle' for what they consider 'lesser' men. It is not settling, it is managing your expectations and facing reality. 

6) Women call the other 90 percent of men that they find undesirable, 'creep', 'pervert', 'just a friend', etc. (Eww, how dare he approach me at a bar! What a creep!)

7) A part of problem is too many outside influences such as friends, Hallmark Channel, Romance Movies and Books, Postmodern Feminism, Current Laws, are all slanted to let women believe that they can 'Have their cake and eat it too.' 

8) Most men would be happy with just a single woman who loved them for themselves, and respect them. Women want more and are never satisfied. (More than 60 percent of all divorces are initiated by women who are not happy.)

9) Women want to be chased by the men they want. They want to be entertained by the men they want. They do not want to put much effort in keeping the man engaged with them. If all you have are your 'good looks', then you don't have much to offer a guy. (A lot of women have a self-inflated opinion of themselves and their looks.)

10) In order for a man to 'get' a gal online, he has to be a 'player' of some sort. A lot of men are just not players. 

11) Dating websites are geared towards getting men to spend money to talk to the women. Not so much the other way around.

All I ever wanted was someone to be a partner in life, to share the good times and bad times with. Instead, I keep finding women who are just interested in a free meal when I take them out, or to be entertained or just want money. At this point, I've given up with online dating. I still have a profile on various dating websites. Mostly to just browse when I'm bored and a bit lonely. But I do not reach out or 'favorite' or 'like' anyone's profiles. (Because that would 'validate' their profiles.)

I am not there yet, but I can see why there is a growing trend of 'Men Going Their Own Way'.",You might get somewhere if you actually understood *why* women initiate divorces rather than claiming it‚Äôs because we‚Äôre *never satisfied*.

I downloaded during Covid lockdown, I was slightly sick. I did it just as a joke without expectation
The worst part is every man I come to contact with just wants to abuse my trust really fast without even knowing me in person yet.
A lot of them are used to use and discard girls there just for the fun of it

And having so many options in their hands on Whatsapp. Perhaps even doing routine hook ups with these girls 

One of them blocked me after he had a girlfriend for two months. After he breaks up with her girlfriend though we never speak again. Others without knowing me would just block me out of the blue without any reason to do so

Tinder - the women on there do not know how to say anything past hey how are you?

But I used to be a fuckboy.

Oh, yes. All the things that get complained out on Reddit dating sites? I did them. Stringing people along without committing? Common for me. Having sex but then busting out the ""not looking for anything"" line? I did it. Commitment-phobia? Big time. Emotionally unavailable? Very. Ghosting? My phone didn't even recognize the word ""bye"" after a while. I had a bunch of fuckboy friends. Some are now married. some are not.

I know what you're asking right now. But no, I don't want your number or your snapchat.

So, what happened? How does a legendary fuckboy like me end up married, committed and happy? Well, I found someone worth committing to. Someone unique, who, in losing, I would never find again. Someone who is a real catch. In short, I found someone is good enough. 

That's the thing about fuckboys. They're not stupid. They just don't commit until they know that they found someone to whom it is appealing to commit.",Yeah the problem is that along the way you screw up other people's worthy partners and ruining them.
dating,13i4oxh,2023-05-15 10:48:11,How can we make online dating safer?,"I am DONE tolerating harassment on dating platforms like Bumble. I envision a world where we are equipped to warn our fellow daters about those who fail to respect boundaries and display inappropriate behavior.

  
What if we had the power to shine a light on these individuals, not for revenge, but for the protection of our community? Imagine an anonymous review feature that allows us to share our experiences and insights about our dates. These reviews would be available as a summary on the user's profile, providing valuable information to others before they even swipe right while not exposing the individual reviewer.

  
This is not just about exposing those who do not understand respect and consent; it is about cultivating a culture of accountability, respect, and safety within our dating environments.  
I am prepared to dedicate myself to this cause, to sift through the crowd and highlight those who pose a potential threat. By doing so, we can ensure that they do not find another victim, another person left feeling objectified, disrespected, or worse.

  
This isn't just a feature - it's a MOVEMENT. It's about ensuring our voices are heard, our experiences validated, and our safety prioritized. Who's with me in demanding more from our dating apps? I'd love to hear your thoughts.","Problem is that a lot of people will abuse this, and it will rapidly degenerate to a shit show, where the apps become completely unusable for most users, and the companies probably know this, and their goal is to make money, which they won't if noone can use their apps.

dating,1055s31,2023-01-06 21:16:29,"I would like to have a relationship, but I genuinely do not find a reason to date girls. Am I missing something?","I'm a 25 year old guy, I'm totally straight.  I've genuinely questioned my sexuality, I'm an open-minded person and if I was gay or bisexual I'd be honest with myself and start dating guys, but I'm straight.

My problem is that even though I like women, physical attraction isn't enough for me. If the most attractive girl on the planet walks past me on the sidewalk, I won't even notice. She could be half naked and I still won't care.

I only value what a woman brings to the table. It doesn't matter if what she offers is financial support, emotional support or something else, what matters is that she has to bring something to the table that makes me want to date her,  and then I'll try to understand if I find her attractive.  I've only had 3 relationships in my life (I'll talk about the last one later)

The problem is that I feel like men like me have no place in the dating market. I meet a woman and she'll just start giving me a lot of hints.  False modesty aside, I'm not an ugly guy at all, women giving me hints is not a very rare occurrance. But if even if she's giving me the green light to go ahead, I do not find a reason to go ahead because if you're just sitting there and giving me hints, then you're basically just hoping I find you attractive sexually, you're not really doing anything to make me want to date you.

I'll talk about the last relationship that I had: I meet this girl in University. She was very cute, not my type, but I eventually fell for her.

She found me attractive immediately and asked ''what's your name?''. She would sit next to me during the classes and try to tease me.  She would rub her leg against mine under the desk, touch my arm a lot during conversations etc. She would go out of her way to help me with the studies. She did that for a few months, I was initially indifferent to her, I just thought she was a nice girl, but I wasn't into her. At some point I realized ''this girl is cute and she's a very kind person, I think I'm in love''. Now this is a girl who gave me real reasons to take things further, she didn't just sit there and wait for me to do the rest of the work, I won't do that because looks alone don't turn me on. I think I've explained pretty clearly how I function. But unfortunately women like this are the exception, I wish they were the rule.

I'm starting to think I'll only have a woman when I want to start a family, having kids and a family may be a good reason for me to seek a relationship and make an effort,  but this means I'll have to stay single for many years. I just do not look at a woman and think ''I want her''.

I cannot change how I function, I'd have to go get a different brain that works differently. What am I supposed to do?",The purpose of going on dates is to learn about the person and find out if they have things to offer. No one is going to know if someone has anything to offer unless they‚Äôve spent some time with that person.
dating,zq14an,2022-12-19 19:32:02,I love him to pieces but he doesn‚Äôt turn me on.,"This will be relatively long one but stick with me, I‚Äôd really love some advice‚Ä¶

I'm 27 and I‚Äôve been dating a guy for 6 months. He‚Äôs amazing, he treats me amazingly, we have soooo much fun together, are so comfortable with one another‚Ä¶ I genuinely couldn‚Äôt find a bad thing to say about him.The only thing is that our physical relationship isn‚Äôt great. For me anyway. 

He is an attractive guy. He makes me feel beautiful, and when we first started dating the sex was fine. I am a hugely sexual person and always have been. Probably one of my problems is most of my past relationships has always been based on sex. The type of relationship where we can‚Äôt keep our hands off each other, out of this world kind of sex‚Ä¶ but they have never worked out because that‚Äôs all it was.

Now I have met someone who is perfect, but he can't turn me on. If we do have sex, I do it to get it over with. I know I could speak to him about it. I also know that he isn‚Äôt as sexually experienced as I am. Personally, for me, sexual attraction is either there or it isn‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt want to be someone‚Äôs mentor.

Friends advice is not to throw something away that feels so right just because the sex isn‚Äôt great. That attraction dies eventually, and growing old with someone you love and can be happy with is more important.

I don't want to end things over it because we have so many other wonderful aspects to our relationship, but it's something I want and need in a relationship.

dating,11knbxh,2023-03-07 03:09:03,"My son's are good looking athletic and hardworking, and can't find girls. How can I help them?"," EDITED
Ladies, please help me to help my sons. Yes, they're on the usual dating apps, but never seem to get many actual dates out of it. My sons chose to leave good paying jobs and even left their homeland because they didn't agree with the politics there. They are  good-looking, athletic and hard working. WHERE CAN MY SONS GO TO FIND WOMEN OF SUBSTANCE? This is a sincere question, so please, only sincere responses.
(EDIT/CLARIFICATION BY OP)
Thank you so much for those of you who responded to my question in sincerity and with a desire to be helpful. Many of your responses were helpful or at least encouraging. There were many other responses that seemed to genuinely misconstrue my intentions and offered advice that was consistent with mistaken suppositions about me and my intentions. And then, sadly there were some who seemed intent on being as insulting or rude as possible. To those who simply misconstrued my question, I offer these clarifications. If, after reading the clarification, you have some suggestions that might be helpful to any man wanting to meet girls in the modern dating world, please feel free to follow up. 

1.  The question I originally asked is: ""where can my sons go to find women of substance?"". My point here was to ask the young women of Reddit, ""where can my sons look to find you?"".  My question was NOT, ""how can I interfere in my sons' romantic and sexual lives"". 
2. I'm their Dad. I'm asking the question because things have changed in the dating world since I was there. I thought Reddit might be a way for me to learn something that helps them to be more effective in their search. My sons often ask my advice about life and have repeatedly expressed frustration with the difficulty meeting young women. 
3. My son's politics, looks, upbringing, attitudes etc are really not relevant to this conversation. I'm simply looking for insights that would work for ANY man in the dating world. 
4. The only reason I brought up politics, was as a measure of the character that my sons have. It takes courage and conviction to be willing to leave jobs, friends and country to live up to your ideals. I would have thought that their willingness to sacrifice for their convictions (right or wrong) would be a good measuring stick for a young woman trying to ascertain what kind of men they are. 
5. What do I mean by the phrase ""woman of substance""?. I mean a woman who is kind, courageous, hardworking, has a sense of humor, and an open mind.  A woman of substance is firmly committed to overcome adversity and be her best self and live her best life. I'm sure that I could expand on this definition but I think you get my drift.
6. I feel a fatherly compulsion to defend my sons, so here we go. They have faults of course, but they are the kind of people you would hope come along if you were in distress or in danger or just needed a friend. Many times, I have seen them act with compassion and integrity when they think no one is watching. In short, they are men of substance.","As a son, please for the love of god stay out of it. If you get involved you'll make it look so much worse. Imagine you're an adult at a university or you're interviewing at a job, and your mom is at the office WITH you at reception. How bad do you think that looks? 

There is not a single mom on this planet that think their sons are ugly, your opinion doesn't count."

I truly don't understand how people meet others organically anymore, and I don't really understand the pressure behind meeting someone this way vs. online. A lot of people on here complain about a lack of dates, yet refuse to put themselves out there and even give online dating a chance. In the past few years, online dating has become so normalized and acceptable that people are very open about using dating apps and their online dating practices. Even in the past year, with everything going on in the world, it's nearly impossible to meet someone organically since we don't have the freedom to go out like we once did.

Should I be offended that a guy doesn‚Äôt want to take me to dinner and only invite me for a drink?‚Ä¶ It makes me feel just a tad less and like maybe they don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm worth their time and resources.,"Asking a girl out for coffee/drinks is pretty common, and is a simple, low risk way to find out whether you're going to vibe with a person or not. Dinner is something you save once you're acquainted with someone. I would never ask a girl out for dinner as a first date/meeting because what happens if we don't vibe? We both have to sit there awkwardly eating our dinner and have no means of escape if it turns sour. Having a coffee/drink date means that I can quickly chug it down if things aren't going well. I wouldn't be a offended by that, it's the norm nowadays."
dating,m82ccm,2021-03-18 22:21:37,"If you‚Äôre dating someone and that person throws any hints about how he or she isn‚Äôt certain about your relationship, end it immediately.","I don‚Äôt care what excuse the other person makes. 

I‚Äôm going through a lot. Theyre having anxiety or depression or something else..ok that‚Äôs fine...but if you want to date long term, what are you going to do if you have post partum depression after the baby is born...what are you going to do if you‚Äôve dated and you find out one of you has a chronic condition...would you run then too? 

I‚Äôm busy at work but I won‚Äôt offer a time I will be free to spend time with you. 

Our chemistry isn‚Äôt the same as it used to be. 

End it. 

Excuses as valid as some might be are at the end of the day...excuses. 

If you want a relationship to work, you need to see the other person is fully committed to making what you guys have work. Dating an indecisive person is like stabbing yourself with multiple small wounds until a big one eventually comes. Don‚Äôt put yourself through that shit.","This isn't really good advice, at least not as presented. There have been many situations where I wasn't certain and then decided I was. It's certainly a discussion to have if you're feeling that way or getting those vibes from someone but it's not a black and white issue. Healthy relationships can still have uncertainty, it's normal and part of being healthy. It doesn't mean they're indecisive, it means life is complicated and so are feelings. It doesn't mean someone is making excuses, either.

That's totally different than someone being unwilling to make time for you. That's not uncertainty. If someone doesn't have time for you, and they aren't able to meet your needs, and you have no reason to believe it is temporary, sure that could be a reason to end it. But life gets busy sometimes. If you are serious about someone, a reasonable amount of waiting is appropriate and healthy.

Someone saying the chemistry isn't the same can qualify as uncertainty, but it's also not a reason to immediately end a relationship if you're genuinely interested in them either. Sometimes things need to be rekindled. Relationships take effort to maintain, and if someone cares about you enough to have that discussion (where they're telling you the chemistry is fading) that's actually a pretty good sign that they want to work it out and fix it. Otherwise they'd just leave.

So it sounds like you're conflating a lot of different scenarios that really aren't the same."

One month before he came here he told me in a very subtle and hurtful way that he was worried about my body (i'm 5'8 and I have an athletic build, not fat, he's 5'9 normal/small frame) and that he has always been with very skinny petite girls (lots of comparison with his ex). we discussed a bit, I was annoyed but said that if it was his preference  I couldn't do anything but he should have communicated it to me before instead of making nasty subtle comments.  
The next day he apologizes profusely, saying that he let his mind get the best of him, that I'm attractive, and a lot of other bs. So another month passes by with him pretending to like me.  
We meet, and he gets physical immediately (so i think he likes me), I let it play out but it's all extremely rough (besides doing something non-consensual). I could feel a very weird energy and I communicated it to him. After a lot of bullshitting, 3 days after he finally admits what's the truth.  
He doesn't find me attractive. He also criticizes my life, my house, my car, my bedsheets, and the fact that I watch Youtube. EVERYTHING. He tells me that I have a lot of darkness inside me and more. that he should have listened to his gut feeling and not come. ah he also used the things i told him about my past against me. (the bad experiences I had)
He knew what I think about casual sex (i had been celibate for 1 year and I don't have sex unless there is an emotional connection). but he said that he wanted to see if the sexual chemistry could have dissipated what he felt inside.  
If u don't find someone attractive what kind of sexual chemistry u can have????????  


MAKE IT MAKE SENSE

funny part is, he's a small crooked D, has no career, little money, and has been living in his car for the past  6 months but somehow feels like a catch and that he can throw shit at everything I have and I am. I like taller and bigger men but I gave him a chance bc I thought he was special.....look how turned out","Lol I date him for 5 years, lived with him, we got pregnant. He proposed. I gave birth, and then 3 weeks later he breaks up with me and tells me he‚Äôs not attracted to me, he doesn‚Äôt love me or even like me, he doesn‚Äôt respect me, my vagina is too loose to have enjoyable sex with, and the only reason he was with me was because he was lonely and going through a hard time. Now I lay here in my parents basement with my 2 month old daughter. And he has a new gf. So to answer your question, yes. You can get lower"
dating,10cqqo8,2023-01-15 18:20:35,Not mathematically possible,"There are frequently posts and comments on this forum indicating that the vast majority of women are chasing the top minority of men. I've heard this from male friends IRL as well. There is also a theme that a young man must basically perfect himself (gym, career, therapy) before he will ""win"" a woman as a mate. I just read a post from a 21-year-old male asking if he should improve himself for the rest of the decade and date in his 30s. 9 years of self improvement to be good enough to date???? You can earn a law or medical degree in less than 9 years. Do we really think the average man attracting an average woman requires more dedicated effort than a graduate degree?

The math for these concepts doesn't add up. According to a random CDC publication I googled out of curiosity, the probability that men will marry by age 40 is 81% compared to an 86% probability for women. So, while women do marry at a higher rate, the difference is slight. The vast majority of both sexes will, in fact, find a marriage partner by age 40. Even more may not legally marry but enter satisfying romantic unions during that time.

So it just isn't possible that four our of five men are perpetually overlooked. If that were true, who are these women marrying? Doesn't it seem much more likely that this is the perception because the majority of single men are also chasing the top tier of available women? Perhaps because those are the women you notice on IG and out at the clubs? I often wonder if men sort of don't notice less traditionally attractive women, don't show interest in them, and then complain that ""no"" women will have them.

At some point before age 40, about 75% of both sexes have married, so isn't the most likely reality that both sexes are chasing partners who are ""out of their league"" at roughly the same rate? If not, how do you explain how they eventually seem to level off and pair up about the same rate? It's not like the top fifth of men are serial-marrying all of the women.

If dating is nearly impossible for men because women have such high standards, how does it eventually all work out more or less evenly?",I usually don't try to engage these people with the level of logic that you're using. They're not saying these things because they have good evidence or want to actually explain something. They're saying them from a place of deep bitterness and resentment. The facts don't matter. They just want to blame other people for their lack of success in the dating world.

The whole expectation for one party to pay for the date is an outdated sexist concept that leads to problematic outcomes.

- Shows that you're financially responsible adult who can budget and manage their own money.

- Starts things off with open communication between the two parties and leaves assumptions at the door.

- Shows that both parties are enthusiastic about meeting and not going into it with ulterior motives.

I am a Homeowner, a Student doctor, business owner outside of school and generally have alot of hobbies/interests such as skiing, finances/investing, sports, movies, traveling ect.  Im always up to do something interesting and fun, most recently went white water rafting with freinds one weekend and then driving range the other.

I have pretty good success online dating as far as getting matches/dates. After taking a break from dating for 6 months I re-downloaded hinge last month and have about 70 matches. Out of them I have gone on dates with about 10.

I look for someone as an equal to me, as I am looking for something serious. So all have at least college degrees and most have a graduate degree or are working on it (Engineer, Nurse, Doctor ect).

The issue becomes is that I find most of these women dont have many passions/hobbies outside of their careers. When I ever I ask what do you do for fun question I always get the same answer of - Hang with friends, Shop, watch netflix ect. It becomes hard to hold any conversation of substance with them. I feel this has been a common problem with me for the past 2 years or so I have been dating, there really has only ever been 2-3 women that actually were interesting to me.

With this first dates usually become pretty dry and boring. Not sure if I am doing something wrong or maybe I just am not connecting with them?","Sounds like you're just meeting a slew of women you don't connect with.

I know myself for one, if I had a good woman who stood next to me in my battles I would have already been A LOT further in life.

Not to mention my bond and respect for a girlfriend would be even stronger knowing they met and stood by me when I was at the bottom..

Sure some men can do it all alone but not everyone is wired to go it totally alone and succeed

EDIT; To be clear these shouldn't be the people you have to go outta your way or drain all your own resources for but simply being you inspires them to be a better person.

Why would you not want to be such a great partner that women see you as a husband, lifelong partner, and eventual father to her children. Why would you not want to be the person she sees as always there for her, the one she feels safe with?

Could I please get some explanation?","The general sentiment is not that they don‚Äôt want to be the nice man that a woman marries. It‚Äôs that they don‚Äôt wanna be the guy she settles for and marries because she couldn‚Äôt get that from the guys she actually wanted to be with before.

Men want to feel loved, desired, and attracted just as much as women. They also want to be the man a woman has dreamed of being with all her life and not the ‚ÄúI mean I guess I can‚Äôt really do any better‚Äù guy. I definitely want my future wife to be excited at the prospect of dating me."
dating,uaul8r,2022-04-24 13:16:54,I don't like flirting or trying to be friends with girls.,"I don't know I just feel like flirting is a waste of time.

I am very intimate and a hopeless romantic and unless I REALLY like you I just don't feel comfortable/like wasting my time and emotions for a stranger I don't even like that much outside of their looks and that they are a girl. Which also makes it hard to even be friends with girls because I don't like approaching them if they are flooded with vultures and simps of men because I don't want to compete for her attention JUST TO BE A FRIEND.

I feel like this is fucking up my reach to ever finding my soulmate though. But I don't like being fake.

I hate it.

Also OLD sucks ass as many of us agree. Where I live it's hard to find any girl I even might be interested in, and when I am  , they are either swarmed with simps or taken, or well reject me.

I forgot reddit is full of fucking idiots.

THIS IS JUST FOR TALKING TO GIRLS AT ALL. There is always a competitiveness to even trying to be friends with them, and I'm venting that I don't like the fact that I have to basically work harder for a strangers attention , simply because everyone is trying to fuck them. I wish I could just be myself and chill, but no Im not as funny or good looking as the other guys, so I have to put on a show. I hate that.  

&#x200B;",It sounds to me like you want deeper interactions than what you are getting. It seems to me that you feel shallow interactions cause you anxiety and frustration. The problem is for most people need to build trust and affection through the smaller interactions before moving to deeper conversations and connections.

Many women in dating apps would be much more appealing to more guys if they got down to a healthy weight. The truth is that looks are the primary thing most guys are looking for. A lot of exercise isn‚Äôt even required to get a physique most men would prefer; it‚Äôs almost all about calorie intake and diet.

You have your preferences, and that‚Äôs fine! Don‚Äôt let anyone tell you otherwise. They‚Äôre most likely insecure. I use to be like that, and then I saw myself before I lost weight and thought ‚Äúyeah I wouldn‚Äôt fuck my self either lol‚Äù

It seems the only people who are having fun are those guys and the women who want to get pumped and dumped with them or be their ""FWB.""

If I knew him IRL, I would have thought a guy like that would have zero problems and have lots of women want him. Yet here he was also posting on here about how he can't get any matches and all his dating apps are dead.

It seems things have gotten worse than I imagined. I know most women have never wanted brown or yellow men except as friends, but I thought tall fit black guys would still be fashionable enough.

If you‚Äôre enough of both those things, personality doesn‚Äôt much matter.

But in essence yes, of course tall attractive men have a far easier time dating than if you aren‚Äôt those things.

While their frustrations are valid, I would argue that this idea or this mindset that women have it better is simply not true. The reality is that women have as much trouble as men in the dating scene and they complain about it just as much (take this sub for example), but they experience their difficulties in different ways.

Men usually have a difficult time securing a date, and this is what they often complain about. Which when you think about it, makes sense. In dating, women take most of the risk. They are more vulnerable to abuse because they're smaller and weaker. they can get pregnant, and they often get judged more harshly for dating choices. It's a lot to consider and the consequences of making the wrong choice can be scary. Therefore, it is in their best interest to vet again and again and again before going out with guys to minimize the risk. For guys, it's a numbers game. It is in our best interest to ask out as many girls as possible to increase the chances of finding a girl that deems us worthy. However, for many guys, their underwhelming results often leads to self-doubt, insecurity, frustration, and sometimes just giving up.

Women, on the other hand, usually have a difficult time securing a relationship, and this what they complain about. Again, it makes sense if you think about it. Women get flooded with requests for dates online and in real life, and this often leads to choice overload. When faced with too many choices, there will always be this fear that you may have made the wrong decision or that you might've missed on something better. Women in this position often become indecisive, frustrated, and dissatisfied with any of their choices. Another consequence of having too many choices is that it leads women to nitpick and make decisions over arbitrary things. This comes at the cost of vetting properly, which in turn increases the chances of them ending up dating a guy who's less than satisfactory or a guy has the same problem as them where they also have too many choices. This all can be overwhelming to deal with, and some women choose not to deal with it at all.

One could say that men and women have the same issues in dating and meeting people, just on different ends of it. Even though there are as many men as there are women, the dynamics of the dating scene don't make any sense. The current playing field is rigged and everybody loses. I'm not sure what the right solution is, but I think trying to understand the perspective of others helps at least a little.",üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
dating,zfjhte,2022-12-08 00:35:36,Who pays for dates?,"This is perhaps the most commonly asked question every guy has!

Some guys says ‚Äòman always pays‚Äô, some guys say ‚Äòit should be 50-50‚Äô, some guys say higher income earner should pay etc.

In my view, I practise the following:

1. First date gentleman always pays
2. Second date okay to go 50-50 but as a man try to pay the bill. Nothing wrong with footing the bill. 
3. Consistently Dating/Hooking up - Gentleman pays 70% of the time. The woman needs to contribute to the experience too.
4. Marriage/Living together - Go 50/50 on all bills unless the man is the higher income earner.

What do you guys think?","As a guy, I always say at the date that I'm paying unless she has an issue with that. 

Also, I tell her that I like the idea of the guy paying. I also say that if she wants to pay, then we can do something like ""you invite you pay.""

Outside of the first date, I wouldn't ever do a 50/50 thing. Too separated for my taste."

dating,uwlhx0,2022-05-24 07:47:45,Dating as a queer women,"Dating women is fucking shit. I used to date men years ago and it was so much easier. Women are such hard work. I am lucky in a way because I live in london so there should be a lot of queer women to choose from. But I‚Äôve been single for 5 years now. I think part of my problem is I‚Äôm used to dating very good looking girls and all my friends are straight so I‚Äôm never around queer women in my day to day. So this leaves me with apps. 

There is no decent apps for women who just want women, there‚Äôs no such thing as Grindr for girls. If you want to find meaningless sex it‚Äôs so difficult. in your 20s most people I come across are just figuring out they like girls and I‚Äôm often their first sexual experience. Things can get quite emotionally intense quite quickly - I‚Äôve experienced this on my side and the other persons. 

Up until now I‚Äôve kind of dated people consistently for the last 4 years but since February I literally can‚Äôt. Idk what is going on, I can‚Äôt find anyone I want to date. I think I‚Äôm just really over so many years of these apps and Ive got quite picky with who I‚Äôm attracted to. The most recent girl I dated I actually caught feelings for but knew from when I first met her it wasn‚Äôt going to work out. She was toxic and immature and behaved in ways that really hurt me. Buit took me 6 months before I fully cut it off and that‚Äôs because it was the closest thing I have had in so long to love.

It so shit because I feel like I really want to love someone, my life feels very empty at this point. I think for me being around another queer women helps me feel understood where I‚Äôm surrounded by straight people who I feel very different from. I have a lot of different interests to my friends and I‚Äôd say 75% of my nights out and gigs and stuff I go to alone, so i miss having someone to take with me. I‚Äôm also a very sexual person so I‚Äôm struggling with that side of things aswell and engaging in things that aren‚Äôt making me happy- like sleeping with men out of desperation üò≠

I‚Äôm hopeful that I will meet someone at some point but I just look at my future and I see myself getting old and lonely. In someways I‚Äôm so jealous of my straight friends, everywhere we go and everyone we meet is a potential opportunity to meet the right guy. but for me it feels so difficult :(",Idk if you‚Äôre a man or not but as a bi woman I can concur dating men is (not drastically bc men are still men) easier than dating women üò≠
dating,uri1ml,2022-05-17 08:47:20,Why do women seem to go for obnoxious guys?,"So I (33m) had a bad day and decided to go out to a bar. The bar is empty, apart from one pretty bar maid called Angie(26f) I sat down and started ordering drinks and we started talking. We had a really long conversation which honestly meant a lot to me. As I was about to ask for her number in walks in around 6 guys, all early 20s. One half black guy, and 5 white guys with the half black guy the obvious ring leader/‚Äúalpha‚Äù. The main guy marches right up to the bar and asks for a ‚Äúslut juice‚Äù (which I learned is apparently a double vodka with lemonade and lime). They all individually order the same drink and a few of them go off to the pool table and start playing pool. 

The ‚Äúringleader‚Äù stays at the bar talking to angie. He asks her to change the music, and she tells them to use the jukebox. The guy says he doesn‚Äôt wanna pay, and says he knows she has an aux in the back. She says she‚Äôll get in trouble and the guy says ‚Äúnot even for me?‚Äù and to my surprise she goes and puts his phone on the aux in the back. After this they carry on talking and he asks her what her favourite drink is. She tells him sex on the beach and he laughs and tells her that‚Äôs a super ‚Äúbasic‚Äù drink. She tells him that slut juice is much more basic to which he responds ‚Äúyou know you love a good slut‚Äù. I thought this was really crude but she seemed to find it hilarious.

As time goes on the main guy continues to be super obnoxious, telling his friends how trash they are at pool, asking angie to give him ciggarettes (which for some reason she continually does) and stuff like that. Eventually angie asks if he wants to leave a positive review on tripadviser as if he mentions her by name she gets a bonus. He says ‚ÄúI would if you were actually good at your job‚Äù. She feins offense and says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm good at everything I‚Äôll have you know‚Äù. The guy crudely replies ‚ÄúI bet you are‚Äù which gets a bunch of cheers from his lackeys. She laughs and says ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt mean it like that but you‚Äôre not wrong‚Äù. He says ‚Äúwe‚Äôll have to see about that‚Äù and she replies ‚Äúif you‚Äôre lucky‚Äù. At this point I‚Äôm dumbfounded how this sweet, pretty, intelligent young woman is playing into his bullshit.

As time goes on it hits 10:30pm and starts raining, and 3 of the lackeys leave, leaving just the 5 of us in the bar. The ring leader complains about how he doesn‚Äôt want to walk to the club in the rain and asks angie if she would drive him and his friends. She agrees but says she won‚Äôt get out until half 11 unless people leave sooner. The guy turns to me and starts pressuring me to leave and angie just doesn‚Äôt say anything. He starts turning off the speakers and gambling machines and rushing angie to shut the bar and she actually does. He starts barking orders at his lackeys to stack the chairs while angie counts up the till and then she comes from round the bar links arms with the guy, kisses him on the cheek and says ‚Äúthanks for helping me close‚Äù. He asks if she‚Äôs gonna party with them and she says ‚Äúwell I could come for a few drinks‚Äù and they pile into her car and drive off.

As I walk home drunk in the rain I just feel rage and then despair. Why do women go for guys like that? Crude, obnoxious, assholes with huge egos? Me and her had a deep meaningful conversation and then in walks in some typical ‚Äúalpha male‚Äù and I become invisible. What is it about guys like that that makes seemingly smart, nice women go crazy?","If this story is real, these two people clearly already know each other. Nothing about this reads like a first interaction. You assuming that a bartender who‚Äôs nice and talks to you ‚Äî literally her job ‚Äî must be into you, and the way you talk about her as a ‚Äúseemingly smart, nice woman‚Äù who‚Äôs tricked by her dumb woman brain into preferring an ‚Äúalpha male‚Äù and ‚Äúring leader‚Äù that you repeatedly note is ‚Äúhalf black,‚Äù is just red flag central. You seem to be mad at this guy just because some girl liked talking to him more than she liked talking to you. And it sounds like when she started interacting with him, and no longer just totally focusing on you, you started getting drunker and seething with rage. I wouldn‚Äôt pick you either."

dating,rhtltn,2021-12-16 15:55:37,Why it is racist to ‚Äúprefer to date only someone of your race‚Äù,"I keep seeing these threads having the crap upvoted out of them because the internet loves an excuse for racism, so just for fun and because why not, here are 10 reasons ‚Äúpreferring to date someone only of your race‚Äù is racist. (This is from my experience) (as an ambiguously brown person) 

1. Because you said it. You stood there in a group of people, when nobody on earth asked you, and said ‚ÄúI only date WHITE GIRLS‚Äù and then stared me down. Hey you know what? I didn‚Äôt ask you out. I have no interest. But the fact that you turned this into an exclusion party is racist. 

2. Because you don‚Äôt even know what ‚Äúyour race‚Äù is. ‚ÄúI only date Asian girls‚Äù Your name is Johnny and you‚Äôre an American from Jersey. Stop. 

3. Because you‚Äôre describing features, not race or culture. You like Asian girls? My friend Chandrika from India is single. Oh, not THAT kind of Asian? You like African girls? How cool, this is Starsha, from Egypt! Oh, not THAT kind of African. 

4. You have no understanding of the race or culture you ‚Äúprefer‚Äù. Thanks for the offer to date me because we both love weed and Cardi B, and thanks so much for asking if I actually love any of those things instead of assuming, based on skin tone. 

5. You sexualize a race, and lump someone in with it. No, I do not know any of the positions of the Kamasutra. No, I am not asking to marry you. No, I did not take off my hijab and sully my family‚Äôs honour. 

6. You‚Äôll make an exception for sex‚Ä¶but you won‚Äôt bring me home. YOU‚ÄôRE not racist, it‚Äôs your parents. You would totally want a long term relationship if THEY weren‚Äôt forcing you to date someone from your small island nation of 8,000 people‚Ä¶.and find her in Canada. 

7. You will date outside of your race, but you will use this leverage to make racist jokes and comments, put down and disparage your partner‚Ä¶or worse, your kids. ‚ÄúMy kid has ADHD because she‚Äôs black‚Äù -authentic quote. Or their features ‚Äúomgeee I just don‚Äôt know what to do with her hayyyyaaarrr‚Äù 

8. You‚Äôll break up with people who have the right features if they turn out not to be the ‚Äúright race‚Äù. ‚ÄúI found out she was actually Portuguese and I just couldn‚Äôt be with her after that‚Äù ‚ÄúHe spoke Japanese but he was actually Chinese‚Äù 

9. You think I‚Äôm beautiful but ‚Äúit‚Äôs like looking at a pretty alien.‚Äù -direct quote

10. You and your friends build up the confidence and perceived worth of a specific race of people regardless of their actual looks. You stand around in a crowd screaming that any guy who dated me would be an outcast and a loser. That impacts who others choose to date and anyone who does date me is socially ostracized until he properly dates a white girl. You post entire threads online about it and call it a racial preference. 

TL;DR if you had an actual preference, you wouldn‚Äôt have to announce it and police others with it.

Edit: I will not respond to people who clearly didn‚Äôt read a word I wrote but super want to be racist.",Personal Prefernace is not a act of racism
dating,oukz4o,2021-07-30 13:50:27,Why are girls so picky with who they date?,"Guys need to be at least 6ft tall, 6 inches, 6 figure salary, 6 pack abs, good face while girls just need to be at a healthy weight and lots of guys will line up to date her.","Because it's easier for men to say that women are too picky, than to actually work on themselves and make themselves worth dating for a woman.

It's not about the six-pack, it's about being able take care of yourself so she doesn't have to be your mom while dating you. 
It's not about the 6 figure salary, it's about ambition and going somewhere in life, so she doesn't have to be your provider when dating you. 
It's not about the good face, but having the confidence to rock the face you have.

dating,12xvesd,2023-04-24 20:33:12,"As a man who will be entering his 30's very soon, is it wrong of me to go for younger, more attractive girls in their early to mid 20's?","So I will be 30 in a few months, and honestly I have not really dated much throughout my 20's. I have been focused mainly on myself, working on my career, fitness, hobbies, etc. I am getting to a point in my life where I feel like mentally I am able to handle all of my own responsibilities rather easily, so I am wanting to get out there and take dating more seriously.

Ultimately I would like to get married and have a family one day. Also, since I have taken good care of my health, fitness, and finances, I am definitely currently the most attractive I have ever been in my life (much more attractive than when I was in my early 20's).

So just thinking about this logically, why wouldn't I try to date women you are younger, and to put it bluntly, more attractive? Especially since I want kids one day, so dating someone my age would mean that we would only have a few short years before she starts approaching her 40's and the risk of birth complications starts going up.

People always give me this same dating advice BULLSHIT of ""get your shit together, and then you'll find someone"". That's a huge pile of crap for a number of reasons.

In my case, it's getting my degree. Well, then what? I'll be working on my master's, and then people will give me the advice of, ""work on yourself, wait until you're done with your master's degree, then you can settle down"". Then what? Then ""working on myself"" will consist of saving up enough money for a house. Once I do that and have more free time, people will tell me to work on my hobbies and get some new interests. Then, it will be to get the next promotion at work. Then, it will be some other arbitrary thing.

There is NO POINT at which someone ""has their shit together"". My late best friend was a CPK host with aspirations to be a forklift operator, and he was with the love of his life. On the other hand, ELON MUSK, who ""has his shit together"" and has ""worked on himself"", has had a lot of trouble when it comes to women.

We should honestly create a new rule in r/dating banning members from giving this advice.

I just told my buddy who has problem with women to ""work on himself"" but I didn't say go save money, buy a better car, get fancier clothes. I told him to work on basic communication skills, be more open minded, try new experiences, and talk to everyone so you can LEARN.

dating,ymetj9,2022-11-05 00:11:49,I finally decided I‚Äôm interested in him and now he‚Äôs acting dry,"I (F24) have known this guy (M26) since college. I‚Äôve never really thought much of him tbh, I was even in a brief relationship with one of his friends back in the day. He didn‚Äôt really start showing interest in me until a couple of years ago. He would DM me a lot, asked me out on a couple of dates, and I just didn‚Äôt really reciprocate the energy. I don‚Äôt know what happened, but recently I changed my mind about him and we‚Äôve been talking pretty much every single day for the past few weeks. I was still a bit unsure, but I‚Äôve decided over the past couple of days that I really do like him. Of course, now that I‚Äôve come to that conclusion, he‚Äôs been so distant. He doesn‚Äôt message me first and when I do message him, he replies with one word answers. I just find it so strange that he‚Äôs spent 2 years relentlessly pursuing me and now that I‚Äôm into it he‚Äôs pulled back. What do you think this means? What should I do?

Edit because everyone is making the assumption that I only started pursuing him after he stopped pursuing me: 
The timing simply wasn‚Äôt right when he was pursuing me at the start. I had just gotten out of a relationship. Even so, I kept a platonic relationship with him. Everyone here seems to think I only became interested once he stopped pursuing me. This is not the case. We were both actively pursuing each other, and he only started growing distant after a few weeks of us non-stop communicating. It‚Äôs clear to me that the general consensus is that he‚Äôs no longer interested, I just didn‚Äôt expect so many people would be angry that I didn‚Äôt try to force something that wasn‚Äôt there in the beginning.

dating,ntzauf,2021-06-07 00:06:38,"As a man, men need to learn to date in their league, not complain so much, and not take stuff personally","I'm saying all of this as a guy whose dating life has improved extraordinarily in the past year and who feels like I'm finally understanding dating a lot more. And wish that someone had given me this advice at a time when I was feeling much more insecure and self-loathing when I should have been a lot more easy on myself and a lot less naively optimistic about dating.

The reality is as a guy, if you are not handsome, tall, socially confident and a healthy weight (and I mean all four), dating is TOUGH. If you're tall and decent-looking, but painfully shy and awkward, it's tough. If you're outgoing and funny, but a bit on the short side or pudgy, it's tough. And if you lack all four, it's even tougher. And don't give me examples of some short or overweight or shy guy who ""kills it"" with the ladies-we're either talking about someone who's famous or rich, dating someone they've known for ages, or a considerable anomaly. Guys make it a lot harder on themselves when they don't accept LEAGUES EXIST. Leagues exist and they are about looks, weight, height, and charisma and nothing else. It is not about how smart you are or how funny you are or how good a person you are. That shit is valuable if you want be a good friend or successful comedian or get into Harvard. But it's not relevant to dating. Hell, it's relevant once you're actually in a relationship or marriage, but to the game of dating we're all subjected, nah.

What guys do is pretend leagues don't exist, or I don't ""belive in leagues"", or whatever, and then throw a tantrum when they get rejected by every one they make a move on. The same way class and institutional racism exists, that whether you like it nor it's easier for a white person or a man to get a top salaried job than a black person or a woman, your looks and confidence define where you're at in terms of dating and you've gotta be realistic.

The problem is, men take accepting their league as being somehow a way of saying they're ugly or they're not popular, etc. That if they decide to not hit on every 9 and 10 they see on Tinder they must not be worth dating.

The reality is: no! You, dude, are 100% a catch for someone, but you're a catch for someone in your league. And I'll hear guys moan, but I have handsome face or I'm tall or I'm funny, etc. But are you tall, handsome, skinny, and confident, and all four? If not, then dude, you're not an 8-10, you're a 5-7. And as a guy, if you're a 5-7, you're not going to realistically do better than that in the girl department. Why should a girl have to put up with something you're not willing to accept in the opposite sex? Too many guys are passing up totally adorable, cute girls who are not the perfect weight or have the perfect face cause of entitlement.

And what I'll say, as someone who has dated outside of my league in the past, it's overrated as hell. You spend all the time feeling totally uncomfortable cause you're aware of the situation and know that person could be dating someone who's more of a hottie. Normal looking girls are just as sexy and fun in bed and romantic as the super hot girls, and they tend to be a lot more down to earth. Once you accept that leagues are real, you stop taking your lack of success personally and start realizing the game...that yeah, I am a catch, but not by these stupid social measurements. And then you start dating people in your league and suddenly you have people just as interested in you as you are into them.

Losing weight and going for girls in my league exclusively is the smartest thing I've ever done. I'm not saying dating becomes easy. Being single can be hard enough because of not having someone to have a loving relationship or sex with. There's no reason to throw insecurity into the mix and take it personally. The 80-90% of guys who find dating nowadays tough need to realize it's not them, it's just the reality for the other 80-90%. And that they'll eventually find someone if they're persistent, take care of their appearance/weight, get the best possible pics for their dating app profiles, and stick to their league. There's def a girl who wants to date you. It just might not be the one who you're making a tantrum about.

It's not about convicing yourself you're a higher league than you are-it's about liking yourself and your appearance at the league you are. Instead of being a 5 or a 7 and convcing yourself you're a 9 and no one knows it (least of all women), be the hottest, most confident 5 or 7 you can be.

My main point is you want someone as into you as you are into them, not just the hottest person you can find, and you're deluding yourself if you don't accept the primacy of looks in this. ","The concept of someone wanting to be with you is, indeed, personal. And if literally, NO ONE in the world wants you, you would be hurt as well . You can't deny that."

I swear to God some of the rudest women i've ever met are below 5'2. Some women in this range have such a nasty attitude and they piss me off. I'm 5'4 and women in this range tell me they don't want to be with me because they don't want to ruin their kids lives if they end up being short, as if being short is like some kind of disease. They also say that short guys aren't manly and we end up automatically having some napoleon complex, really? Like its as if a short guy they encounter is automatically seen as insecure and have some kind of complex. A lot of these women also make this dumb argument that we seem to be entitled to short women or act as if they belong to us, but they don't realize that they're usually the ones that are a good amount shorter than a lot of us without realize the shit that we go through while playing it out as if we're acting ""entitled.""",closer to hell

I have been seeing a third year med student for a month now. He was upfront about his busy rotation in hospital on weekdays and could only see me on weekends. The first three dates were fantastic-great chemistry, we made out and he said he wanted to see if 'us' can be a thing (relationship-wise). He also told me he would like to take intimacy slowly so that we don't kill the spark. However, the last two weeks he has cancelled the dates on Sunday night twice. First time, he said he double-booked and needed to reschedule the date. This time, he told me he was not feeling well the whole week, did't work at the hospital, and will have to postpone it to next Sunday. Although both times he offered a time to meet up again, I got a bit annoyed and texted him that I rather him to be honest and not wasting my time. He texted back and said he's keen to see me and he doesn't like to play stupid games...the reason why I have been suspicious is because we met on a dating app and a few day","It‚Äôs been a month.

So today my house‚Äôs water was shut off, and told my bf at 5pm and he said he could offer me shower. However, I had some vision appointments with my colleague after work so I didn‚Äôt check my phone, and after I finished vision check and dinner with my colleague, it was already 8:30pm.
Then I called my bf, he said he was about to shower so we hanged up.
At 9:10pm when I got home, there‚Äôs still no water at home. So I asked him if I can go to his place and stay over. He said no because he normally goes to sleep at 10pm.
I was upset because all I asked was one easy help only for one really inconvenient night, but he said no because he couldn‚Äôt delay one hour sleep for just one day.
But his point was he offered me about shower and stuff awhile ago, and I didn‚Äôt respond. When I called him for help, it was already late for him as he needs to go to sleep at 10pm.

Am I asking too much? Whose fault is it? What do you guys think?





Edit:
Thanks guys for all of your response and opinions üôèüèº. Really appreciate it!

Some more context: 
1) I planned my vision appointment with my colleague (also my manager) last week, so I thought I shouldn‚Äôt dropped the appointment because of today‚Äôs water off accident. I checked my phone once during the dinner but my colleague was talking to me, so I thought I‚Äôd reply back to my bf later.
2) I got the water shut off notice around 3pm, I texted my bf around 5pm. I wasn‚Äôt sure if I should go to his place as I wasn‚Äôt sure if the water would come back, so I didn‚Äôt make plans with him in advance.  After I got home 9:10pm, I realized I still didn‚Äôt have water at home, so I tried to call him asap to see if he could help.
3) It was not just about the shower, I told him no water on toilets, sinks, etc‚Ä¶ so I couldn‚Äôt use toilet or wash my face/hands or brush my teeth. He said the water shall be back in the morning and refused me.
4) After seeing you guys‚Äô comments, I realized I should have made plans in advance and not wait till the last minute, as he might not always be available for me.  But I am upset bc after realizing how inconvenient I am tonight, why couldn‚Äôt he just compromise for 1 night? Like it‚Äôs just 1 hour later‚Äôs sleep‚Ä¶ 
5) thanks for y‚Äôall‚Äôs  opinions, made me realize part of my bad as well","I'm not necessarily seeing the argument here, so I can't assume who is at fault. He offered to have you over earlier in the day, you didn't have a chance to respond until it was much later. When you were responding it was already too late on his schedule.

dating,hj88i1,2020-07-01 11:13:09,How to hack online dating process. For men.,"I know that the online dating scene is ridiculously biased.  Women get a flood of messages and guys don't get enough messages, or spend ages just texting without meeting up. I get it, that its a pain also for the women to wade through 100s if not 1000s of messages.

I am someone who does a lot better in person so I am keen to meet someone face to face as soon as possible. Once the initial meeting has happened then by all means maintain contact via messages.

However the challenge is to not spend soo much time online.  So, I have decided to outsource this part of the process.  I have hired a female assistant, given her my login details and all she has to do is to text message and maintain contact with the women that I say I like. The aim being to get them comfortable enough to want to meet up in person.  In some cases the women may want a phone conversation before hand. That would also be fine. They arrange the call and I take the call.

Lets see how this works out for me.

Now I know that the women here are going to absolutely hate this.  They will feel  this I am leading the women on and that they are perhaps being reverse catfished, if there is such a thing.

Sorry ladies but the odds are just so stacked against us men (and you also have a difficult job to sift through all the flood of messages). All I am doing is trying to even out the odds in my favour a bit.

This is just about getting the face to face dates, nothing more than that. It is still up to me in person to develop chemistry with the people I meet.",Incoming AITA post about hiring a woman to message his gf when they first met online.

I‚Äôd really appreciate the help as I am starting to be afraid of men and dating in general.

I (25F) have come to a realization that all of my life, I have always picked older men who seem kind and have everything together, but only to find out they are horrible people. 

I‚Äôm pretty independent and financially stable myself, but I also want a man who I know will have my back, who‚Äôs considerate, and can take care/protect me if life decides to beat me to a pulp one day. It‚Äôs not really much to ask right? 

Welp‚Ä¶. from dating a 30 year old man who I basically had to mother at the age of 21. A man who I had the horror of finding out that he didn‚Äôt wash his bedsheets for 3 years until he met me, who I had to ask him if he would pay half of the Plan B that I, as a broke college student at the time, couldn‚Äôt afford. Not to mention he made me venmo him back the bag of chips that I got at the store that he paid for bc I forgot my wallet. He made roughly 75k/yr at the time and lives at home with his parents, can‚Äôt the man just let me have my bag of Cheetos? My goodness

Anywho, from that 30 yr old man-child, I moved on to a 29 yr old who came off as kind and caring for the first couple months, I mean the man washes his bedsheets alright, and you might think it‚Äôs funny bc it‚Äôs the bare minimum, but please try to understand that it is incredibly hard nowadays to find men with those bare minimums. With this man, I really thought I met the one, only to find out that he is a complete narc. He conceal-carries  everywhere we go (Costco, the gym, his mom‚Äôs, and on all of our dates), would get mad that I don‚Äôt give him enough of my time  or attention. No matter what I do to appease him, it is never enough. But what really got me was when he told me he wanted to take me to LA for Valentine‚Äôs Day, only to come back home and sent me a spreadsheet of all the expenses, asking for half, which is perfectly fine with me, but the cherry on top was when I saw that he charged me $2.50 for a water bottle that I thought he bought for me out of care. There‚Äôs more to this but I don‚Äôt need to go further more into detail for you to get the kind of man he is. 

Please be nice as I don‚Äôt date a lot and really struggle with filtering out these toxic men. They are everywhere. I don‚Äôt hate men as my dad and grandpa are wonderful husbands to their wives. I know there are great men out there, but how do I know if they are genuinely good and not putting up a fake nice guy facade?","I'm an old guy. I hope you don't mind me chiming in?

Can we talk about how liberating modern dating is? Can we talk about how online dating has helped widen our options? About how it helps us explore and find ourselves, our preferences, without any societal pressure whatsoever.

For example, if there was no online dating, I would have been stuck with my tiny social circle. Would have been around the same 10-12 people all my life. For someone who's always busy with work, this is an absolute game changer. I have made connections with people from all walks of life, be it sexual, romantic or platonic. I've had experiences, some mediocre some life changing, which my introverted self of 5 years ago would have never dreamt of. My personality has also grown by leaps and bounds on account of those experiences.

It seems to me most of people's complains about modern dating comes from being unclear about their intentions, expectations, and boundaries. Treating every date on its own, thinking of it as an opportunity to meet people you wouldn't usually meet in real life, is far more rewarding; than going into it expecting to meet the love of your life.

dating,vkh04w,2022-06-25 15:06:49,Just a quick PSA since I see so many angry threads: HAVE ZERO EXPECTATIONS OF PEOPLE....,"No matter what stage of ""dating"" you're at. Quite literally, you could be in a relationship, a MARRIAGE, hooking up, just matched on the app, talking for a day, talking for a week, an hour a year: ALWAYS assume that person could fall out of love and interest for you. At any stage of your interaction with them.

The reason so many people have so much pain is because so many of us have not caught up to the reality of the fickle age we live in now, of social media, dating apps etc. If you make peace with the fact that you could wake up tomorrow after having had amazing sex with someone, an amazing time, been promised a relationship, or promised a date, a girl who had enthusiasm for you but then ghosted etc, you will literally never have to make another Reddit thread complaining about these assorted issues that ultimately communicate the same message ""LEAVE ME ALONE I'M NOT INTERESTED IN BEING WITH YOU IN ANY CAPACITY"".

TLDR: Just block and delete numbers, matches, people who don't reciprocate interest. Treat them like randoms on the street you never met and would never spend time with or get to meet and just keep searching for someone who will show you a lot of enthusiasm. You will have a MUCH easier time with dating this way. No expectation, no disappointment.","I am sorry, but when I am married to a person, I do not assume every day they‚Äôll fall out of love with me. How tiresome is that? Yea, people can be assholes and/or change their mind. And that might hurt and that‚Äôs okay. Instead of focusing on being as emotional detached as possible, I‚Äôd suggest focusing on yourself and know that you will be okay even if someone leaves you. If you know you‚Äôll be fine either way, you‚Äôll date way more relaxed and more confident. But always ‚Äúkeeping in mind‚Äù that someone will leave you sounds like anxiety speaking. 


Romantic relationships are not necessary for a happy life. However, there‚Äôs nothing wrong with serious dating and also expecting some decency from people."

But when you go on one date or 2 dates with someone and then your crying about being ghosted, you should realize that's just the norm in 2019 and most people who have healthy dating lives are not that devestated when they get ghosted because they don't invest all their emotional energy in one person.

Average to above-average looking ladies claiming how hard it is to get guys to show interest in them on a dating app, put up or shut up. I can put up.

Just on OkCupid alone, since April, I have over 5,000 Likes. FIVE THOUSAND! I‚Äôm average to better-than-average in looks. A friend I trust says that with makeup, hair, outfit, etc. I‚Äôm a 7.

Many of the guys showing interest are on a higher attractiveness level than I am.

You have to pay money to see the numbers and I stopped my subscription awhile ago, but if someone wants to see a screenshot for proof of this, PayPal me $33CDN to re-subscribe and I‚Äôll take screenshots of my OkCupid numbers for you.

I‚Äôm not saying all, most, half, or even *quite some* are men I‚Äôd be interested in dating. I‚Äôm not saying I have 5,000+ ‚Äúquality‚Äù men to choose from. (By ‚Äúquality‚Äù, I mean gamer nerd dudes who keep clean and relatively fashionable. I want a gamer nerd dude, not a neckbeard. Not every gamer nerd dude is or *has to be* a neckbeard. You *absolutely* can be a nice looking gamer nerd dude.)

I‚Äôm *also* not saying that *anyone*, men *or* women, has to date *every person who clicks Like on them*. Shove your strawmen arguments up your chocolate whizzway.

Just *don‚Äôt for a minute* let some average to above-average woman *anywhere* tell you it‚Äôs hard for her to get attention on dating apps. 5,000+ Likes since April prove otherwise. What she *should* say is it‚Äôs hard to get attention from the *types of men she‚Äôs most interested in*. *That‚Äôs* a perfectly fine, fair, and realistic complaint.

I‚Äôm not saying any woman deserves or *doesn‚Äôt* deserve whatever attention she *wants*. You deserve whatever you‚Äôre truly worth and there‚Äôs no way I would know that nor do I *claim* to know that.

I just got sick of this bullshit myth that ‚Äúgirls have a hard time dating‚Äù. No, they have a hard time dating *guys they want*.

And because I know people would wonder, most of the guys I swiped right on either became uninterested in me because I‚Äôm too much of a dork and I‚Äôm too affectionate out-of-the-gate, which is *totally fair*, they can like what they want, they don‚Äôt owe me *anything*. Or they were Nigerian scammers. I have proof of that *too* for those who think I‚Äôm lying.

No, I won‚Äôt give out my personal identifying info on here or my pictures for judgment. I don‚Äôt owe anyone here that.

Want more of my dating anecdotes? You can DM me and I‚Äôll see what I‚Äôm interested in talking about.

But there you go. Myth *busted*. :P

Edited to add because I‚Äôm sure the Female Dating Strategy people will screencap this post to post in their subreddit and try to mock it:

I am not saying any woman must date *any and every man that clicks Like on her*. Having *any* kind of standards you want is *fine*. It‚Äôs *your* life and you shouldn‚Äôt be forced to date *anyone* you don‚Äôt want. Your standards are *yours* to choose and fight for. You don‚Äôt owe *anyone* your time and effort. You don‚Äôt owe *anyone* a date for *any reason*. I‚Äôm not saying *anything different* in this post.

One more edit: If you try to argue with me on something I covered in my post in a way that shows you *deliberately misread* it, I‚Äôm going to assume you‚Äôve built a strawman argument to fight and I won‚Äôt engage with you on it. If I don‚Äôt reply to you, I‚Äôm not a coward. Your argument is just bullshit.","its what I say all the time. women get likes but I think guys are reaching wherever they can and with whomever they can.  and women have a lot more work and a lot more filtering to do.  

getting attention is worth what at the end of the day for you? does that do much for you? because if getting messages by women I would not date and are unattractive as satisfying, I think it does the opposite to me. it brings me down that I get messages from the ones I would not date. 

figure the vast majority of guys grenade bomb every women and then see what floats.  and many men are looking for sex or married etc. how much is all that attention worth when the guys you want arent interested long term. quantity of quality. 

5000+ with few quality options. the number 5000 is impressive, but filtering and calculating the bottom line, it isnt. basically a lot of fluff and nothing much to show for at the end. id rather be in my place and have more relevent matches than a lot of no. its a lot of work to go through all that ""no""

the only reason it ""seems"" impressive that women have options, is because men pursue. more so that online dating has a dense amount of guys all together. but the same guy is messaging every other women they can. they have nothing to lose. but if you take away the fact that guys are pursuers, it would not be impressive. I know from many women, they shake their head when I tell them to entertain me with OLD stories. they dont want to even talk. and here I am talking to 6 lovely ladies feeling like a king!"
dating,k1k34e,2020-11-26 18:03:32,Why men should message first in online dating,"Alright, so i'm just going to come out and say it: You guys should message first. However, the reason isn't because of traditional gender roles, but rather due to numbers and in improving your chances. I'm not sure what the average number of matches y'all get in a day is, but from what I've read, it seems like very little. 

Now, as you get a couple matches a day, the girls you're matching with likely get a dozen or more. I'm going to tell you this now, anyone who is currently working full time or living their life does not have the time to go message a dozen men in a day, and then maintain conversation with them all. What that means is we generally select a  couple of people who stand out among those dozen. How does that happen? They're the ones who messaged us.

I have been on tinder for a couple months now and  have over 200 matches. I have been watching and monitoring the percentage of matches who actually message first. I've come to find it is around 25%. When it comes to online, people really don't stand out enough just through pictures or bios, especially when everyone's profiles are the same regurgitated things. What im saying is that your best way of standing out is still through messaging. It is highly unlikely a girl is going to look at your profile alone and decide to message you out of a dozen. Why? Because online, everyone you've matched with also looks pretty damn equal due to them all having something you liked.

I'm not saying this is fair and I do wish it was much more balanced in online dating. I too have messaged men i was really interested in to just get no reply. I know it's really discouraging. However, it is about numbers and your best bet is still messaging first. Even if you don't get a reply, your chances are even lower through waiting for women to message first.","men cant really do that on bumble, so yeah you will have to message first. hate the women whose profile says ""message to find out more"". umm sorry i can't"

When she wants to talk to you she‚Äôll make eye contact, she‚Äôll be open, she‚Äôll react as if she‚Äôs talking to someone and wants to continue the conversation.

If she‚Äôs closed off, turned away, is looking away from you, she probably doesn‚Äôt want to talk to you and is creeped out.

> If you have to schedule the date or meet up more than twice, she‚Äôs not really interested.

If she wants to go on a date with you, she will. If she‚Äôs busy constantly and makes no effort to find a date she can see you, she doesn‚Äôt want you. Stop touching back with her to see when she wants to see you. I give her, 2 calendar dates. If she‚Äôs busy both and she doesn‚Äôt say when she‚Äôs free, I‚Äôm out.

> If she doesn‚Äôt at least offer to pay she‚Äôs using you for a free meal.

It‚Äôs expected for you as a guy to pay, but to make herself look good a woman that wants you to like her will fake offer to pay for her half. 

If she doesn‚Äôt, she doesn‚Äôt care what you think of her because she doesn‚Äôt like you. Move on.

> If you haven‚Äôt been physical by the fourth date, she‚Äôs not attracted to you sexually.

If by the fourth date you haven‚Äôt even made it to 2nd base she isn‚Äôt into you sexually. She might think you‚Äôre a good guy and is waiting for the sexual chemistry, but you‚Äôre not giving her sexual urges. It‚Äôs okay, this isn‚Äôt a deal breaker if you‚Äôre finej with waiting, but just be aware.

> Lastly, mind her texting/calling habits. 

A game I like to play is that if I notice I‚Äôm starting all the conversations, I‚Äôll stop. No messages, no calls, no anything. If after 48 hours I don‚Äôt receive a text or call from her, I drop her. She‚Äôs obviously not as interested in me if I am the one initiating the conversations.",[deleted]

Yes I could've been nicer about it I was upset, after 2 amazing dates things seemed to be going great but then a I got for 2 amazing dates i was friendzoned but whatever look forward never back!

Next up.","Dude it's just 2 dates, she doesn't have to like you. Sometimes you realise there's just not the necessary spark and that's ok. 

Also, stop calling it the ""friendzone"". She realised she liked you as a person but no more, and thus wanted to be friends, and instead you were rude and disrespectful towards her. Take some time before you do something to imagine how it might make her feel.

It sounds like you did an incredibly cruel and hurtful thing kicking her out of your car, and to be honest she dodged a bullet.

Modern dating is hard sometimes. Often you end up going on dates with people you barely know. You are just trying it out before you've even had a chance to develop a crush, and there's this all-or-nothing expectation to either date or never speak again. Sometimes you realise you like someone just not in *that* way, and it would be nice to gain a friendship from it instead.

You say ""next up"" like it's a challenge, but I really hope you start treating the next woman as a human being with feelings and emotions as opposed to just some sex object who's nothing to you as soon as she rejects you."

dating,12qlly8,2023-04-18 12:35:31,I don't want a woman to ask me on the first date,"\[Not really venting, I just needed to put some kind of flair\]

No shade or disrespect to my fellow men who would love for a woman to initiate the first meet-up, but it's just not for me.

To clarify, I have **zero problem** with a woman who's interested taking initiative in planning or suggesting **a second date** or anything beyond. For the first one, though, I believe that I should be the one doing the heavy lifting. Yes, there's usually the initial nervousness surrounding whether or not she'll say yes, but to me, that's a drop in the bucket compared to the long-term payoff that comes when she (or someone else if the first woman says she's not interested) says yes and you get to really make a good impression with planning and carrying out the first date. In my opinion, that shows a lot of initiative and it shows that you're a considerate man who knows what he wants. I personally wouldn't want a woman to ask me on the first date because I wouldn't want someone that I am interested in to think that I wasn't interested enough to do some work to get the ball rolling.

Now, obviously, some men will vehemently disagree and say that dating should be mutual from the get-go and we can toss our gender assumptions from the start. I have no argument there, I'm just sharing how I prefer things to be. I wouldn't want to plan *every* date because I do believe that some mutuality is necessary, but for the first one, I like to take care of it.

Edit: It's just a preference lol no need to get all bent out of shape","People who say shit like this are needy and insecure. Go with the flow, don't try to control thinga. If you meet an amazing woman who asks you out on an amazing date would you be like ew? No"

It made me question why, like are they jealous of younger women snatching guys and perhaps that's it, but that is just a guess?  I got into the relationship with her, because I am in love with her and think she is really great.  I didn't do it as a 'contest to my women friends my age' or anything of that sort.

My prev GF was an Analyst in big IT company, so I felt comfortable with her and that she is also looking for ways to achieve success in life. Now I am single, and people I am seeing from OD Apps like tinder seem to be unambitious, staying in one work for too long, having jobs with limited ceiling in terms of growth.

 Recent example is a private tutor for music, she seems like an amazing person all around, but I just don't feel like long term there is compatibility if she has no ambitions, I might lose respect for her because of that.

And furthermore, I now understand why women my age have frustratingly high standards. They don't have as much time. So they've got to find the perfect man, and right away. I understand and sympathize with that.

&#x200B;

But the consequences of the age advantage are deeper then that. Even when Im 35, Ill still be competing for the same 23-27 year olds. Im in the game for the long haul. The worlds gonna keep on turning.

If you're a single man, don't sweat the process. As long as you're remotely fuckable, you've got 40 years to find the right woman.","Oh... No you don't 

Your hair starts falling out, you get a beer gut and your sperm count goes down. ED will become common in a few years for you and no woman will want to have you children as you get past 35 because it's been discovered that old sperm is responsible for birth defects in babies.

Plus most women don't want to be changing the diapers of their spouse when he turns 70 while they are 60. Then he dies at 75 and she will be single for 20 years of her last remaining days. Women do not want a piece of that at all and no longer date with huge age gaps unless they are looking for money and are hoping you die soon and just put you in a home"

Do you think that is the new normal?

Ie. Many women find dating normal men so unappealing if you're normal looking you should pay women to date you?","Well, I know most women here in 2021 are focused more on who they are as an individual rather than focusing on relationships.

The thing I hate most about it is, I have to spend so much time trying to come up with a funny opening line, because an average/above average line will never get a response. But that line can be wasted on someone who never opens the app, or just there for insta followers, or have no intention of meeting up overall, or just bored and want to talk to random strangers....

Men are literally falling flat on their face to worship women at every turn.  An attractive girl can post a pic on social media and immediately rack up hundreds of likes and comments.

Girls are so inundated with advances that they will instinctively brush off even men they are attracted to. Guys are forced to develop ‚Äúgame‚Äù and spend endless hours on self improvement and trying to ‚Äústand out‚Äù whereas most women can just basically show up and get laid whenever they want. 

You can also see how desperate men are to win the favor of women in the rampant simping and white knighting taking place on social media. It‚Äôs really pathetic and has basically ruined dating.","Men don't need women more, they just WANT them more in the cases you're talking about. Men are desperate for companionship in an age where they're living isolated and without emotional support. 

Men can be perfectly happy without women if they build themselves a strong personal life and surround themselves with a good family/friend group, but they don't want to and instead think a woman will magically solve all of their issues for them. 

Women, on the other hand, are being bombarded by some of those men that see them as a mend all and they don't want anything to do with those men. And, with men thinking throwing money at some girl on a screen will somehow make the girl love them, you can't really blame those women for monetizing it.

dating,pabdhr,2021-08-23 23:22:21,why have ugly guy-pretty/average girl couples vanished from the face of the earth?,"You've probably heard the statement a couple of times, of how ""even ugly guys can have beautiful girlfriends"". And indeed, back in the early 2000's, i could see quite a few, the occassional ugly guy with a drop dead gorgeous girl and some really average 6/10 guys with some pretty girls. It didn't happen in my own friend circle but it did happen outside of it. This also happened with some frequency in the celebrity world, with some beautiful female celebrities dating ""ugly"" male actors.

However, I notice that this phenomenon seems to have dissappeared for quite some time. Even years before the covid 19 lockdowns, I had noticed that the number of ugly guys dating pretty girls or even just any girls in general have dropped drastically, to the point where i wouldn't be able to find even one when walking down the street. Even in the celebrity world, this trend was apparent. I follow quite a few millenial actresses who play these coming of age comedies where they date nerds in the movie and stuff but was quite dissapointed when i found out their boyfriends in real life were all 100% handsome male models and not the geeky guys i shipped for on TV. From time to time, I also run into couples on my facebook update feed and not one did i see a girl dating an ugly guy. Instead, i see the opposite now, there are many ""ugly"" girls with drop dead gorgeous guys but none the other way around. the only couples i see that fit the bill of an average guy/pretty girl are those who are already in their late 30's or 40's today, never under 30. and even that is rare.

what changed?",Dating apps made those girls realize they can find better looking guys and made those guys realize they can find no one.

In my opinion, you‚Äôre just wasting the other person‚Äôs time. I think our society doesn‚Äôt value dating with intent anymore. The endgame of (serious) relationships is always marriage. If you want to pump and dump men/women, you‚Äôll never get anything emotionally gratifying in the long run. If you want to live that lifestyle, you should frequent women who work in fashion, entertainment, or modelling. In my experience, the average 24 year old professional class woman/men doesn‚Äôt want to be ‚Äúsugardadied ‚Äú by some gallivanting bachelor in their 30s. Trying to be Leonardo DiCaprio or some dude who takes their relationships casually ain‚Äôt going to lead to success for the average person.","Disagree.

If you need a bit of paper and some metal which may or may not have a gem or two for the relationship to work then it's only going to end in divorce because, ultimately, it doesn't change anything. Once the novelty wears off, you're in the same place you were before with less money, a ring and a bit of paper.

You're looking at this as if your choice is either pump and dump or get married. A serious relationship can be two people together without getting married. Many probably choose not to because of the expectation that society places on people to have these big fancy weddings, which, of course, can be very costly.

The end game of a serious relationship is having someone you love for life. You don't need to be married for that, you don't even need to be in a civil partnership for that."

I feel like all men just want to date these toxic promiscuous women who post their bodies all over the internet and don't give a shit about a loyal kind gf who will always be there for them... 

Anyways what caused me to make this post is that I decided to start dating a guy. We were talking about our previous relationships (stupid I know). We eventually got to the subject of staying loyal/not cheating and being a virgin in a relationship. For me, I grew up with a strong opinion on having sex, where my mom said that men do care about how ""pure"" someone is regardless of what they actually say. Which is why I'm still a virgin since I am waiting for that special person who really cares about me and I don't want to be used just for my body... 

So I told him about my opinion on having sex, and then later in the convo he started talking about his previous relationship where his ex threatened to kill herself and cheated on him a lot.

dating,rsudsl,2021-12-31 13:53:50,Advice to men on their dating profile.,"So can we get a list of do's and don't's for men. I am looking at these profiles and I can't even figure out how they are so bad at this. 

1. If you have a ton of typos, just don't say anything. Intelligence is attractive. 
2. Stop with the blurry photos!!!!!! This is almost 2022. Photos are not grainy. Oh and speaking of photos, stop using memes and pictures of other women and children in your life. We have no idea who these women are and if we date, I can see your children. It's not a turn on seeing you hugging your mom or taking your kids out. 
3. I don't care about your car, stop telling me about it or putting it in your profile. 
4. Blah, blah we are all honest, loyal, don't cheat.... Everyone says that. Tell me about you and don't forget to use spell check. 
5. Be honest about your intentions!!!! Some girls just want sex too 
6. Do not and I repeat, DO NOT offer a dick pic to any girl you are talking to until she has had it in her body. Biggest turn off ever and gets an immediate block. 
7. Can we go back to the picture thing again? Take a few close up but we need to see more than just your head. Let me see your upper body, let me see full shots. Put some effort in it. Ask your sister, ask your female friend, ask a Co worker to look at your profile. And even if you smoke,  get that out of your mouth and off your profile. It's not sexy. 

Stop complaining that you aren't successful on these sites when you have put zero effort into it!!!!!","Can confirm.

I did the things OP suggests here while doing OLD pre-pandemic and had more dates than I had time and money to go on.

dating,lc0nia,2021-02-03 22:49:05,I hate being criticized for having a preference for asian women as a white male,"I'm(27M) white, and ever since I started finding girls cute, I had a strong preference for asian women. I grew up in the bay area in California, and there is a large filipino and vietnamese population there. I was never criticized growing up for my preference, until I moved to florida when I was around 24 for graduate school. My preference became labeled by many as a fetish, and it made me feel very uncomfortable. I was even called a ""colonizer"" once. Not to my face, but still.  
I can see that in places where there is a very small demographic of asian ethnicities, the women get called ""exotic"", and they're looked at very differently than back home. I also see this online as well.  
My issue is trying to navigate this new hurdle I'm facing. To me, having a preference for asian women is no different than a preference for brunettes, or latinas, or blue eyes. So why do I get lumped in with the weirdos?

Women are too afraid of rejection. There it is. That's the secret. You no longer need to ask women this anymore. The secret is out.

dating,dn3x1v,2019-10-25 21:13:05,What's the best way of not paying for a girl's drink on a date?,"On dates I offer a drink because if I'm getting one, it looks a bit bad if I don't offer one. However I end up paying for both drinks. Because paying for a girl these days doesn't make her like you or doesn't guarantee sex or sexual intimacy, it just means I'm wasting money buying drinks for girls who usually ghost me afterwards. I know 1/3 girls admitted to using men for free meals in a recent study, so I'm very wary of being used in this way.

What's the best way of stopping this? I don't want to pay for girls' drinks anymore. It's a waste of money and they're never grateful for it. But at the same time I want a drink myself. Thoughts?

edit: I guess despite equality, men are still expected to pay for women","Simple solution: Don't take her somewhere with drinks.

As far as 'being used'.. I 'use' women by going on dates with them to get better at dating.

As a male I can say its not true. You have to understand how men think in order to understand this.

Let's first assume a scenario where a man meets his dream woman. Would he want only sex from her? No, of course not. He wants her to be his gf.

A dream woman does not exists but it's does not mean men does not have standards for a gf.
Now men have two standards:
1. For a gf.
2. for casual sex.

The standard of a gf is much higher than a casual sex. When you talk with some man and he thinks you don't fit to be his gf you may fit for casual sex. In that case he will try to sleep with you but not to have relationship with you. You basically got rejected for the gf position but not for the sex position. 

Women filter a lot for potential bf and it's acceptable, they just does not have or want to have a standard fit casual sex. 
Men filter a lot too for gf, they just can accept casual sex much easily. 

So if men only offer you sex it means none of them saw you as a gf option and try to think why.",">You basically got rejected for the gf position but not for the sex position.

Endless amounts of that are worthless and we may as well not even get any matches for all that does.

Then the 10% left is the the whole mutual attraction thing (yes, it works both ways for both sexes), and if you actually can stand being with the person. 

I've been on too many dates where the guy spends a good part of it complaining about women, making racist jokes, has no concept of respecting boundaries and is aggressively handsy and predatory.

An even smaller percent of the time, he's perfectly great, but there's just no spark.

dating,r44idj,2021-11-28 13:38:55,"Ladies: How do you know when someone is an ""Alpha Male""?","I (39M) was on a first date last night, and at one point as we start to talk about dating in general she (40F) mentions that she is into doms, and can even spot a ""fake dom"" from a ""real dom"", and then says she is really only attracted to ""alpha male"" personality types.

In retrospect I should have followed up with her at that moment and asked specifically how she could tell when someone is an alpha male, or how she can tell if someone is a dom from a conversation (or even what the difference between a fake dom and a real dom is), but honestly in the moment the comment just really irked me. I get that we all have preferences and types that we like, but saying it out loud to the person you are out with just seems like drawing a box and saying ""either get in this box or I won't be interested in you."" It would be like if I said ""Well I tend to only be attracted to women who sleep with me on the first date...."" . So rather than follow up on it I just let the conversation keep going in a different direction.

But after a night of thinking it over, it really does have me wondering, how does a woman tell if a guy is an ""alpha male""? Especially in the current climate where being potentially controlling can be seen as an extreme negative and a red flag that boundaries won't be respected?

As far as myself, I wouldn't say I'm ""beta"".. I'm not a pushover, I stand up for myself and my opinions and communicate openly about what I want, I am not timid.. but I'm also not forceful or controlling, I'm pretty flexible and ""go with the flow"" at times, and especially with the social climate of the fourth wave feminism period we are in I tend to maybe be even deferential to the woman on a date (things like choosing where to meet, what activity she's inclined to do, etc) to make sure that she's comfortable with everything we are doing/is going on.

And no, the date didn't go anywhere. It was actually probably the fastest first date I've ever had, two drinks over an hour and a half and then we left and went our separate ways. Nothing really bad happened (I don't think), there just really wasn't much of any chemistry or connection.",Man to man. Don‚Äôt overthink it bro who gives a fuck.

https://imgur.com/a/CWdQ039","Sadly this is how it is. White men in America are the most desired race and the dating statistics prove it. White men generally get the most responses and attention on dating apps while black men and Asian men get the least.


Understand that people have preferences and notions about whom they want to be with. Work on being thr exception to their rule and being the best version of yourself. Plenty of women say ""no black/Asia/other race"" here and end up finding a man who is of that race and checks all the boxes. If you're attractive, have good financial stability, and your attitude is solid, you won't have to worry.

dating,osobym,2021-07-27 14:51:28,I think I'm done,"I've been dating a guy for around a month.  He would go on and on about how much he liked me, text me two, three times a day just to ask me how it's going, talk about how he was only looking for a serious relationship, introduced me to all his friends.  After the third date (and having sex) I found out he was dating someone else just as seriously as me.  (He also seemed like he wanted me to be mad about it, arguing that if I was doing the same things he would be upset and jealous.)  I was not okay with this but decided to move forward with the relationship thinking that I could get around it and try my best.  We had a discussion about it and I told him there would be a point were he needed to choose and he seemed okay with that.  

Now, this isn't a post about how one person has severely messed up my ability to date or that he is entirely a garbage human being because there were a lot of parts of him that I liked, and still do like, which just makes things harder.  I have had many dating experiences that have corroded my ability to trust other people in a romantic setting.  I can be intense when I have decided on someone, and my anxiety disorder does not lend well to that. I have always felt pressure to be a happy-go-lucky person when it comes to dating men because they don't want to see the bad stuff and if they do they see it as a red flag and immediately discount you.  So I tend not to admit what I'm thinking besides the good things and I made the mistake of trusting too early on this one.

Last night, we had sex and he was very distant afterwards, wouldn't touch me which is a big deal because aftercare is an incredibly important part of the sex I like.  Because I am incredibly blunt person (again not my best quality) I asked him whether he liked me or did he just like having sex with me and he said he did not know. which was not what I thought he was going to say.  Keeping in mind he spent the last month telling me how much he liked me and the six hours previous of us hanging out together making plans for the future, holding hands, cuddling, etc.   He said that if I had asked him last week (before me having the honest conversation about dating other people) it would have been a different answer.  

I don't think I've felt like that in a long while, my entire body went cold and I immediately started having a panic attack.  I had to sit there for 45 minutes while he explained why he couldn't commit to me as a person and that he didn't want to see me anymore because I couldn't physically leave, my legs and arms were complete rocks and I think in my head I wanted him to take it back.  Then I drove 45 minutes home back to my apartment alone because the idea of staying overnight there made me go into a deeper panic attack.

I think this incident might be the last straw for me for a while.  I don't think I'm ready to date in the way that so many people my age do, where there is always someone else you have to compete with for the persons attention.  I just want someone to choose just me (is that selfish? I don't know).  I don't expect complete commitment so early but there is so much dishonesty in acting like you're in a relationship with someone while still actively seeing other people.  I've learned yet another valuable lesson and this one might be the end of it for me.",The guy is a player.  His actions are not aligning with his words. He has no integrity.

This message is for all of you who are lurking online looking for some validation on why you are alone on February 14th

VALENTINE'S IS A DAY WE TRY AND USE AS A EXCUSE TO SHOW LOVE (and buy overpriced trash)!! SO LOVE YOURSELF LIKE YOU WANT SOMEONE TO LOVE YOU (at a reasonable price)!!

There is something MENTALLY WRONG with our society if it is odd to have someone spend the holiday all about love and showing your feelings NOT SHOW THOSE FEELINGS TO THEMSELVES

If someone thinks you can't celebrate Valentine's Day with some self love is full of BULLSHIT and the holiday is wasted on them. Caring for yourself is just as important as caring for others, if not more

Just because you're by yourself on the holiday doesn't mean you can't enjoy yourself! 

-Get your favorite food and eat it! 
-Dress so well that you look in a mirror and  can't resist telling yourself how fabulous you are!
-Indulge in yout hobby or passion that makes you have a enjoy your time on the world!
-Spend time with your other loved ones that and tell them how much they mean to you!
-Remind yourself that you're a star and deserve happiness!

At what point did things change?  When did it become a man's job to be a comedian, an adventurer, a poet and the Dos Equis guy?  It used to be that women wanted a man who would love them forever and provide for them and raise a family.  Now, I have to be a exploding with confidence, funny man who feels the need to climb Mount Everest, bare chested and drinking a $300 scotch while holding her in one arm.

Give it a rest women.  **Most** of us are real human men.  We can't always be all of that stuff.  And sometimes I don't want to be any of it.  You do something interesting for a change and tell me a joke.","This woman is clearly a mess, and she is not representative of all women. Hopefully you find someone who is a good match for you, but that will be difficult if you hold resentments for 50% of the world's population."
dating,31nzre,2015-04-06 20:11:26,Game over: I've found the absolute worst guy on OKCupid.,"""I'm looking for serious relationships only. I understand why others might just want to fool around, but for me, that's just not worth the hassle.

I have very specific and strict requirements, which is why I have to be very detailed in this profile and take myself a lot more seriously than I do in general. To think that I once swore I would never be that guy with the laundry list profile, and yet, here I am. Just as well, since the person I'm looking for would certainly love being bombarded with useful information and wouldn't shy away from an army of paragraphs.

Dealbreakers I should give you a heads up about: I am childfree and sterilized. I am against 3rd wave feminism and political correctness. I favor compatibility over chemistry. I enjoy sex but do not see it as more important than any other fun activity.

=== My principles and beliefs ===

I value truth above all, even above my or others' comfort. I believe in honesty, logic, pragmatism, directness in action and thought. Feelings and empathy have their time and place, but logic should always be at the core of one's life. While I don't go out of my way to wreck the illusions of everyone around me, whenever I am to express my beliefs and opinions, I do so openly and truthfully even if they may be uncomfortable for others. For me, there is no other way to be, and I am looking for someone who is the same: direct, brutally honest, level-headed.

I believe nothing should ever be guarded from examination or discussion. My thoughts and conversations can go anywhere, and so should yours. Nothing turns me off more than someone who has a taboo or goes out of their way to avoid offending anyone.

The world is full of misinformation and parties that would try to deceive us for their own gain, and as such, I believe that critical thinking and a skeptical attitude are two of the most important tools one can have in one's arsenal. I strive to keep these tools honed and ready and I ask the same of you. I need someone that is free of any major delusions and has a respectably high Bullshit Resistance Quotient.

I greatly value freedom and the principle of personal responsibility, and am allergic to any dogmatic or totalitarian system. We need to be in agreement on this. It bothers me deeply when someone believes they know better how other people should live their lives and that they would be willing to force those people to live according to their vision.

Christopher Hitchens is a good real-life example of what I strive to be like - not necessarily his specific ideas, but rather his general approach to life and discussion. A pity that no female clones of him are known to exist.

=== On feminism ===

Feminism seems to be a hot topic in the Western world nowadays, and one of frequent contention between me and most women, so it deserves a special mention. Let me begin by saying that I am all for gender equality of opportunity, which is to say that men and women should have equal rights and obligations, be equal in the eyes of the law, and be held to the same standard. Note that this does not imply equality of outcome, which is a result of their personal choices (which are not guaranteed to be the same) made within the context of those equal opportunities. That said, it is my firm opinion that 3rd wave feminism is not even remotely a force for actual justice and equality, and instead shows all the hallmarks of a dangerous cult. I will not go into details here, but suffice it to say that if you genuinely believe that there is such a thing as a ""patriarchy"" or ""rape culture"", ""white privilege"", etc., you are a victim of indoctrination and the best thing for us would be to not cross paths. There is no way I can convince you that you're in the wrong within a short amount of time, no more than I could convince a devout Christian that Jesus is no more real than Santa Claus.

=== On relationships ===

I don't share and I don't play games. You're either with me, or you're with someone else. You're either interested, or you're not. I understand why others might like toying around or poly relationships, but that's not my thing. Banter, vagueness and mystery are more suited for teens and few have the talent to do them well anyway.

On the other hand, don't think that we'll be joined at the hip. A healthy relationship means we each have our own awesome lives and interests, which are regularly enhanced by our partner's presence. I need my own space and I will only too gladly allow you yours. Ultimately, we need to strike a balance between time spent together and time spent apart.

On love, infatuation and 'chemistry': I view all forms of irrational attraction the same way I view drugs, which, ultimately, they are. Drugs can be fun and provide unique experiences, but I would not take important decisions while under their influence, and most certainly not allow them to rule my life in general. It seems to me people only really start to understand this well into their 30s, but I'm hoping you may be precocious in that regard.

=== On sex ===

For reasons mostly beyond my control, I happen to be still a virgin. This is not a big deal for me and my expectation is that it will not be a problem for you, either. I certainly want our relationship to be physical, and the way I see it, there will be plenty of time for us to work over any initial inexperience and awkwardness.

I felt I had to mention this because I have noticed that many women on dating sites, if their profiles are to be believed, seem to be inordinately preoccupied with sex (a resounding failure of stereotypes if ever there was any) and very strict about the frequency and performance requirements involved, far more so than for more, one would think, more fundamental aspects of compatibility such as character and principles. This mindset is simply alien to me.
What I‚Äôm doing with my life
I work full-time as a software engineer at a pretty cool company and I am lucky enough to enjoy it most of the time. I naturally plan to develop my career further and perhaps even strike out on my own some day. Engineering is probably the best field to be in nowadays and the palette of options is enormous, if only you are committed to constantly bettering yourself and learning new things. Which I am, and you likely will be, too.

In my free time, which, sadly, never seems sufficient, I bite into that ""to-read"" list of mine that never seems to stop growing (mostly non-fiction nowadays), and, like any geek, work on personal software and hardware projects, and enjoy the occasional video game.

I am also seriously studying the piano. I have had my grade 1 exam recently and plan to take this as far as it will go. My current dream in this regard is to be able to play Rachmaninov's 2nd piano concerto and not have (too many) rotten tomatoes thrown at me. Realistically, it will take decades to get to that level, but it is a sacrifice I am willing to make.

I go to the gym regularly, fighting that eternal battle of keeping healthy and in shape. I also enjoy bouldering / indoor climbing and, though I've had to pause it due to an injury, I hope to be able to get back into it soon.

I have grand plans for the next years, in that I would like to try scuba diving and skydiving, as well as visit the world, in particular ancient ruins and generally areas less spoiled by human presence. Perhaps I will also consider taking up drawing again, as I used to be quite good at it back in the day.

Most importantly, and this is something where we absolutely must agree completely, my plans for life do not include children. I feel no need for them and I am not willing to make the near total sacrifice they require. I think one either lives for one's children, or one lives for oneself. And lord knows, there is still a lot of living I intend to do for myself. To avoid accidents and other issues, and to be sure that the capabilities of my body are in agreement with my lifestyle, I have had a vasectomy and am now sterile. There is thus no room for negotiation on this topic, but if you are the right woman for me, chances are this will not have even occurred to you, and you might well be sterilized yourself. I do not require this of you, but it would go a long way into demonstrating that you are equally committed to a childfree life.

Favorite books, movies, shows, music, and food:

First, anything featuring good humor. So pretty much anything British, with a special mention for Monty Python, Fry&Laurie, and, for books, Terry Pratchett (who somehow manages to stick a plot and characters we care about, as well as pretty much half of TVTropes in any of his books).

I also like anything bizarre, that plays with conventions and the reader (""mindfuck""), is psychological, sappy, tragic, dystopian, meta or various combinations of these. Think Kafka, Brazil, Kynodontas, and nearly all manga. While we're on that subject, I'd like to state that I consider comics and videogames to be absolutely serious forms of art, and anyone that thinks any different is begging to be on the receiving end of my Adama Glare.

I can be quite eclectic with my music, but a large part of what I like is Romantic classical/opera (Beethoven, half of Mozart, Verdi, Tchaikovsky, Rachmaninov, Glazunov), and anything based on blues (Satchmo, early rock'n'roll, 60-70s bands) with a special mention for The Who and The White Stripes. I also adore Kate Bush, Peter Gabriel, TMBG and Lemon Demon.
I spend a lot of time thinking about
Many, many, many things. Thinking is something I do a lot, and I'm not ashamed to say it. To give you an example: how eventually humans and robots are destined to merge and become beings that we could never hope to understand. Not all of my thoughts are that serious, of course,

Also, when I'm in a classical mood I can spend quite some time replaying entire operas and symphonies. In my head. In their entirety. Feel free to back away slowly.

You should message me if:

You are direct, honest, pragmatic, savvy, not afraid to speak your mind or question anything and everything.

You have your life together, you know what you want, and are past the games and vacillations of teenagers.

You do not have, or want, children, and are are very confident in this decision.

You know that life involves a constant drive to learn new things and better oneself. You have the patience to work on yourself, and let your partner work on himself as well.

You have an excellent, one might say even wicked, sense of humor. You enjoy all kinds of jokes, from the nonsensical to the morbid and naughty.

You want us to meet and see how we get along in person, instead of passing around boring emails :)

Not that it will get you off the hook, but I admit to a weakness for dark eyes, a fringe cut, and well defined eyebrows. Think Winona Ryder.""

dating,141npnx,2023-06-05 18:32:45,"Women do want sex as much as men, but here's the thing...","I am of the mindset that men and women have an equal desire for sex. Women of course have far more access to sex and that's where the confusion comes in, men don't have nearly the ability to get sex as women do so how can you say both equally want sex?

So here's the thing...for men we rarely have truly bad sex. And what's bad sex? Sex so poor that you would rather not have had it. Most men can have not great sex, or just ok sex but sex so awful you would have rather just beat off? Thats not common for men. Without trying to brag I've had less than 60 sex partners but more than 10, somewhere in there and I can count on one hand how many times I've had truly bad sex where i wish she didn't come over or I had stayed home and I believe most men would say similar things. For women however it's very common to have bad sex. A guy can have a small d*ck, a big d*ck and not know how to use it, he might cum really quickly he might not be that experienced etc etc etc. So what happens is women will want sex but she also knows that if she has sex with a new guy she is possibly more likely to have bad sex than good sex. This is why when women have a partner or a guy who gives them good sex their sex drive is so high because they know they will get quality sex from them.

So this is why it often looks like women don't want sex as much as men...they have access to far more potential partners then men do but for them its quantity over quality and for men it's the reverse.

Your thoughts?","I'm not worried about bad sex or good sex, guys coming quickly or how big their dick is.

I'm worried about guys not respecting me, ignoring my boundaries, refusing to use protection, refusing to help me get off, or straight up assaulting or even murdering me.

With the exclusion of the last one (getting killed), I've had all of those happened and only been sexually active for five years. 

That's why most women are selective."

I ask where they're meeting people and the answer is always the same...online dating.

I'm sorry but 90% of communication is non-verbal, right? I'm convinced online dating apps are just money-making schemes that convince people they can find someone sitting on their ass in their own home when in reality meeting someone requires *actual* effort, aka going out alone to activities you enjoy & talking to random people, male or female.

A wide social circle is the best way to meet people. And I say that as an introvert who doesn't naturally enjoy that process. I met my boyfriend at an art museum after years of going there alone hoping to meet a fellow person into art.

Online dating promises you'll meet someone easily; real life teaches you everything takes long-term effort.

And yes, some people find their partners on OLD, but most people on OLD aren't super invested in it or want validation, so you're wasting your time yet so lazy or deluded you don't put the real work into meeting people irl, and then whine you've been on OLD for years yet had zero success.

dating,p47gpr,2021-08-14 12:51:54,Getting a girlfriend (a.k.a winning) should NOT be your end goal!,"Hello, to the incredible dating community!

After being active for several months here, I've seen most of the guys are trying to get a girlfriend no matter what. In other words trying to win. Trying to get what they need.

Unfortunately, in building a healthy dating life, that's the worst thing you can do. Let me explain you why!

So, in my mid twenties I didn't have a clue about women, how to date, how to not getting ghosted and how to get on a date through dating apps.. I was clueless, lonely and depressed. All I wanted was someone to understand me, hug me, and have beautiful moments with..  In my mind it was always: I want to get a girl, I want to have a relationship. 

üëâThe truth is, I was focusing on the end goal, which basically was to ""win the girl"". And every time I wasn't ""winning"", I was getting back thinking ""oh I have to be more handsome"", ""I have to build muscles"", ""I have to be perfect for the girl"", ""make more money"", watching endless YouTube videos about dating and social skills.. False perfectionism, in other words.

üëâAnd slowly, but steadily, I wasn't reaching my goals of being perfect, and that led me to procrastinate, and slowly giving up on the dating game. Every time that I had the opportunity to ""play with girls"" at the back of my head I was thinking ""I am not perfect yet, I am sure she will reject me"". And of course, being out of the game for so long, I stopped learning. And because I stopped learning, I was failing to get what I wanted. So I was stuck in this endless cycle of either I lose or I win.. 

And then again, because I wasn't winning, I was feeling discouraged and of course, I entirely GAVE UP. Again, feeling lonely and depressed and of course not good enough..

‚úÖ So, after some months of deep thinking and  by getting help by others, I start changing my mindset!! I stopped trying to win, but I've put all my focus on LEARNING!! You know why? Because, if your goal is to always learn, you CANNOT LOSE, and that's a beautiful thing! This was the opposite of perfectionism! Basically, every action I was taking was learning something new, by real life experience. So, just by taking small action steps, I was learning something new every time, and because my goal was to learn, I was WINNING EVERY TIME!!! Either I was learning something wrong or right, at the end of the day, I was learning and so again I was winning.

And, INEVITABLY as long as you do this, being in the cycle of learning, you are going to get more dates, and maybe the girl. And that will boost your self-confidence, and you will learn more and more. Will you be 10/10 confident? Of course not! But, adding up a little bit of self- confidence every time you take action is the only way to be successful.

And this my friend is the awesome cycle of building your self-confidence. An upward spiral of learning and learning and learning! 

So, if you read this post, stop focusing on winning, but put ALL OF YOUR FOCUS ON LEARNING!","Interesting. 

I didn't know there was a part of society that saw getting a partner as, ""winning"". Thanks for sharing."
dating,p3ncpx,2021-08-13 15:34:30,"I don't want to be the ""settle-down, safe option guy"".","**Note: Please read the entire post before commenting, because nothing pisses me off more than someone reading and focusing only one part of a post without getting the full context.** 

I know this might come off as an irrational fear. But I'm almost 28, with no dating experience. I feel like I missed out on the youthful dating experiences, and it makes me angry. And I refuse to be the ""settle-down, safe option"" guy. You know the guy women don't pay attention to during their ""wild years"", but now that they are ""ready to settle down"" they're finally interested. Granted, I'm not exactly a high earner. In fact, I'm only now finally close to getting what people consider a ""real job"" (I graduated college late, so yeah.). And I'm still working a little over minimum wage. 

I know I have to resolve this before anything else. I'm not even bothering with dating right now, because my job search is my main priority. But I want to make it clear, I am doing it for myself. I want to make a comfortable living. But I am not interested in being a corporate slave, and I'm definitely not interested in being some ""provider-type"" to some woman who's ""looking to settle down"". I want to experience the fun, youthful side of dating, where there are no ""end-goals"". Just sort of let things happen naturally (which is how dating should be anyway), without having the end in mind. And if it works out, great. And if it doesn't, hey at least I gained experience.

 I am against the idea of marrying the first girl I date. Heck I don't even know if I want to get married ever (maybe I'll change my mind someday, but maybe I won't). And before anyone says ""What if she's the perfect match?"" or ""What if she's inexperienced too?"". You are talking about a less than 1% possibility at best. Like seriously, both instances are exceptionally rare. 

So I refuse to be the ""safe option"" or ""end game"" for women who have the ""fun out of their system"" and are looking to ""land a husband"". I especially refuse to date women who are concerned about salaries. Cause chances are, they are looking for a ""husband/provider"" type too.",[deleted]

In my entire 23 years of life I have almost never seen a black man with even a semi-attractive women, black guys usually take whatever we can get because we know women **do not want us** at all and will only date us due to desperation or mental illness; idgaf about celebrities and athletes

***NOW,*** that's not true, but given the amount of instances I have experienced of trying, along with others, to impart constructive advice and input based on personal preferences and success stories and having them angrily and insecurely dismissed, I figured I'd finally just cave and tell you what you're so desperately clamoring to hear.  


You have a choice between two narratives: the first, that due to your poor hand in genetic poker, you are inherently and immutably destined to live out a life of loneliness and rejection as a result of the inherent deviousness of superficial ***f e m a l e s***, and nothing can ever change that; or, the second, that maybe, *just maybe*, there are factors within your control that are not insignificant contributors to your lack of romantic success, and that things *can*, in fact, get better. ***Bottom line***, which of those two would you prefer to subscribe to?  


Listen, assholes, I used to be like you. In my teen and early college years I was chronically romantically unsuccessful and single, I had internalized some misguided and misogynistic notions of social interaction and ways that women think (spoiler alert: it actually turns out they're people just like you), I reacted with anger and spite when rejected, and was generally getting increasingly and increasingly bitter and misanthropic. During this interval, I did little-to-no substantial self-examination, so I never really significantly improved. At some point, via emotional maturation as well as the influence of platonic friendships with many women, I began to become aware of the flaws in my personality that were largely turning people off in romantic *and* platonic capacities. Were these realizations of my failings and missteps fun to acknowledge and grapple with? Hell no, but I took them seriously anyway and began putting in serious and dedicated work in order to improve my social and romantic lot-- *as well as just make myself feel generally better!* Fuck's sake, don't do it for other people-- do it for your own peace of mind.  


As time went on, I went from going largely unnoticed and routinely rejected by women to getting lots of positive romantic attention and becoming fairly sought out and successful. Currently, I'm well over a year into the best relationship I've ever been in with someone about whom I feel more strongly and who is a better fit for me than anyone I've ever known before. This shift has occurred gradually over the past decade, and I can tell you with a significant degree of certainty that I am both the same height and race now as I was ten years ago when I was perpetually romantically unsuccessful, so, I don't know, maybe it was about less superficial factors and I'm onto something here.  


Five-to-ten years ago I could have succumbed to the narrative that I was, due to factors out of my control, destined to be undateable and alone ad infinitum. But that would have been weak and cowardly. Instead, I chose to take the harder tack and grow the fucking stones to look my flaws in the face and put forth the work to fix them and, in doing so, myself. And things got better. Things got *a lot* better-- with no substantial changes to my physical appearance.  


The choice is yours, boys-- which I refer to you as because your behavior is closer in kind to immature children than any kind of emotionally-developed adult. This sub *reeks* of the indication that y'all don't actually want any constructive criticism or to put forth any kind of effort to actually improve your lot, and instead just want mindless validation of the a priori narrative you've subscribed to because it's easier and absolves you of any semblance of accountability or responsibility. You can make the harder choice to do some deep diving and turn inward to make significant positive changes, or you can take the spineless route of giving into your toxic narrative and continue to believe that you are inherently insufficient, unfuckable, and unlovable. Because I'll go ahead and tell you that if you want to hear it.  


But it's a fucking pathetic choice and makes you just the same.",TL DR: guy takes 10 years to get a girlfriend and now wants people to think it‚Äôs not that difficult.
dating,koxbx5,2021-01-02 13:17:21,I am just fucking sick and tired of not having access to affection or sex,"I‚Äôve literally done everything I possibly can at this point during these lonely times. I‚Äôve tried all the dating apps. Tried all the advice I‚Äôve gotten on how to do dating apps right. When I couldn‚Äôt get a single date with a girl I started dating men. That didn‚Äôt really do it for me. I am so much more attracted to women. Then I started experimenting with gender fluidity and I‚Äôm now thinking I‚Äôm trans but attracted to women. So I tried dating women as a lesbian too. And as a trans woman. Mostly a bunch of scammers on those apps.

Maybe I just need to get my balls hacked off asap and just get on hormones. That may very well destroy my libido and it would be for the best. This is where I‚Äôm at. I‚Äôm sick of my sexual desire. It‚Äôs a dead end. Loads of demand with zero supply. That‚Äôs what this market looks like apparently.

I really don‚Äôt get why it has to be like this. If everyone were like me, we‚Äôd all just be fucking left and right not as the stupid power play it currently is but because we genuinely enjoy it. And more importantly, we enjoy pleasing other people. And we want them to be happy.

Now as a 28 year old man I don't see the point, marriage is a concept that has been around for ages, it's main purpose has been to guarantee a woman kids and financial security because women had so few options in many cultures.

But today there's no point women have all the opportunity, maybe even preferential treatment in society most post secondary graduates are women and all it takes to lose your job is a bad accusation from a woman.

For men it's all financial risk you could end up paying alimony for the rest of your life, child support for the next 18+ years and the family courts give women most of the valuable assets.

I may sound angry or bitter but these are the facts I'm honestly neither since I don't plan on having kids or be married I'm just wondering why some people put so much value on marriage when there's really no need for it and co habitation has become the norm.","You sound quite misogynistic... women don‚Äôt have the greatest deal in everything, simmer down."

I hope this message finds you all well.

I am a video journalist at a large digital news publication in New York City and I am working on a video about what dating is like right now, in times when we are unable to meet up in person. We are getting into topics like video dating, digital first dates, and long distance dating, and we would love to speak to some people first hand about their experiences. 

This is not exclusive to the US and we would love to get some international input as well. We are simply looking for personal stories, from anywhere and everywhere, that people would be willing to share with us so that we can shed some light on an industry that is going through obvious and unforeseen changes in that face of a pandemic. 

If anyone is interested in talking to us for this story please send me a private message and we can go from there. Thanks much in advance!",Wah?

dating,c2vl1s,2019-06-20 12:50:14,Why you should never have a serious relationship with a girl that puts out on the first date......,"tldr at the bottom

&#x200B;

I met a girl back in the mid 80's who was stranded along the side of the road with the hood of her 1983 Corvette up in the air.  I gave her a ride home and arranged for my friend with a tow truck to pick it up and bring it to the Chevy Dealership.  We got to talking, then went out for dinner, drinks, and some dancing that same night.  We hit it off.  I dropped her back off at her very large home on Lake Minnetonka (a newer McMansion type) and thought I would give her a very nice goodnight kiss and that would be it.  

&#x200B;

She wanted more, much, much more.  She invited me in and against my better judgment but not able to fight the raging hormones of a young man in his very early 20's, I accepted it.  She asked me to sleep with her and we did everything but sleep lol.  I was seeing a pattern form in my early years where I would ask a woman out on a date and we would end up sleeping together the first night.  Shortly after, the relationship would crash and burn because relationships built on sex, rarely succeed.  It takes a certain type of crazy woman to sleep with a man on a first date.  They usually are NOT long term relationship material.

&#x200B;

However, we seemed to get along really great and she was richer than God and didn't have a problem ""sharing"" her wealth with me.  Her daddy owned a large private corporation and she was a VP in it.  She was loyal, faithful, not overly clingy unless we were alone, had no problems with me going out or hanging out with my friends, in fact, she encouraged it telling me she had no doubts I was faithful to her.  We simply got along and ""Got"" each other.  She would never turn me down for sex or a blow job no matter how tired she was or even volunteered to do it if she was sick.

&#x200B;

Things were just humming along great in our relationship and she even went on the pill so we didn't have to use condoms even though the pill made her ill from time to time.  She bought me expensive gifts I didn't ask for like my own 1969 Corvette, a new Ford F150 that was jacked up and a replica ""Captain America"" Chopper from the movie Easy Rider that she had custom built.  While I accepted the gifts, I felt uneasy about taking them and demanded they stay titled in her name.  She agreed as long as if we got married some day (something she always dropped very subtle hints about) then they along with EVERYTHING she owned, would be titled in our names together.  She even said she would not allow me to sign a pre-nup because she just KNEW when, not if, we got married we would be together forever.

&#x200B;

But alas, there were some cracks that started to show in our relationship, personality quarks if you will, on her part.  They were slow to happen and started off very minor.  So slow, I didn't even notice them.  One day she asked me to move in with her into her 9 bedroom Mansion.  I agreed and it took me about 2 hours to pack my stuff and have it all moved in and put away.  I really didn't have much and I didn't need much as her home had everything.

&#x200B;

After I moved in I noticed she was trying to slowly change me, first it was the way I looked and dressed.  I was always a jeans and t-shirt kind of guy with work boots or tennis shoes.  She had me visit a tailor who custom made some suits for me to have.  I worked construction most of the year and was finishing my college degree up as well.  When I asked her why she had so many suits made up for me she said that my 6'7"" 240 lb muscled frame just looked so damn sexy in them.  She was right, I did look damn good in them and started wearing them whenever we went out to dinner, etc.  About the only time I didn't wear them when we went out was when we went to a Minnesota Twins or Vikings game that she had season tickets to.

&#x200B;

She also started dropping seriously hard hints about getting engaged and married.  Whenever we went shopping at the mall she would stop and look at the Rings at different Jewelers.  Mind you, these ""Rings"" were NOT the ones you see in the display cases, they were ones that were brought out from the vault and you had to sit in a small private room to look at them.  Most of them were north of $40k.  I would tell her I couldn't afford those types of prices and she said I could since all of her money would be OUR money.  She even shared the balances in the several bank accounts she had with me and she had already accumulated a couple of million not including her investments. 

&#x200B;

One day I got home from work early because of a rain day and that was the day our relationship crashed and burned.  No, I didn't come home to her screaming in orgasmic bliss while being banged by some guy.  IT WAS WORSE.......

&#x200B;

As I walked into the house, the phone was ringing so I answered it.  It was my loving girlfriend, she was at work and needed some papers that were in her home office (one of the 9 bedrooms in the house).  She asked if I could run them over to her office and I told her no problem.  As I walked down the hall, fate or something like that, intervened in my life.  I heard the very light sound of music, almost like a jewelry box music, just for a few seconds coming from one of 2 of the bedrooms that were always locked that I never looked in. She had told me they were just loaded with her stuff that she had no place to put but was from her childhood and she just didn't want to get rid of it.

&#x200B;

I kept going to her office, grabbed the papers but stopped and decided to look around in her office for keys to those rooms.  Sure enough, they were in one of the drawers of her desk.  I opened the first room up, the one the music had come from and it was very dark.  I turned the light on and what I saw was astounding.........  The room was full of brand new baby stuff.  There were 4 cribs, several hanging mobiles above them (this was the music sound I had heard).  There were boxes and boxes of baby diapers, clothing, toys, etc.  I walked in and couldn't believe what I was seeing.  WTF was all this stuff doing in there???

&#x200B;

In another twist of fate, as I was inside the room checking all the stuff out, the door slowly closed most of the way shut.  I was thinking her and I needed to have a serious discussion about the contents of this room.  While I MIGHT be willing to marry her soon, I didn't want kids for several years yet.  I was only 21 at the time.  As I turned to leave, I saw the back of the door and on it was several large calenders with weeks blocked off and a couple of days circled.  It didn't take a genius to tell she was using them to track her fertility schedule.  On top of the dresser was a nearly empty prescription bottle that was home to some fertility pills in them.  Alongside was some information about taking them and what kind of results could be expected regarding a pregnancy.

&#x200B;

What really freaked me out was what the fertility pills looked like.  I quickly ran into our master bath and checked the medicine cabinet and pulled out the bottle of her ""Speciality"" Birth Control Pills.  The ones she said the Doctor had prescribed so she wouldn't get as sick as the normal pills that came in a daily reminder container......

&#x200B;

THE FERTILITY PILLS AND HER BIRTH CONTROL PILLS LOOKED EXACTLY THE SAME.

&#x200B;

She WASN'T taking Birth Control Pills as she told me, she was taking Fertility Pills.

&#x200B;

At this point, I had to sit down on the bed and chill out as I was nearly hyperventilating.

Suddenly I decided I needed to see what was in that other locked room.  I went and unlocked the door, braced myself for probably seeing even more baby stuff but when I turned the light on...........IT WAS EVEN WORSE.

&#x200B;

THE ROOM WAS SET-UP LIKE A SHRINE......................... TO ME.

&#x200B;

There were pictures all over the walls of me from not only the time we started dating but what appeared to be several months before that as some of them I was with some other women I had been seeing BEFORE I met her.  There was also a file cabinet in the room and it had tons more pictures in them as well as what appeared to be reports from a Private Investigation company on and all about me.  On the walls next to some of my pictures were things about me like my favorite foods, bands, hang-outs, etc.  

&#x200B;

Somehow, they knew things about me that I would only tell people I knew OR WAS TRYING TO GET TO KNOW.  That's when I found out, the last 2 ladies I was seeing were plants from the P.I. Company to essentially do Recon on me.

&#x200B;

I had a very odd mixture of feelings from feeling impressed someone did all this to ""meet me"" to feeling fear, anger and violated.  Suddenly, that ""Chance"" meeting from her Vette being broken down on the side of the road that I took on the way to my parents home in the country, didn't seem like such a ""Chance"" anymore.

&#x200B;

I didn't know what to do at that moment, I wanted to burst into her office and demand a ""Why, What is going on"" explanation.  I also felt like I wanted to just RUN away, fast and far.  I was known for making stupid rash heat of the moment decisions back then and this day would be no different.  I walked out of the room, called her up and told her I had a dead battery in the truck and because this was later in the fall, the motorcycle and Vette were both put away for the winter.  Because of this, I would have to wait for a while for the battery to charge.  She could tell something was wrong and when she asked I lied and told her it was stuff that happened at work today and I would tell her about it later.  She told me ok and then said not to worry about getting her the papers, she was going to just come home in a few hours and wanted to talk with me about some things.  I told her ok I would see her then.

&#x200B;

About 3 minutes after I hung up with her, I started to freak out and quickly packed all of my things I had when I moved in and left ALL of the things she had bought me, undisturbed.  I did go back into the ""Shrine Room"" and gathered all the pictures of me and the reports and brought them down and put them on the dining room table.  I then called a friend of mine and told him I needed a ride and for him to pick me up.  He did and saw the few duffle bags I had packed and I told him about everything.  He wanted to see it for himself and so we went in and I showed him.  The look on his face was priceless and probably a lot like mine was when I discovered it all.

&#x200B;

My friend told me I should take some of the pictures and reports for any evidence that I might need for later and thankfully I listened to him.  He told me I could hang out at his place for a while and he would cover for me.  While at his house we started drinking some and a few of my other friends came over and they promised when she called to say they hadn't seen me.  But they suggested I get out of Dodge really quick because she would probably send the P.l. Company out looking for me.

&#x200B;

I was really on the verge of losing what was left of my mind about this.  I made another Rash decision and reached into my backpack I used at the University and pulled out a card I had been given by a man who had been recruiting me hard for a job opportunity.  They had said I met all of their criteria for a position that was available because I could speak both German and Russian, fluently.  My Russian even had a Czech accent thanks to my Gramma Helen who taught it to me when I was a kid. 

&#x200B;

I dialed the number and told the man I was in and how soon could I leave for training.  He told me since I was already approved and had passed all the background checks (none of them I had agreed to), he could have me on a plane down to Langley by the coming weekend.  I told him I wanted to do it so he set it up.

&#x200B;

My flight was leaving Saturday afternoon and all I had to do was stay off of her radar until then, 4 days.  I called my parents and told them what was going on and what I was doing.  They said I was being impulsive and I should go back and talk with her.  I told them it wasn't going to happen.  They did not like the idea I was joining the CIA but knew there was little they could do about it.

&#x200B;

For the rest of the week, I rarely went out and when I did it was for short periods of time.  My friends had all been contacted by her numerous times and she was crying and pleading to them to get a message to me that she needed to talk with me and explain what was going on and what I had seen wasn't really what I thought it was.  HUH???

&#x200B;

Saturday came and I met the man at the Airport where he gave me my ticket and all the information I would need when I got there.  As I was walking away towards my Airline Gate, I was stopped by 4 Police Officers and 6 Airport Security Guards.  They had me turn around and handcuffed me.  The CIA recruiter saw this and asked the Police what was going on and they told him to back off or they would cuff him too.  Their demeanor changed the second he pulled out his CIA credentials and suddenly the Police became very compliant.  They said I was being arrested for Sexual Assault and RAPE.

&#x200B;

Apparently, my EX-girlfriend had found out I was flying out of the Airport that day and in a desperate move to prevent it, had told the Police that I had forced myself on her the previous night and assaulted and raped her.  The Police had to take me in and when I got there and was processed, she was able to come into the room I was being questioned in and confessed to everything in front of me.  Luckily, the Police were observing on the other side of the glass and had a video camera running in the room so they heard her say she made it all up to stop me from leaving because she wanted to explain things to me.

&#x200B;

I told her she was completely insane and needed Professional Help.  She got mad and told me she did all of it because she LOVED ME and had Loved Me since we had met at a bar in Minneapolis about 6 months before I ""rescued"" her alongside the road.  She said we danced a few times, talked a bit, and that we even made out in a booth at the bar for a while.  I didn't remember any of this but I do remember getting pretty drunk a few times back then at the bars so I actually did believe her.  She said when I held her dancing to a slow song and leaned down to kiss her during it, her body was blasted with electric pulses she had never had in her life and just knew I was ""The One"".  

&#x200B;

All she had was my name and the fact I worked construction and was finishing up my final year at the University to go off of so she contacted a P.I. Company her Company uses and had them find me and do all kinds of checks on me.  She said it was for their Corporation when it was really for her, personally.  I told her we were DONE and I didn't want to ever speak or see her again.  Then she dropped another bomb and said she might be pregnant as her period was late.

&#x200B;

What I told her next was so shocking to even me, I knew I had to get away from her.  I told her if she is, she should get an abortion (something I am dead set against) as I didn't want to have a kid(s) with her, EVER.  I also told her if she didn't, I wanted Paternity tests taken and that hit her hard because she knew that I normally would have trusted her completely.  I told her I could NEVER trust her again after seeing the deception she had pulled off.  I started screaming for the cops to come back into the room and get her out of there.  Nobody was more surprised than I was when they came in and put the cuffs on her and charged her with reporting a false crime.

&#x200B;

They ended up letting me go and my CIA buddy was waiting for me in the lobby.  He called and got me on the next flight out of there and it was to Atlanta Georgia where I would stay the night in a Hotel before flying out to Langley the next day.

&#x200B;

I never heard or saw my EX-Girlfriend again.  Although, after spending 3 years working for the CIA during the end of the Cold War, I was starting to think spending my time with her would have been less horrible lol.  And NO I WAS NOT A SPY.  Believe it or not, there are thousands of us people that did the REAL, not very sexy work at the CIA.  5 Days after I left the CIA I was heading for Orlando, Florida and to Navy Basic Training.  After that day I left Minnesota heading for my training with the CIA, it was several more years before I ever went back home to Minnesota.

&#x200B;

When I did, I essentially went from the Frying Pan that was my Ex-Girlfriend into the Fires of Hell at the hands of a very hot ex-beauty queen (another first date sex conquest), that would become my wife and eventually, my ex-wife after I testified at her Drug Trial.  But that is a story for another time.

This is such a vapid post and I never thought I'd say something like this but I have met my dream man, he ticks all of my boxes and we connect like crazy, its wild because I just got divorced after 7yrs with my ex so I'm very aware of the fact this guy is an exceptional fit for me.

I really could spend my life with this man but.... I can't get past the fact he has a small, thin penis. I know I'm awful.
My ex husband was a tall guy and his penis was about 9inches. And this guy isn't even half that.

My question is, is there a way I can get past the penis size? I enjoy penetrative sex more than any other style.

I wish I could get over it and be with him properly but it's definitely holding me back.

He's also quite big and not my physical type, so that also doesn't do much for me?

Ticks all boxes except the physical and I wonder if it's possible to be with someone long term without that attraction?

- Always initiating the conversation

dating,12k0l5f,2023-04-12 21:47:22,potentially unpopular opinion about why dating apps are hard for men,"i think about this a lot and besides the obvious turn offs (misogyny, unfunny, etc,) men just miss the mark a lot of the time. let‚Äôs talk general statements for heterosexual, cis gendered relationships for a sec. women tend to put quite a bit of work into their profiles; they pick cute photos with outfits they‚Äôre proud of, put a cute bio in, and fill in all the blanks. on the flip side, a lot of men don‚Äôt necessarily put a lot of effort into their personal style. outside of dating apps they don‚Äôt necessarily care and it reflects on dating apps, as well. who doesn‚Äôt love a man who can dress and either keeps up with the trends OR wears clothing that are flattering. the same can be said with photos, there‚Äôs just not a lot of effort put in. sure, if you‚Äôre considered photogenic you can get away with more but men don‚Äôt really try to take photos that really show themselves off in a good way, and i don‚Äôt mean showing more skin. just selfies and group photos that are flattering. and lastly, sometimes the bios are dreadful. if you‚Äôre looking for a hookup, putting your university and height is standard i guess but what about that would make someone want to swipe on you? there‚Äôs a small window of time to catch someone‚Äôs attention, you have to consider that. 

i feel like the dating app game has also changed because of social media. that‚Äôs not to say looks are the only thing that matter but people need to figure out their target audience. i know the ‚Äútype‚Äù of people who will not swipe on me and i have a pretty good gage on the people who will. similar interests is one thing but aesthetics matter to some people. and by aesthetics i absolutely don‚Äôt mean race, ethnicity, body type, etc. i‚Äôm talking style and how it appears someone holds themselves. especially when you‚Äôre meeting someone online and they can‚Äôt experience all you have to offer in person.  

personal care and confidence show, believe it or not. don‚Äôt settle for self deprecating jokes in your bio unless pity is what you‚Äôre trying to attract. be what you want to attract. you can have anyone you want so long as you embody the person who has that thing.","I agree that most guys have terrible profiles but girls definitely don't put in effort, especially to their bio, it's usually just one or two basic lines. 

And guys in general don't care about fashion or grooming, they're not just getting it wrong for the app, they're literally presenting themselves.

But the thing is you can let a girl setup your profile for you and it doesn't help, people have tried this and how you setup your profile doesn't really matter, you just either look good or you don't."

dating,nu2ax9,2021-06-07 02:56:06,CMV: Men get treated more harshly on same/similar actions than women.,"1. If a woman ghosts a man, people would say it is okay because she is concerned for her safety so ghosting is 100% okay even if the man in question never did anything wrong. While you are true that women are more statistically likely to be victims of violence, does it really absolve women in ALL cases of ghosting? Can we just accept that SOME women are just a-holes and have a convenient excuse to use so they dont seem like one? Jfc when the genders are reversed, you never see people telling the girl that she is being a creep. 
2. Women are allowed to expect a man to be for their meal even if they just met. But men cannot expect sex. While I think this might be a false equivalence since paying for a meal and letting someone else use your body is not the same, I feel like this social expectation allows some folks to take advantage of others. Nobody should have to pay for the date's meal when they just met for the first time period.
3. If a woman is being passive in texting, people will tell the man that it is because he is not interesting enough and he should put more effort. If a man is being passive, the women is told that it is not her fault and that she should just unmatch.

dating,do8pl8,2019-10-28 13:17:48,Why r/FemaleDatingStrategy/ give bad advice,"They are very focused on getting money and commitment and sure you could get that but will it really be someone you are attracted to? do you really need to sell your body for money? 

**You dont need his money**

Most women these days dont need males to give them resources, sure you can get that if you want but you dont really need that. Maybe you should instead focus on getting someone you are actually attracted to and that can satisfy you sexually. Do you want him to be the biological father of your children? 

**About sex without commitment**

You should have sex with an individual before committing to her or him, otherwise you dont know whether or not that aspect of a relationship will work. Unless you only want other things (such as money) you should have sex before marrying someone. 

I do believe that sexual activities with a partner will create a bond and this can explain why some individuals dont like being promiscuous, even if you are male you may not actually want to have sex with someone you clearly dont want as a long term girlfriend.","Their sidebar reads like a shitty version of The Red Pill, they claim to be about female empowerment but expect the guy to always pay, and their core philosophy is not about finding an equal."
dating,rg3sek,2021-12-14 09:25:17,"""Man must pay"" needs to die","*Inspired by* [*this recent post*](http://redd.it/rfne7f/) *, I want to* *~~voice~~* *rant my opinion on this separately, since it will just get lost among the many replies already there.*

IMHO, the tradition that the guy must always pay for the first date is ***outdated***, ***sexist***, ***materialistic***, and ***disrespectful*** to both men and women. I'm not in favor of the death penalty, but this tradition should be shot and buried in an unmarked grave, and the sooner the better. Traditions are just peer pressure from dead people - so let *them* have it!

Saying ""the one who invites is the one who pays"" may be a little better if women made the first move more often; but in the current reality where this still falls mostly on men, this is just saying the same thing in prettier words. (Which is a good place to repeat the call to women everywhere: *if you like us, approach us!* Don't wait for us to make the first move. Most of us will appreciate it.)

Why do I think this way?

The **sexist** part should be quite clear: expecting different things based solely on a person's gender, and judging them differently for it. AKA, discrimination. If a guy doesn't pay, he's ""cheap"", ""uninterested"", ""has no manners"", ""not a gentleman"", ""a looser"", ""pathetic"", etc. If a girl doesn't pay, she's fine; it's not her job.

It's **outdated** because it's based on a world where men were the breadwinners and women stayed at home to cook and clean. We no longer live in that world, at least not in the west. Women today are financially independent, they're capable, they have careers. Sometimes the woman makes more than the man (not getting into the whole wage gap debate here - I'm talking about individuals, not statistics).

It's **materialistic** since it gives *money* too much importance. It contaminates the interaction, and if such attitudes persist, it contaminates the relationship. Money is nice, it is useful, it is helpful. But when it becomes a key factor, we lose focus of what really matters. Money is volatile. Temporary. It comes and goes. Even a homeless person can find a job, and turn their life around. Even a millionaire can lose everything in a moment. And then what are you left with? The person themselves, their personality, how they treat you - *that's* what really matters. And those are the things that are much harder to fix.

It's **disrespectful to women** because it paints them in the same way the old world did. Weak, dependent, incapable. And when a woman insists that a man must pay, let alone when she forces him, or tricks him into it, or abuses the custom for her own benefit, I can think a several other titles for her, none of which are good. To women's credit though, those last few bad cases are rather rare. Or at least, I hope so.

And it's **disrespectful to men** because it takes them for granted. It takes *their generosity* for granted. It treats them like an ATM. Judges them by the content of their bank account. Is that all that a man is worth to you? A wallet? Surely not.

If you want to judge a man's character, his manners, his interest, there are better ways than relying on money. And there are many ways to be a gentleman.

When a man *chooses* to pay for you, chooses to spoil you, chooses to be nice, don't take that for granted. It was *his choice*. If you're just meeting for the first time, he doesn't owe you anything, except to treat you with respect. And you don't own him anything, except to treat him with respect. So please do.

dating,ufcy28,2022-04-30 15:05:43,Women who refuse to date bi men are insecure and/or homophobic,"I'm a bisexual man and have kept my bisexuality hidden from the majority of women I've dated, partly because I was struggling with self acceptance, but also because most have said they would not date a bisexual man when it's been casually brought up in conversation.

There are two main reasons that most women give when explaining why they wouldn't date a bi guy. The first one is that they believe he will be more likely to cheat, as there are more potential people he will be attracted to. Now, while I see the logic there, this is a fallacy. Cheaters cheat. Sexuality is irrelevant. This is akin to not dating a charming, good looking man just because he has more opportunity to cheat. But the main problem is that it is deeply rooted in the women's own insecurities/trust issues and a belief that she's not enough.

The second reason is that they find the idea of their man being with another man unattractive. Now, while many people would agree that this is just a preference (which we're all entitled to have), my argument is that it is an unhealthy preference, rooted in homophobia. If you are less attracted to a man purely because the idea of him being with another man turns you off, then I can't see how that is anything other than a deep-rooted, innate, subconcious homophobia. Which we have society to thank for!

Apologies if this triggers anyone, but these are my opinions, based on dating a number of women aged 20-30 over the past decade.

Disclaimer: regardless, I think ghosting is a crappy thing to do unless one‚Äôs life was in danger.  But getting ghosted by someone you spent dinner on is just cowardice on their part for not being able to explicitly say they‚Äôre not into seeing you anymore.

Let me give you my perspective.

I am a below-average-looking guy. Not special in any way, studying computer science which isn't quite as attractive as medicine. Still, I'm doing just fine when it comes to dating. Obviously, I can't just go out with everyone I like and it does take more effort than for others but I'm doing really fine nonetheless.

There's nothing wrong with your virginity, but do you not see the problem you have and yet most men like you are male feminists and are mostly virgins?

There's nothing wrong about being a feminist either, but I've never seen many sane & confident MALE feminists. Or that's at least what I've experienced.

Oh, and so about the men shaming.. I've literally seen upvoted comments like ""older men approaching younger women is harassment"". 

Like wtf? Yes, most younger women won't go for an older man. But those men know that every once in a while they're going to find one that will luckily suck them off, hence why they keep approaching.

I'm in my early 20s and I have few female friends who love older dudes. The thing is, they don't like your average older dude. They want a better looking than the average older dude, which is fine. 

But just saying, shaming older men for trying to go for young women is just silly and you probably have some problem with yourself. Maybe not even those oldies want you. 

Besides, I never see people complaining about cougars hunting down younger men. 

You can pretty much ask any fit and attractive male that goes to gym about their experience with being approached by older women while they are busy with their fucking workouts.

And yet none of them feels offended, harassed nor do they want to call the cops lmao, even if they reject those women constantly.

I have only slept with 5 people - 4 being boyfriends - it‚Äôs not as if I have a huge sexual past. 

But I find little things funny and have shared it with him without thinking sometimes.

That's not what a relationship is about. You should be asking what relationship you want. (Aka, a rich man who wants a cute body to have sex with and company has a sugar baby. He has money, she is cute. That's what they each bring to the table for what they are both looking for.) But if you're talking about a normal relationship, each person should be a complete person before entering a relationship. Relationships are not necessarily transactional and it's not based on gender. I expect my spouse to be able to cook. Not because she's a woman, but because that's a human skill everyone needs to know (or at least open to cooking and being self sufficient to cook when she wants).  Relationships are for companionship and getting along with your best friend. Not you summing up someone's transactional worth because you feel you're so great. 
If you want a person whose educated, because you are. That's fine. 
But if you're thinking because you have some big job and abs, you think a woman needs to bring something to ""earn the privilege"" for you sharing your abs and hot shot job, then please don't get into a genuine relationship, that isn't strictly transactional for a reason (aka, sugar baby).

dating,yxx92o,2022-11-17 18:15:14,Tired of guys making the dates feel platonic,"Hi all! I've been on so many dates and I noticed one behavior, I just want to share my observations and to vent...

It seems some guys just don't try to set the mood for a date. They talk but they don't  try to get to know me as a person or reveal themselves more and build a connection. Then, they go out with other girls or just get disappointed and quit thinking ""this online dating thing doesn't work/ I felt no spark "". Ok, probably there wasn't much chemistry between me and those guys in the first place. But do they expect to meet a person and magically feel the sparks without putting any effort into it? I assume some guys will be immediately not attracted to me, which is fine, but I try to look pretty and friendly, so I hope it's not so often. I know we both should do our share in trying to build a connection. I could sometimes do more but I am a bit old school and prefer men to take the lead. I am also a bit quirky and lack confidence when dating but still I had a handful of guys interested in me and had deeper, interesting conversations with them. Also, not every guy is charming enough to make me push myself and  pretend to be a talk show host. Actually some of those guys who exhibit this behavior seem more like a nerdy type.

My most recent date frustrated me - we had 5 dates, all initiated by him so I was excited that he might like me. But there was no progress in our dating and I finally texted him ""this is not going anywhere"" to which he agreed saying it was fun although our conversations were not so great. On the last couple of dates I was thinking of things to ask him, mostly relating to relationships, and tried to find the right moment to ask them, but barely managed because they felt awkward in the existing conversation. And what did he ask me? He asked a lot about my work, my career aspirations, about the software we use at work, about my health insurance at work, comparing it to his own, even commented ""Your company pays well, doesn't it""? He talked about the apartments, buildings, about the neighborhood we both live in. Not a single time did he ask about my values, my relationship history and expectations, personality type, things that make me happy. He was polite but didn't tell me a single compliment or tried to hold hands or kiss. He got to know me on a quite superficial level, asking about the foods I like or things I do in my free time which is ok for a 1st date but not enough for a 5th. Honestly I was annoyed with him talking about work and money so perhaps I dodged a bullet here, which is a shame because he seemed like an attractive guy otherwise. 

Another guy I met once, he was a PhD, smart but probably not experienced in relationships. He just kept talking about his studies abroad, what the people abroad and the work in university were like. Closest he got to know me was asking about my hobbies.  Yes, it might be interesting to hear your stories, but we are just strangers after all.  And yet another guy, he wasn't really attractive, we just had a walk, no coffee or nice places, but he seemed like a decent, smart person, I just didn't feel like he cared. I wouldn't have been surprised if his friends told him to try Tinder and he was like ""ok, I'll try...wait, do I even need a girlfriend""?

Honestly, I have read on Reddit that some people consider a date ending with a kiss a successful one, well those dates of mine could not even come close to that....So how do you people make it? Do I just happen to meet too many guys with no chemistry? Whenever I'm interested in someone I google ""questions to ask during the date"" but they come off as random and forced...

**TL;DR:** some guys talk about impersonal things like work, money or other people without asking questions to get to know me as a person or giving me a chance to ask such questions and the dates feel more like a coffee break with a colleague rather than dates. Sometimes I rely too much on them leading the conversation or pursuing me and there is no attraction built, I get bored and no wonder we never talk and meet anymore. I want to meet fun guys but don't want to end up with those who are very flirty but are actually players.",">I could sometimes do more

Can't complain if you're not doing enough.  


>Not a single time did he ask about my values, my relationship history and expectations, personality type, things that make me happy. He was polite but didn't tell me a single compliment or tried to hold hands or kiss. 

Did you try any of these things yourself? Or tell him that's what you'd like to do/talk about?"
dating,vps6nk,2022-07-02 13:47:37,Are men scared of dating?,"I‚Äôm a 38f and I‚Äôve been single 3 and a half years.  I‚Äôm not interested in getting into a serious relationship as my life is just too hectic already.  I get two weekends a month without my kids and in this time I need to fit in time with friends, time for me, and time to date, no relationship can develop in that sorry of time constraint so it‚Äôs pointless trying.

However, I‚Äôm still human.  I‚Äôm attractive, I don‚Äôt look my age, and I‚Äôm on dating apps to look for a FWB situation really. I‚Äôm honest, upfront about what I want? and I have good chat.  So I match, chat, explain the situation, and usually will decide a day to meet up for a drink when I‚Äôm free so we can take it from there.  Sounds easy right? I mean a lot of men would LOVE this right? A woman who wants sex with no commitment.

And yet, we will chat at most two weeks (depends when we matched as I usually arrange something for my next free weekend), then as the day gets closer, the chat gets quieter, they end up ghosting or cancelling last minute.  One actually told me ‚ÄòI‚Äôve lost my nerve‚Äô because he got a spot on his chin ü´§

You‚Äôre no doubt all going to come at me for being a woman and *shock horror* liking sex, or no doubt will tell me it‚Äôs my fault blah blah blah, and it‚Äôs the men I keep choosing (I actually don‚Äôt have a type tbh, you could t predict who I will match with next) but this happens all the time to my single friends too!

dating,ncr2ag,2021-05-15 04:51:20,Convinced a fat girl she was hot so I could get laid- things backfired,"So I am 22M and a few weeks ago I started using Tinder to hook up with girls just to get laid. I was a virgin at the time and my goal was to get laid at least once since I was getting older. Luckily for me, I scored a ton of times in the course of 2 weeks.

So here is the infamous formula I invented that gave me a 85% win rate with getting laid:

Step 1: 
(the hardest/longest step)

Dm them some bs about how pretty they are. Ask what‚Äôs their favorite movie and then look up ‚Äúbest movie summary for [that movie]‚Äù

Reply to them and say ‚Äúwow that‚Äôs my favorite movie too, because [sophisticated and intellectual reason why I like the movie based upon that googled summary].‚Äù

I‚Äôd then ask ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs your Astro sign‚Äù

Whatever their reply was I‚Äôd say ‚Äúohhh nice, that specific zodiac means you must be fun to watch movies with‚Äù -sounds stupid but it works (for me at least)

I‚Äôd then weasel my way into convincing them to watch a movie together and then arrange a time that they‚Äôd come over.

Step 2: 
When they arrived at my place I‚Äôd bring them into my living room and I‚Äôd ask them a ton of questions about fun things they‚Äôve done (travel, parties, sports, etc)

Step 3:
After about 10 minutes of chatting I ask if they wanted to ‚Äúrelax and watch a movie?‚Äù Most times they‚Äôd say ‚Äúyes‚Äù. (Since that‚Äôs why they were coming over originally)

Step 4:
I‚Äôd then say ‚Äúoh the TV is in my bedroom, if you don‚Äôt want to watch it in my bed I can try moving the TV into the living room?‚Äù, and almost every time they‚Äôd say it‚Äôs fine. (This was the whole purpose of the tv in the bedroom)-so I could pose that question

Step 5: I‚Äôd say ‚Äúone sec I‚Äôm gonna grab a bottle of water real quick, you can head to the bedroom, it‚Äôs down the hall‚Äù. 
So while they started heading towards my room ‚ÄùI‚Äôd turn the thermostat down so it was extremely cold. -this will be important later

Step 6:
Once we‚Äôre both sitting on the bed I put on the movie and we start watching.

Step 7:
I wait for the expected ‚ÄúWOW it‚Äôs cold‚Äù, of which I‚Äôd lie and tell them ‚Äúthe thermostat is broken and the temperature keeps changing but if you‚Äôre fine cuddling we can become a lot warmer.‚Äù

I guess all of them were expecting sex or something because they‚Äôd always say yes and then as we started snuggling we‚Äôd slowly start making out. And about 10-20 mins in we‚Äôd end up fucking..

Anyways, one of the girls who I brought over during that time was a chubby girl. After getting to step 7 we started making out and then she pulled away and asked ‚Äúam I only here because you want to kiss me or are you actually interested in me?‚Äù

Me, the asshole I was at the time, made some bs up and convinced her she was extremely smart and funny and that ‚Äúit was the sole reason I wanted her to come over‚Äù. I also went further and said that ‚Äúthe reason we were getting passionate was because of how pretty and attractive she was‚Äù. 

That statement led to me fucking her. 

After she left for the night she would text me non-stop asking if she could come over again because ‚Äúnobody has ever made her feel special before like I did‚Äù and ‚Äúshe is deadly in love with me especially after what I said‚Äù

Fuck...

So I‚Äôd always lie and tell her ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so busy this week‚Äù or ‚Äúmy job is making me work extra hours‚Äù or some bs like that. 

‚Äî-

I‚Äôm pretty bad at explaining things so hopefully this entire thing made sense. For those who aren‚Äôt appalled or disgusted with me I need some advice of how to tell her no without hurting her. 

For those who genuinely hate me for this and think I‚Äôm an piece of shit, rest assured because karma already caught up with me! -every girl I scored with ended up ghosting me, I guess I‚Äôm bad at sex or something lol 

But anyways that disgusting 2 weeks of my life is over and the experience I had made me realize that I was seeing women through a misogynistic lens hence why I stopped trying to get laid once a day and am now trying to become a better person. Please help with this specific person though. I don‚Äôt want to play with people‚Äôs emotions to this scale and this one may be fragile.

Is this the result of recent feminist movements convincing women that men are out to use and abuse them? It's getting frustrating. I think at least 40-50% of women I ask out act so childish and defensive over it, even though I took the courtesy of asking very politely/privately.

Honestly, there's nothing more attractive or admirable than a woman who rejects you maturely and continues to treat you like.a human being afterwards.",Probably women who get asked out by creeps too many times. Sometimes if they reject it nicely the guys won't get it. So the girls think a bit of aggression is required to let them know they're really not interested.
dating,eworrw,2020-01-31 13:53:25,People give guys bad dating advice.,"So, one thing that definitely needs to stop? The bad dating advice for men.

A lot of the things you will hear as a man are NOT dating advice:

\-Dress with good clothes

\-Hygiene

\-Be a better person. (This is actually the worst advice here, and I will explain later.)

None of this is dating advice, this is how to be a generally good person.

Three things people automatically think they are good at.

\-Sex

\-Fighting

\-Being a good person.

Funny thing is, most people aren't good at ANY of those things.

At the risk of breaking the rule on the general board, this needs to be said:

Disclaimer : I am not nor will I ever be affiliated with black pill / incel/ hate groups that see women as subhuman. Those groups do not represent my brand of evil, any accusations of me being with those groups will be met with blocking and or a remark that will probably hurt your ego for a few days  and then you will get over it, but then get triggered and remember it a few weeks later as it fades into your consciousness.

People see men as predators, and try to re-define sexual assault and rape around this idea they see the idea of logistics : Taking a girl to a bar that you know is in no way sexual assault. Getting her to come to your place for a drink is in no way sexual assault.

Now, is she drunk? Are you drunk? If you're both a little tipsy then all is fair, but this idea that men need to be given advice on how to be ""better people"" instead of actual dating advice is silly.

Most people are not good people, most people are assholes. This applies to women as well. So, why would you assume that guys need to become ""better people"" when the other half is not becoming better? 

Another thing? Becoming a better person actually turns girls off. A friend of mine has a dating problem : He gets numbers, he gets kisses, but girls seem to just run away from him when he makes a mistake. He's not a bad guy, not creepy, not rude, mean and he isn't doing anything wrong by any metric. The thing is, he's a good looking 6""2 black man and he works out every day. (No seriously. . . I don't know how he does it.) From a woman's perspective, either he is a pua who is going to break their hearts or he is going to go berserk and kill them.

Not to mention, he's not the first good guy to have a problem dating girls. If you go through good man syndrome, you're going to have trouble getting girls because they will feel insecure around you. 

Which is why urging a man to become a better person before he dates is awful. 

It's just going to ensure he doesn't get a date.

We're here to date and or fuck, people. We don't need to be pseudo-life coaches. 

Here is some legit dating advice for a guy :

\-Learn body language to see if she is into you or not.

\-Learn how to manage your emotions so null text replies don't bother you.

\-Approach more girls.

\-Make your approach fit to your personality

\-Don't be a nuisance.

\-Learn to take no for an answer.

\-Roll your sleeves up.

\-Know how to deal with her tests

\-Wear grey sweatpants.

\-Be the leader in the interaction, because most girls are still traditional.

\-do not lower your standards, EVER. That will only make her lose respect for you and end up boosting her ego at your expense.

\-Pay attention to how your torso feels when you have been around her. If it's good, then you are experiencing ""good vibrations"" but if its bad and making you feel anxious, you are experiencing ""bad vibrations"" and know she isn't into you and its time to go.

\-You don't HAVE to ask every girl you find attractive out, there is a way through an obstacle, and a way around. Are you the strongest, sexiest, and smartest version of yourself? No? Then feel free to just leave.

\-Recognize when you are burnt out.

Dating. Is. Hard. It is harder than Dark Souls, it is harder than gaming and you are either winning or you're not. If you're not winning and you're tired of not winning, take a break. We don't need less stress in our lives, we need superior rest. This principle applies to all things.

Alright, great talk.

You're welcome.",What the fuck did I just read
dating,dud9au,2019-11-10 16:04:55,Why are men held to far higher standards in online dating and dating in general?,"I've noticed that men get held to far higher standards than women in all forms of dating. Some examples of this are as follows:

&#x200B;

\- men must use great pictures in their dating profiles. Great quality, great lighting, great backdrop, showing them doing interesting things, some photos with people (to show they're sociable), preferably with animals to show they can care for something. Women can use any low quality, poorly taken photo and no one is bothered. They still get dates.

\- men have to work out and be in shape. Being fat or skinny as a man is a virtual death sentence in the dating world. Women can be any size, any shape, don't even need to exercise or have a gym membership, they can get dates.

\- men must have great fashion sense. They must dress really well, with perfect fit clothes in the correct colours. And they must be well groomed. Women can wear anything they want, they still get dates.

\- men must be in a job or studying. They must be earning money or at least working towards something. Women can be unemployed, no ambition and eat pizza all day and still get dates.

\- men must have their own place. Living with parents is a disaster (trust me, I admitted this to women before in the past and they stopped talking to me soon after). Women can live with parents and still get dates.

\- men must have a plethora of interesting hobbies they do. I've been told I must have interesting hobbies like sky diving, rock climbing, sailing, hiking, writing novels, making films etc. all just to get dates with a few women. Meanwhile women can do nothing and still get dates.

\- men must have a great ""attitude"". They must be extremely positive, not in any way bitter or jaded or negative. If they fail to get dates, it must be their poor ""attitude"" that stops them. Women can have any attitude they desire, they can treat men as badly as they want, and they still get dates.

&#x200B;

I can go on. I'm sure I've missed out some things. Why are men held to these high standards, but women can get away with doing so little?","Ah take a deep breath and stop being lazy about shit. It‚Äôs nature man just with technology now

You ain‚Äôt gotta be all that and a bag of chips. Just the bag of chips."
dating,131fija,2023-04-28 02:49:12,Why do guys text me like I am their girlfriend already?,"I am currently dating around and I‚Äôve noticed that guys I text will update me throughout their day like I am their girlfriend.

For example, they update me that they got to work, left work, or are going to text me after something their doing.

For example, ‚Äúi am still at work, ill respond to you in a bit‚Äù or they send me good morning texts every day!!!

I personally don‚Äôt care to get these updates because we are simply talking as friends right now and getting to know each other. I can go days or weeks without speaking its fine with me.

Lets keep it real, we are adults and if I don‚Äôt get responses for a few hours, I don‚Äôt even care. I have even made it clear they don‚Äôt need to apologize for lagging because we are busy and adults ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.

Yea it feels nice for them to be attentive but I don‚Äôt feel flattered since I hardly know them üòÜ

Why do guys do this?","This happens to me too! If I were to make a guess based on some of the commons qualities the guys this is happened with have... most are just a little lonely being single and they miss having someone to talk to about their day. It's a type of closeness and intimacy IMO that some people miss and need outside of relationships more than others. They might just find you easy to talk to and nice company to have as they're going about their day. But if it's annoying for you, set the boundaries you need to."
dating,12xn99e,2023-04-24 15:57:41,is this a form of rape? what is this called and am i at fault??,"so a situation happened to me months ago but i cant stop thinking about it bc idk why it happened and what it would be considered. so i (23F) was receiving a back massage from a fwb (23M) bc who doesn't love a free back massage. well he quickly got horny (which annoyed me bc i didnt wanna do anything sexual at all and i realized the back massage was probably just a segue for him into sex which made me sad bc i thought he was just being nice but that's besides the point). he started touching my butt and things which i didnt mind but then he started grinding against me and i let him know i didnt want to do anything and he was find with that. but i let him do whatever, i was just on my phone. eventually he had put a penetrative sex toy in between my legs, basically in my crotch and he was fucking it and i realized that i really hated what was happening. i felt like i was being used. and the whole time this was going on i was literally just laying there on my tummy on my phone paying 0 attention to what was going on bc i wasnt in the mood at all. and i felt used and gross and dirty even tho he didnt technically do anything to me/with me. 

and part of my issue is that i didnt leave. i couldve just gotten up and left but i didnt, i think i just shut down or something. or i think part of me wouldve felt bad leaving bc i felt like my being there was helping him get off and maybe im too nice of a person. which sounds insane, i know. but why didnt i leave. am i at fault for not leaving. did anything bad or wrong actually happen here?? im just kind of confused by the whole thing i guess

EDIT: some people are arguing about the definition of rape vs sexual assault so I wanted to add my own thoughts. personally I do not think this was rape. I think when I was typing this out I used rape as an umbrella term, as I also said ""a form of rape"". my apologies for throwing around the word, as it can be dangerous to misuse it and overuse it. and thank you everybody for your comments and responses, I appreciate it","Women use the word rape freely these days without understanding what it means. No, it‚Äôs not rape. I think you‚Äôre just in your feelings about the reality of y‚Äôall relationship. FWD means friends with sex. 

He gave you a back massage to put you in the mood, and even tho what he did was weird, he did not force you to participate. You said, ‚Äú I didn‚Äôt want to do anything, but I let him do whatever because I was on my phone.‚Äù  

The definition of rape is ‚Äúunlawful sexual activity and usually sexual intercourse carried out forcibly or under threat of injury against a person's will or with a person who is beneath a certain age or incapable of valid consent because of mental illness, mental deficiency, intoxication, unconsciousness, or deception.‚Äù

So no, you weren‚Äôt raped. You put up with an uncomfortable and weird situation. It also seems like fWb may not be what you want or need. You may want a serious relationship and connection with someone, which is probably why you got mad when you realized the massage wasn‚Äôt free. 

Step back and work on yourself to find out how you feel, but be very careful with playing the victim card. Rape is a very serious thing that can ruin a man‚Äôs life. So when you use that word, make sure you understand the gravity and seriousness of it. Don‚Äôt just use it to describe an uncomfortable situation."
dating,11oj176,2023-03-11 12:30:31,Online dating‚Ä¶ is it worth getting into?,"Hi everyone. I‚Äôm newly single and after spending a few months alone, I‚Äôve decided to explore online dating. I‚Äôve online dated before but that was almost 3 years ago. 

Is it worth it. I know when I did it, it was very hit and miss since most of the guys there wanted to hook up casually which is not my thing.

Thanks!","Your experiences will vary. My take on it is that it‚Äôs like the lotto. You have to be in it to win it. Hopping on dating apps is just a means of expanding the pool of potential dates you‚Äôd go on and also people you‚Äôd meet. For anyone working a busy job (I do a 8-6 but am on call 24/7), it‚Äôs convenient. You just hop on whatever app, swipe or reply to prompts and away you go. 

On dating apps, your profile is subjective too. Pictures matter, quality prompts matter. But it won‚Äôt please everyone‚Äôs eye. Point is, don‚Äôt invest too much time onto the apps. Have it there, spend an hour each week (not each day) on them. But don‚Äôt beat yourself up if you don‚Äôt match with someone you really like. It happens, move on.

And I guess the biggest advice I have for anyone about to get on the apps is to not get too invested too soon. Go on a few dates, build that connection and let things organically grow. Match the energy and slowly bring it up. 

Oh and as a bonus - please communicate. We‚Äôre all adults. We‚Äôre all on the apps for reasons known to us. Don‚Äôt waste people‚Äôs time. If you go on a date and don‚Äôt like them, say so politely and move on. The dating scene sucks enough as it is with the big hook up culture. No need to add to it if you‚Äôre genuinely after a relationship (but also don‚Äôt place so much emphasis on getting one out of the apps, just go meet people and see if they align with what you‚Äôre looking for)"
dating,11e6eg4,2023-02-28 13:45:04,"How should I go about having the ""dealbreakers"" discussion?","I know I shouldn't talk about them too soon, but eventually these things need to be discussed. What I've worried about is: stating my dealbreaker(s), and then a girl realizes she violates the dealbreaker(s), and then she nopes out. That's happened twice already, and those two times it's been roughly on the second date. I don't even think I was being too harsh. Example: I was getting hot and heavy with a girl and I noticed she let me touch her anywhere, but she wouldn't touch me below the belt. This had already happened on 3 separate occasions with her. When I asked her why, she said she doesn't really feel comfortable touching or performing oral on a guy in general. And then I looked at her and said ""okay that's not cool, if a girl can't do that then it's probably not going to work"". She then put on her coat and started to leave. My best friend accused me of being ""unflexible"", and I get that but... isn't it *also* important to stand your ground and be true to yourself? 
How do YOU personally address dealbreakers (delivery and timeline)?","There are soft dealbreakers (not important unless everything else is cool) and hard dealbreakers (very important). If you love oral and can't imagine being in a relationship with anyone who doesn't do it, it's a hard dealbreaker and worth sticking to your guns for. If you can live with out, making a big deal out of it is a bit eh in my opinion. Personally, I do have hard ones and usually talk about them as soon as possible - no point wasting anyone's time."

I don‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs in it for them to say this because it 100% kills the possibility of a purely physical relationship or a relationship that could go somewhere immediately.

And if they want to just have sex, why don‚Äôt they just say that without the ‚Äúbut things might develop later‚Äù bit? 

Also of course it‚Äôs unclear whether things would be serious after the first or second date (this requires longer term understanding of each other) - why do they feel the need say it at that earlier stage?",Because they want to keep having sex casually without disappointing you too much.

dating,x176hw,2022-08-30 02:27:00,Is there anything wrong with rejecting overweight people?,"Imo it's fine to reject people on the basis of weight, it doesn't make you shallow or a bad person. It's wrong to reject people based off skin color, race, eye color, hair color etc. because those are not things a person can control and those kinds of differences should be celebrated.

But everyone can control their weight and stay in shape if they want to. Don't get me wrong, not everybody has the genetics to obtain a six-pack no matter how much they work out in a healthy way. But everybody can at least remain slim and fit with enough effort, it all comes down to calorie intake and exercise. No one is above the laws of physics. And in shape people are objectively more attractive, it's just biology. 

At the end of the day, being overweight is unhealthy, limits what you can do and can lead to all sorts of complications as you get older. So it's fine to have standards and not want someone like that in your life especially when it's something they can easily fix.","I'm overweight and I don't really find anything wrong with it. As long as people don't make assumptions that I'm lazy or anything, it's fine. But, don't assume just cause someone is fat that they're not going to the gym, trying to eat healthier, etc. That would be my main thing."

dating,p1kqro,2021-08-10 07:58:46,"Women I date all seem to fall quickly in love with me. My female friends (32F, 34F & 33F) have told me it's because I'm one of the few naturally good guys out there. This isn't a bad thing by any means, but I just want some casual relationships and I'm breaking these women's hearts too often now.","While this sounds like a humble brag, and I guess it is, but it's also becoming a real problem.

Women fall in love with me easily. Ever since I've been 11, I've often dated the prettiest girls in HS, College etc.

My natural 'goto' game from since then is befriend them, get to know and understand them emotionally. Other than that I show no overt signs of interest, but I do subtly flirt and tease them a lot. I grew up with several girl cousins so conversing and understanding women was easy. I was the youngest boy with 7 similar or slightly older female cousins and I learned quickly how to get them on my side as well as how to really know them.

Whatever I'm doing has worked brilliantly throughout my dating life.

However, I maried my college sweet heart (34F) and at 35m I'm now divorced (2.5 years now). It's no fault of her or me, we just sort of grew apart. My ex-wife is one of my best friends now and she always tells me I'm easy to fall in love with.

I've got 2 other close female friends who I've dated in the past and one I'm FWB. I've known them for over 10 years so we have a very open relationship and understanding.

So back to the topic, for the last 2 years I've been dating and maybe 7 out of 10 women I date, no matter their age, quickly fall in love with me. I so often hear them say they're coming off tinder or bumble because they wanan settle down with me. I don't mind, but unles I'm really inlove with them I feel guilty.

I feel as if they're far more invested emotionally than I am. I end up feeling quite bad like I'm using them and then inevitably I had to break up with them after the first 3-7 dates.

I spent sometime chilling with my guy friends who I haven't seen in months due to the covid (also I moved). And I quickly realize my probelm was quite unique.

All of them had trouble getting 2nd dates, all of them would kill for some of the women I broke up with (they were all very attractive) and they all thought I was some player or stud.

Truthfully, there's not much separating me from them.

I'm well off yes, I make well over $100k, got a nice apartment and car. But many times women don't know that untill long after they're 'inlove'.

I am fairly goodlooking and I have been told i look like Chris Evans a lot. I'm fit, dress well. But there's tonnes of other goodlooking me out there.

So last night I asked my two female best friends what is it that I'm doing 'right'.

They both gave their perpsectives.

Alice said - You're kinda the whole package, and if you slept with them they'd also know you're good in bed. But it's not that, there's something about your tone or your eyes that makes me feel like i trust you. Most guys give off creeper vibes or seem like they're secretly not telling you what they mean because they just wanna sleep with you. What I love about you is that if you don't agree with me, you tell me and do it in the nicest way. You're also funny AF as well because you find humour in most situations. Also, it's cute becauase you're supposed to be the super smart succcessful guy, yet you say the dumbest things sometimes.

Chrissy said - I don't know I can't explain why I like you, I just connect with you more than other men. But it's also because I feel safe with you. I feel like I know what you're thinking. Like you're my safe escape from reality, someone I can be me with.

All good so far doesn't it seem so?

I'd never change this quality about myself, but I kinda want to stop breaking hearts and just keep things casual without having them fall in love with me.

I have this with Chrissy, we are FWB and it's what I need but she lives almost 2 hours away so I don't see her more than once or twice a month.

Any advice on what I should be doing? If I tell women on our first dates that I want to keep it casual does that signal a red flag? I don't want to turn them off obviously, but I don't want to get committed too quickly and then hurt them.

It does feel bad, especially when I don't feel the same.","Are they the same age as you?

A single 35 year old woman who wants kids doesn't really have time to ""keep it casual"".

Hit the gym and date some 20-somethings who just want to have fun."
dating,ndi0gk,2021-05-16 06:14:57,Dating is a guy is exhausting because you have to use fakery and lies even if you don't want to,"I just read a comment on here and it's summed up exactly how I feel but I can't find it at the moment

Basically the guy said that as a man it gets so exhausting because you know you have to not only compete with other men but also put on this act to entertain and perform and provide even if you don't have it and even if you don't want to


The only reason I think I have had so much success so far is because I am 6'6 and conventionally attractive

I am proud of my personality and a lot of women have said that but it does make me wonder if I was short and white and have the same personality if I would have the same success


Something I noticed growing up is specially after hitting puberty was dead other men feel very threatened by me and will try to cut me down and a lot of women would assume I would hit on them.

Looking back it was clear that some of these girls obviously like me but because I was the guy they expected me to perform or impress them in some way and that was never my personality


Contrary to popular belief most men know exactly how most women feel when it comes to dating and that's probably why so many men have it hard because they haven't practiced, and that is because so many women make it clear just how many creeps and monsters they meet


No man wants to be a woman's story about her daily creeper monster and no man wants to be her story about a guy who was pathetic or couldn't keep her going


I honestly do not believe that women or anybody can truly sense someone's levels of social skills or confidence because if that was true then I would have failed so many times but I've gotten by off of charisma and just being socially savvy enough

But it's harder with women because I know how the game is but you do not want to use these type of tactics or be fake when you're trying to form a genuine connection

And get the biggest risk of dating is that you have to be vulnerable and take a leap of faith and sometimes they can leave you with more damage than good


I dated a girl who obviously wanted to have sex but she wanted me to make it happen and it's crazy because she said she wanted to wait

I was completely cool with this and society would judge me negatively if I had any qualms about her reservations but looking back at it, of course socially and verbally she was going to be adverse to sex but because I was the man she wanted me to make it happen because that's the type of man she was attracted to


Everything I was brought up by society and my own family became backward


A lot of women say the dating is dangerous and can be a waste of time because of how many dead in partners that they find but I would argue it's the opposite for men because on our dates we have to act extra careful not to be too overconfident but not to sad or sensitive either and it just gets exhausting because you never know how much you need to be.



I cringe everyday looking back at high school because if I would have stopped acting so politically correct then I probably could have gotten a girlfriend

What society says it's appropriate usually is the opposite when it comes to dating and I wish that was spoken more",I seriously cringe with such posts
dating,n7ix0r,2021-05-08 06:17:10,"Do nice guys exist? And if so, how do I find them?","Ok, so I am a single, 23F. I guess I‚Äôm what you‚Äôd call a ‚Äúnice girl‚Äù. I don‚Äôt drink, I don‚Äôt smoke, I don‚Äôt have casual sex, I‚Äôve never done dr**s, I don‚Äôt swear/curse, I volunteer at an animal shelter, I‚Äôve got a masters degree and I love my friends, pets and family. My hobbies include running, reading and scrapbooking. 

I just finished my degree and am currently working part-time at a bar, while I search for graduate jobs/internships. Working at a bar has made me so depressed and hopeless on the dating front. 

I‚Äôm not exaggerating when I say that 90% of the men I meet are not very nice. I see hundreds of men a day who are cheating on their girlfriends, doing drugs, DUI, acting inappropriately towards me, being perverts and offering me money for s*x! Lots of men harass me verbally and I have even been stalked to my car by a man in the short time that I‚Äôve worked there. Lots of men have also tried to touch me while I‚Äôm serving them drinks. I sometimes go into the bathroom at work and just cry.

The other barmaids say they are just ‚Äúused to it now‚Äù and it‚Äôs just ‚Äúlad culture, so don‚Äôt take it personally.‚Äù But it is scary to me and really unattractive! It‚Äôs really made me believe there are no decent men out there and I feel so hopeless. My ex of 4 years also cheated on me and left me for another girl, which I guess hasn‚Äôt helped my opinion. 

I just want to know, are there any nice guys left out there and if there are, where/how do I find them?

dating,mxg2mt,2021-04-24 08:52:29,Attractive female being forward/blunt,"I liked this guy and I waited for him (2 years) to approach or text or reply to a snap even but he started drinking heavily (on snap) and he started having fake girls on insta (he didn‚Äôt before) and I had to move on. I called him (we don‚Äôt normally talk) and told him how much I liked him, how he was so much better than his drinking, how he was soo smart and way better than the insta girls. He just listened the whole time, barely said a word. Because of his lack of response I deleted him off snap. 

The next day I noticed he changed his insta name (people change their insta names so that people can‚Äôt find them) and removed those girls. 2 months later, I was talking to a friend who knew the story and she said ever since I called him, she never saw him drink again. (She‚Äôs close to the situation/friend group)

he does not want to be my friend (I tried again a few months later). I literally embarrassed myself at how hard I tried. Before you say that a female shouldn‚Äôt chase, I balance bluntness with femininity very well. Men find me attractive and I have a great personality. 

My question is, Why would he even value my opinion enough to change himself but wouldn‚Äôt give me a chance. Not even friends? 

If I was doing something and someone calls me out on it, I would get upset ‚Äúwho do you think you are‚Äù attitude unless I value them. I think that‚Äôs the majority of people‚Äôs psychology. 

Also there‚Äôs a LOT more to the story but this is just a snip. The fact that I found the male version of me is dangerous and this is what caused the intense attraction on my end.","What you did was really mean. Reverse the gender and everyone would be calling you out.

You can't just be going around trying to destroy people.

She might diet or crash diet so next time I see her she could be eating salad instead of donuts, but it would have been horrible for her to experience this.

That what your essentially doing. Alcohol is similar to junk food aswell.

dating,ho5gei,2020-07-09 15:49:45,"My boyfriend seemed like a mature, intelligent guy but he's actually a big man-child.","I met my boyfriend online and in my bio, i wrote that i like mature, intelligent guys. He messaged me, we met up.

When i met him, i saw this guy sitting at a table, wearing a cardigan sweater and slacks, reading War and Peace and drinking some fancy wine, but his eyes weren't moving, just staring at the center. He talked intelligently, like he sounded like he knew what he was talking about, every random question i asked, he knew the answer to. He seemed well versed on political issues, knew the answers to some quiz show i listened to on the radio.

When we got to his house, right by the door was the remote to the stereo, he turned it straight to classical music. His room though, the walls were completely blank. No pictures or anything. But I was thinking i finally found who i was looking for. So...i slept with him. Right away. Afterwards, i hung around for awhile, we watched Jeopardy! and he got most of the question's right. He told me he just reads a lot.

But actually? It seems like an act. The reason the walls were blank was because he took his poster's down, the wall's used to be covered in posters. I know because they were put back up after i left, and i surprise visited him. It was, like, kid's cartoons and anime. I asked about it, he said he's both, a smart guy and a kid at heart. And that he surpressed his childish side because he ""Thought i'd judge him"". But now that we started dating that side came out. He's actually into really childish humor. He thinks Beavis and Butt-Head and Austin Powers are the most hilarious thing ever and kept quoting it at me. He'd greet me with ""What's up, Fart knocker?"" and ""Hey Baby. Do i make you Horny? Randy?"". I cringe laughed at him. Instead of reading War and Peace, he reads manga. Instead of wine, he actually drinks chocolate milk. His closet has one nice shirt and a bunch of graphic t-shirts.

So, i guess the whole mature sophisticated gentleman routine was a front. He's actually a man-child. He basically tricked me, should i continue the relationship or not? Maybe it wasn't just an act. Cause he does seem genuinely intelligent, but was that an act too? I don't really know what to do, actually. Cause i was attracted to the mature intelligent front he put up, but that side doesn't come up much.",You sound so immature.  It‚Äôs hilarious reading your concerns about his maturity when you sound like a junior higher.
dating,fh1nla,2020-03-11 18:18:46,"Be more positive, people (especially men)","I've seen a lot of negativity trolling this board lately.

In short: be more positive.  If you feel bad about the way you look, problem solve.  If you're fat, walk regularly.  Work up toward running.  You can go from being 60lbs overweight to running 3mi a few times a week.  Next, hygiene.  Do you wash your face daily?  Do you use some kind of base body spray?  You can mess around with other stuff like oils (literally I make sure to smell like vanilla).  Do you use product in your hair?  Next, accessories.  I'm pretty simple, but it's not hard to go on Amazon and spend $5 on some bracelets.  Some dudes like rings, some go for chains.  However you dress, it'll attract some different type of person.

Next, build a respectable social life.  It's not hard.  Get involved in activities: exercise, sports, art, adventures, travel, learning, crafting.  If you live outside a city, sad to say but a city offers you a whole lot more.

If you're doing all of that stuff, really I mean it's not as hopeless as I am seeing on Reddit.  I feel so bad dealing with rejection but it seems like (more than a lot of people on Reddit) I bounce back because I do a lot of self-care.  It's not hard for me to look at my dream girl on social media and figure out she's with some guy who doesn't seem as attractive as me or have the same success.  This is about where I'm at in my own journey, but it takes a lot of experimenting.  Learn what you really want.  Be in a position in life where emotionally you want someone to spend your time with hanging out indoors (in bed, on the couch, cooking) or going out with (dinner dates, social groups, staycations, vacations, family holidays).  Be in a position financially where you reasonably work 40 hours a week and don't take work home with you.  Be in a position where you're not planning on making any major work life changes.

For myself, I've been at the dating thing quite a while and I have a rather remarkable set of stories to share about all this work I've put in to my life.  A lot of people get into this mode of oversharing on social media without any real substance.  It seems like many more people get into the throes of life and don't remember to come up for air.  Just remember that when you're ""ready"" you're at the top of your game.  You're at your best for work / your physical self / you know yourself.  There are so many other people who are working through these items or they're unhappy in a relationship.

This is obviously for the people who have it all together and are just missing the spark with the other person.  It's not meant to discourage people still needing to do the self-work.  It's for people who ""know"" they're ""ready"".

For me, I had a few cruddy dates and my exes verbal abuse had floated through my head.  I moved to a city recently and went out a couple of times embarrassing myself.  I had one or two failed starts with what could have turned into something.  These were situations where I put my most positive self forward and it just didn't connect.  Some of this post is a projection for myself that really when you've got your !@#$ together, it's just a matter of not letting others pull you down.. and then it's just a numbers game to keep trying because it will work.

For the guys, I get that the dating apps are totally crummy.  However, if you put effort into showcasing your life through photo's (it's not *that* hard, most phones have great cameras nowadays), you can do quite well on apps.  Most people understand the importance of a good action shot and at least I try to make people laugh and be their best selves when I take a photo of them (even if it's not accurate, people are truly grateful for a good social media moment or captured memory).  Some apps are better than others.  I don't think relying on apps to source your next romance is a great idea, but just like with social media ignoring it likewise doesn't make total sense.  That's just part of being alive nowadays, so even though it could be a lot better we're all sort of stuck ""figuring it out"" for now.

For the guys, just know that five or twenty five women might reject you, give you RBF, or just be outright rude or mean to you.  Only one of those twenty five women matter and that one person wants to talk to you. Grow some thick skin about it, because the apps may have turned people into a commodity but women have always felt this way.. and the rules still are that -- like with a dancefloor -- you effectively do all of the initiating and leading.  Most women these days work, sure, and in that regard a lot of women worth your time will pay their share through the relationship.  Some even may be stuck trying to invent their new world order version of a relationship where the woman leads, but really that simply is not most women.  It's not really that monumentally different from how things used to be.

That's all I got.  Keeping positive is all you can do.  Everyone has bad days or weeks (or years even).  If you're feeling good just do your best to avoid those people and roll with the punches.",[deleted]
dating,epn3xh,2020-01-16 18:11:59,"Guys. Dodge the ""I'm looking for a relationship,"" type like the Matrix.","Why?  **Because they're not looking for any type of relationship with anyone. Friendship or otherwise.** They're looking for attention and will (possibly) reward you with puh puh if you do nice and follow their lead.

**Dating is EXTREMELY easy. You meet.  You click.  You make something happen**. So fuck all the game playing, the PUA advice about being mysterious and aloof.

dating,c9cjha,2019-07-05 06:15:13,Advice. Stop looking and chill boys,"I'm 28 years old and have had quite the ride with women, gents, and I'm finally starting to figure out how great being single actually is. Let me share with you younger dudes what I have learned In the last 12 years of my life, I've seen it all. 


Toxic women. Entitled women. Meaningless hookups. Personality void women. Junkie trash. Gold diggers. Manipulators. Sexually dead women. You name it's I've dated or fucked it.


I know some of you guys having a hard time out there are genuinely looking for someone special to spend your time with. Just a heads up. You're going to be waiting a long time

This is coming from someone who would genuinely love to meet somebody, but is always unsatisfied with his experiences.


I've finally have gotten to the point where I realized sitting back and watching your friends lives get destroyed is a much better place to be. I used to get irritated by how unsatisfying my relationships have been. 


But I got sick of walking on eggshells, and for what? 

Seriously ask yourself that question. What do women today actually have to offer to compliment your life besides just some pussy? What do they actually bring to the table on a emotionally satisfying level? 

Stop chasing and wait til you meet the right one. Stop breaking yourselves for women who aren't worth that much and enjoy the lack of toxicity. Don't be frustrated, you aren't missing out on much. Especially you young guys struggling over there. There is nothing wrong with you. You're just looking for a unicorn in the barn. Live it up and relax.  Being single means you make the rules and do what the hell you want. Chug a beer with your boys and enjoy the game. Don't repress yourselves of your best life",This is complete and utter trash. You cant compare your personal experiences and use them as an example for every other male out there. Did you ever ask yourself why you attracted those sorts of women? Maybe because you sound toxic yourself. I know so many young people who are in secure loving relationships. Some are even married with children. It's not a one size fits all equation. Women have so much more to offer than just pussy.
dating,afd2u9,2019-01-12 23:24:41,[vent] Why do some women date lowlifes?,"I know I'm already get accusations of being a NiceGuy or a misogynist blah blah blah. But I'm really dying to get an answer to this.

It's just something I have a hard time wrapping my mind around. I see a lot of these guys who have nothing going for them.

They're not educated, they speak like idiots, they start fights with other guys, they're like 20-30 and they don't have any future goals. Most just work shitty jobs and have no plans for a future.

Like what box do they check off? If I shoot steroids up my butt and act like loud and obnoxious, will I have the same chances as these guys with women?

Is intelligence, creativity, ambition, maturity all boring now? 

A lot of people might say it's confidence but to me it does not seem like a genuine confidence. Somebody who talks loud/obnoxiously, sags his pants, and starts fights with people is not a genuinely confident person.

I've been lurking through several posts, and I just noticed a negative pattern it seems. People offer superficial suggestions on why they are having issues dating, and I don't understand. 

Men can't be fat, women can't be homely? etc. Fuck off with that. The fuck I was thinking this is 2018 and were past that. Could have fooled me. Smh. 

Never once did I come across someone post two simple words.

> ""Be Yourself.""

Yeah I can conform myself to what I think society wants me to look like, get plastic surgery and become a whole new fucking person if I wanted to. 

But I don't want to do that. I want to be the way god made me, and I hope there is a guy out there for me. Maybe he's even reading this post. Who knows?

But I don't like how superficial people are in this sub. I'm sorry. ","Be yourself is good advice if you are confident and happy with who you are.  Yet, I think most people who struggle with dating are actually struggling with their relationship with themselves.  They don't really like who they are, and have spent a lot of time in escapism rather than building themselves into what they want to be.  Now they are looking for another to fill the void.  This is not the way.  

I can't really speak for the advice on this sub, but I know that ""be yourself"" is not going to work for everyone.  I think a better one liner is ""validate yourself"", but that is confusing to just drop on someone."

I don't even know what I want to do, should I keep dating her, should I dumb her for no reason at all?  If someone has been in a similar situation please tell me how you handle such feelings. Thanks in advance your boi mike","""It turned out she is one of those girls you can't keep using as side chicks"" EW, seriously. I wonder how she would feel if she heard you say that - probably disgusted. Is she just a hole to you? 

This is really disrespectful to refer to anyone like this - honor her as a human being with thoughts and feelings as important as your own, give her full respect and see her as a person, not an accessory or an OBJECT to be used when it's convenient.

There is a huge problem in our culture of people seeing other humans as things or experiences or even programs to experience that are devoid of human feelings. She's a person just like you and deserves thoughtfulness and empathy even if she isn't going to be your girlfriend. Women/people aren't play things or toys for you to put back on the shelf when you're done.

You sound way too immature to be dating anyone.

What's so wrong about having feelings for someone?
If it's scary for you then you're not grown enough emotionally to be doing this with anyone and need to work on yourself.

Seeing someone you're interested in every other week is great to keep things romantic but to also to take it slow. People date long distance for years hundreds if not thousands of miles away.

If you like her genuinely why would you want to fuck it up by dumping her? It sounds like you have a problem with being close with someone and having them see the real you. That's a defense mechanism and you should figure out why. Most of the time it's because deep down you feel like you're going to get rejected or hurt - well buck up BOI you gotta take risks in life or you're gonna end up a lonely and sad person.

dating,lfubzz,2021-02-09 04:15:13,unpopular opinion: don't date if you're struggling mentally,"This may be harsh but if you're struggling mentally (depression, etc), please do not date. Work on yourself and your mental health. It is unfair to the people you date and yourself when your mental health causes problems. I've been ghosted by two guys who said they were struggling with their mental health. The first time it was only a couple dates but I was worried so no big deal, his health comes first. He started ghosting me and i confronted him, at which point he told me. The second guy started ghosting me and I confronted him, no response for a couple days. He finally told me, I replied, and still no reply. Even when you're struggling, ghosting is the worst route to break things off with somebody for you and for them. My own mental health has been shit because i dont know what to think when this happens.

I struggle with depression and anxiety but when I break things off, I always do it with decency and  give them the reason, no games no bullshit. But now I'm just going to assume when a guy says they're struggling with their mental health its just a fake reason and they're too chicken, unless they give me a reason to believe otherwise. Just be straight up and honest.

edit: people just keep making assumptions that im saying people with mental illnesses do not deserve to date/find love. NO. that is not my point, im saying prioritize healing yourself before dating because 1) can't love others if  you don't love yourself 2)it hurts more people. and yeah mental illnesses are unpredictable but you can work to get yourself to a point where you can communicate what you're going through to your loved ones instead of dipping out!!

edit 2: okay obviously everybody and their experiences are different. my point is get yourself to the point where you can communicate with your loved ones instead of acting shitty and disappearing before pursuing others and eventually hurting them. mental health isn't a one size fits all, everybody suffers differently. but like i said this post is my opinion!!!! based from my experiences!!! with my own mental illnesses!!!! and guys who've treated me shitty bc of their illnesses !!! the title is honestly a clickbait in hindsight ","I‚Äôm confused. You say don‚Äôt date if you‚Äôre not in a good place mentally and then go on to admit you yourself struggle with depression and anxiety.

I get where your frustration stems from, but I think you took a wrong turn somewhere. How about this instead? Don‚Äôt use your mental health issues as an excuse to be a crappy person. Period.

So many people struggle with depression and anxiety and a whole plethora of mental health issues but lead completely functioning lives in which they don‚Äôt treat others like garbage. 

Also, the whole you can‚Äôt love others until you love yourself bit is kinda BS. Plenty of people have self esteem issues and still love with all their heart quite well. 

Again, I get why you‚Äôre frustrated, but ghosting isn‚Äôt a consequence of depression or mental health issues. It‚Äôs a consequence of current day dating an dudes who just aren‚Äôt that emotionally invested in you treating you in a crappy way."

One of my friends suggested Farmers Only and I realized that actually might be a good idea.

I downloaded it and ended up meeting a man (41M) in the area I would be primarily working in for the next few months.  Since I was still a couple weeks from my first trip, I kept it online and fun.

I was actually surprised at how well we got along despite our different backgrounds, and found myself looking forward to his photos of his massive farm, his daily shenanigans, and his work.  He is also really funny, pretty hot and handsome, and was pretty honest about his life.

The ONLY thing that stood out to me was the potential political differences.  Based on comments made or stories he told (and a little stereotyping), I could tell he was Republican or Libertarian.  Which was fine, for me, as that isn‚Äôt unheard of in small town America and I am pretty politically open.

But after we had multiple dates in-person, and talked for weeks non-stop the topic of guns came up and how I had never held a gun.  He jokingly wondered why and then offered to show me. I didn‚Äôt want to dance around the topic,  I really liked him, so I took the plunge and shared that I was pretty liberal. No commentary on any issues, political elections, historical things, I current issues.  I just shared that I fell more liberal on the spectrum. He looked somewhat surprised.

Now, I have NEVER hidden anything from him.  He knew I came from a big city, what my background was, education, job, interests, and my opinions on other social topics, etc. We had just never explicitly talked politics.

When I told him he looked surprised, he laughed and said no, and that he had his suspicions. But that he was surprised that I knew so much about ‚Äúhis world‚Äù and had a ‚Äúcountry feel‚Äù to me.  That made me happy to hear and we wrapped up our date and went home.

But, then nothing.  He usually texts me something before bed, and then in the middle of the night (aka when he wakes up for work), and then sends me photos of daily happenings.  And they all just‚Ä¶ petered out.  

I am really, really sad, because I *really*  liked him and I thought he really liked me.

Eventually, I did ask him directly if something was wrong, and even point blank asked if it was our political conversation, and he has denied it and said he has just been busy during the day and really tired at night.  And he hasn‚Äôt been unkind or mean in his responses whatsoever.

But, we haven‚Äôt been together in a few days (which is unusual) and have since talked less than we would talk in a single morning.  I don‚Äôt want to push, because he could really be overworked and really tired and I certainly don‚Äôt want to smother him. But I think it really was the politics thing.

And so, now I‚Äôm at a loss of what to do.  I don‚Äôt want to keep pestering him (if that‚Äôs what my check-ins and cute texts are now), but I also don‚Äôt want to assume that we‚Äôre done (because dating in this small of a county would be awkward). I also don‚Äôt want to be the one to an introduce a ‚Äúclosure‚Äù conversation, because I ultimately do not want that.

Also, is this a lesson moving forward?  Should I hide my political beliefs if I continue dating like this? I have no ill will or judgement on anyone else or their political beliefs, but I don‚Äôt want to hide who I am to these wonderful men I do meet.

Any help or feedback (especially if you‚Äôre dating in rural America), would be appreciated!","If him finding out you lean left caused him to pull back, it was going to happen eventually."

At 20, I never felt insecure about my virginity but quickly found out that people judged me harshly for it, made fun of me, and guys got creepy about it. So I lied and said to my now boyfriend at the start that I wasn't a virgin and lost it at 17. I never made any other story about it, just said I lost it at 17 to 'a guy,' it would be weird/messed up to add any more detail.

The thing is, our relationship started off casual so I never felt the need to tell him, but now we're in a relationship I don't want to start it off on a lie. However, I don't feel comfortable telling him (at least not yet) because I'm afraid of the judgement, plus he consistently calls me 'adorable,' and 'innocent.' He means no harm by it, but I also always feel like a little girl with him, and it's only going to get worse when I tell him. Should I just come clean? :/","Come clean.

dating,zu3ai2,2022-12-24 06:03:34,Is it wrong to call off a relationship due to gap in sexual experience?,"TLDR; Would I be in the wrong for ending a relationship very early on because he‚Äôs inexperienced sexually?

I (23F) have been seeing someone (21M) for about a month now, though we‚Äôve been familiar with each other for several months. We haven‚Äôt had the labeling conversation yet and it‚Äôs still very early on, but he‚Äôs introduced me to his friends and we talk pretty regularly. I think he really likes me and I like him. He‚Äôs by far the kindest and most considerate person I‚Äôve dated and my ideal long-term partner has so many qualities that I see in him. The only issue so far is his lack of sexual experience. It turns out I was his first kiss, which shocked me because I have been in a couple serious relationships already and have a lot of sexual experience in and out of those relationships. I am very familiar with myself and know what I want with a sexual partner. So this was alarming to me because suddenly I feel like I‚Äôm in a position of power over him, especially because he‚Äôs a little younger, and that I will have to teach him a lot if I want this to keep going. And I‚Äôm also extra nervous about crossing boundaries or accidentally pushing him outside of his comfort zone. I have never called off a relationship so preemptively like this and I‚Äôm afraid I would be doing it for a non-reason, when I should instead be focusing on all the things I like about him. However, if things progressed physically I know that I‚Äôm not comfortable being in such a position of power like that. Would it be wrong for me to call it off so soon when he‚Äôs genuinely done nothing wrong? And if I do, how do I make sure I‚Äôm gentle about it and don‚Äôt accidentally shame him for having a lack of experience?","You can call off a relationship for any reason, if you don‚Äôt want to even try to be in it, then you shouldn‚Äôt. 

But you‚Äôre also doing this based off of an assumption. You can tell him what you want sexually, like that you want to be with someone who is more dominant. And he may surprise you, it might not be as awkward as you‚Äôre expecting it to be. But I think if you like him otherwise, it could be worth finding out instead of assuming the worst will happen. If you try and it isn‚Äôt something you want, then you can end it then too."
dating,zlb9p6,2022-12-13 23:54:17,Met my destiny but friendzoned,"I met a girl who is a psychologist a few days ago and instantly hit it off. It felt like meeting her and being with her is my destiny.

&#x200B;

We flirted a bit over WhatsApp and she enjoyed my compliments. She said her ex made her feel bad about herself. 

I asked her thoughts on marriage and she did marriage is not for her.

&#x200B;

We met a week later and I gave her a red rose. She instantly said - ""You shouldn't have"" and I realized it was a blunder.

Later on, while talking, we found we have so much in common. 

&#x200B;

The next day after we meet, I flirted with her and she kinda enjoyed it. But suddenly there was a change in her tone. When I said I would love to spend my life with her, she said she was commitment-phobic and interested in me just as a friend.

Based on the conversation, a small red flag which I noticed was that her parents were not looking for any suitable groom for her, which is surprising considering she's extremely beautiful and well-educated. She has resigned herself to living as a lonely girl and said her parents considered her their retirement plan. Her younger sister is married and she told me her sister gets all the compliments. 

&#x200B;

The 2 of us have many common interests and qualities. 

&#x200B;

I am really interested in her and would like to grow old with her. What should I do?

&#x200B;

1. Just be with her as a friend for a couple of months and see if she gets to like me? 

2. How long should I try?

3. Furthermore, she said she's commitment-phobic. Would being in a relationship with a commitment-phobic lead to a happy life? I don't know a lot about this phobia.

4. Is she just being an attention seeker for compliments?",You told a girl you want to spend the rest of your life with her after a few days...? Did I read that right?

As long as you‚Äôre honest and work together to make it amazing, open to trying new things, understanding of no‚Äôs and being ok with those lines staying there forever should they come up, etc. Have those talks in detail before hand anyways. Those talks will reveal a lot of sexual compatibility that sex could be a deal breaker or not (aside from the fit). I don‚Äôt blame you, way more fun that way. And ok even if you disagree with that CONSIDER that not all of us are clueless about sex, some of us are very sexual, know what we want, and I mean I‚Äôve waited over 20 years to have sex‚Ä¶ trust me when I tell you it will be worth the wait. Like an animal breaking free from its cage. All that sexual tension released for you. Especially if we build that emotional bond too. Hon I will surprise you.

dating,qqczqr,2021-11-09 20:52:08,Dating app without chatting. Crazy or not?ü§î,"Goal: Have a dating app that promotes real connection over texting and discourages flaking.

Features: 
- No chatting
- After a match decide where and when to meet up by selecting/voting on options, the app then chooses for you based on mutual preferences and sets a date
- Put $1-20 down as flake prevention (you get the money back if you go on the date)
- Confirm on that day that you are still down
- Check-in once you've arrived at the date location to prove you didn't flake. As long as you showed up you get your money back
- Give people a set-date and flake rating (set-date rating shows how likely you are to set a date after matching, flake rating shows how likely you are to actually go on the date)
 - Reward people with high ratings (get shown to more people, can swipe more, ect), maybe let people see your rating
- Must verify profile

I (23M) had my first date with this girl (28F). It was kind of a weird thing, since we decided to have our first date as a weekend in an airbnb. It was great, i really felt that was a good time spent. But here's the thing:

She ended a 10 year relationship with this guy at June, and she says that she wants to be on their own, although she said before the date that she wanted to see if there was a thing between us, the old ""let's see how it goes"". She wants to meet new people, she wants to understand what she wants, she said that for a long time life was always the same to her, and she feels lost.

She said that before me she was dating this other guy, and the way she talked to me she said that they ended things, but left unresolved things to talk about. I found out that yesterday she met him to talk about these unresolved things, and that both of them dont want to end things, although she doenst want anything serious with him.

I really am not confortable with this, but i dont want to loose her, I mean it was just a first date. I understand what she is going through, but I dont think i like it. Am I being ridiculous thinking like that? Should I leave her? Should I stick with it? I am really confused, and i need advice because i don't know what to do.

Some short women under 5'4 have height requirements and it just pisses me off that one of the reasons that short women have height requirements is that they don't want short kids. I'm 5'4 and short women have told me they don't want me to fuck up their kid's height because they think that being short is like some kind of disease. Not only that, but a lot of short women seem to think that guys under 6'0 are inadequate enough for a lot of reasons. Certain short women have this superiority complex about being short and acting like guys love them because they are short while putting tall guys on a pedestal. I get the most shit from short women and women that are usually taller than me are more confident and chill. I feel bad for tall women because they have to put up with this bullshit short women have with bigger guys and it makes sense for them to want a tall guy, but the competition is harder for them and I can't even begin to imagine the amount of times guys wouldn't want tall women because they aren't ""Small and cute"" nonsense.","The OP is a banned troll who creates multiple accounts specifically to hate on short women.

Not looking for anything serious, I thought Tinder would be a good place to find casual contacts. As such, I move fairly quickly to meeting up, and if there is real life attraction, go to his or mine. 


Now, the issue is, somehow I attract people who want to talk about their childhood issues, have my advice on their mental health problems, want me to help talk them through a tough spot at work, usually very quickly into me meeting them. I also find that some men want someone to take care of them, or even worse, start talking about future kids 2-3 dates in (as in how our kids might look like, not kids in general).



I am the common denominator, so what am I doing wrong that I‚Äôm inviting such intimate (in all the ways I‚Äôm not looking for) conversations? How do I keep things casual?

dating,kjebhu,2020-12-24 12:01:32,Why most men are disappointed with their dating life ?,"A world driven by lust and desire , disappointments are common. If you think this post is about me venting out my frustrations due to rejections, you are sorely mistaken. 

EXPECTATIONS , that is your enemy right there. 

Are you the type of guy who would go on dates or befriend a girl? make an attempt to impress her ? perhaps brought her flowers? chocolates? . If you do these, that's great ! But do you expect something in return? Maybe a kiss or something more? Well, she is under no obligation to do anything just because you were nice . 

The sense of entitlement we men have due to the good actions we put out there may not be reciprocated. She does not ask you to do these things for her, you have done that on your accord. Understanding that she has a choice is essential . Understanding that people have their own problems to deal with is important. Do you get frustrated when she does not respond to your texts or you have been constantly trying to make a move for sometime now , doing everything you can , being nice and respectful yet nothing seems to happen ? 

Most women face situations where a man constantly tries his best and when he is rejected or 'ghosted' , abusive and insulting texts begin to flow. Rejections are sad and disappointing BUT you do NOT take it out on her. She has a CHOICE. Everyone gets frustrated but controlling those frustrations is the key to self improvement. 

If you approach a woman, keep an open mind , realize that she does have to do anything or be nice to you. Don't expect anything from her. 

To all fellow men out there , be nice (*this does not mean you gotta buy things for her, being respectful and polite goes a long way*)  and courteous without expectations. 

P.S- 

* You may find grammatical errors , disruptive flow of content or something highly illogical. I wanted to convey this and if you got the essence of the subject , change is coming. 
* Although this may focus on 'man' and 'woman' , i hope it helps all genders and s\*xual orientation. 

&#x200B;

\*- Menon",">Well, she is under no obligation to do anything just because you were nice .

If she is a self-described feminist, she absolutely is under obligation to return the favor. Since they want equality, they should reciprocate.

>The sense of entitlement we men have due to the good actions we put out there may not be reciprocated.

Do you expect your date (man or woman) to be punctual, attentive, and kind? Those are 'entitlements' by definition. Everyone is entitled, it's called having standards.

>Do you get frustrated when she does not respond to your texts or you have been constantly trying to make a move for sometime now , doing everything you can , being nice and respectful yet nothing seems to happen ?

Why, yes, 'frustration' would be a completely rational response to putting in an emotional investment while getting no reply, in your scenario. That's flat out disrespectful.

>She has a CHOICE.

Who said she didn't have a choice? Everyone has choices, including men.

>Don't expect anything from her.

This is flat-out bad advice. You have every right to be given a basic level of respect and courtesy, regardless of your gender. Your White Knighting aside, the Golden Rule still applies: ""Do unto others as they would do unto you""."

Perhaps I was enjoying the drama in my head, the useless, neverending chase of boys who only care about sleeping with me and dumping me afterwards; the high of being used. Is it only me?
I decided to straighten up. I‚Äôm exhausted and will stop entertaining this kind of guys. They are bad in paper and bad in bed (okay, sometimes good too but doesn‚Äôt matter)!","Do you know what's funny? You sound like a long group of women who swear they're done with bad boys. You'll never stop dating them. You'll never stop sleeping with them. They're exactly your type. 

I guess now you're ready for the type of guy that you'd turn down, right?"
dating,g6y5wt,2020-04-24 00:11:26,How To Keep A Man's Interest,"1.) **Pay for something at some point during the date.** It's common for the guy to pay on the first date so it's cool to let him since he likely asked you out but go for dessert somewhere after dinner or even just grab some tea or w.e and pay for the both of you. At some point, by the **second** date, you need to pay for both of you. This gesture, even if you only spent like $5, will go a long way. <-- You should be able to figure out why so I won't elaborate.

2.) **Start initiating contact.** You should not be keeping count of who contacts who first. That's not healthy. Just exercise common sense here. After the first date, this whole chase me game needs to end. You need to contact him as well. Don't blow his phone up tho.

3.) **Tell him you enjoyed the date.** This is self explanatory. Yes, you need to explicitly say this even if you were laughing your ass off the entire date and it was obvious and you think he already knows.

4.) **Waiting 3 days for a kiss doesn't work.** I get the whole sl\*\* shaming thing and the all the BS dating rules that have existed but if you wait too long to kiss the man, he's gonna assume you ain't interested. Unless he's already really into you, which would be unlikely by date 3 for anyone above the age of 24, he's just gonna start talking to other women.

5.) **If you are the super conservative type tho...** if you have some deep rooted conservatism about relationships for w.e reason, then you're gonna need to find other way to let him know you really like him. I.e telling him that you really enjoy spending time with him etc etc. At this point, he's gonna have to decide if he wants to sit and wait 10 years b4 you are finally ok with kissing him. Most guys won't be tho so good luck!

6.) **There is no 6. This is the devil's number.**

7.) **Texting** \- Most questions on reddit are about texting. If you see each other a couple times a week then you need to calm down if he doesn't text you too often. **Are you texting him or always waiting for him to initiate?**

If you don't see each other often, over texting can burn you out. Ideally, you wanna be texting every 2-3 days at the beginning of the relationship. How much you start texting once the two of you are firmly in a relationship may change tho. Some ppl text more but if you've only been on 1-3 dates, texting every day is too much.

\-----

Hopefully this will help all you ""poor unfortunate souls! So sad, so true! This one wants to get the girl, that one wants to get the guy, do I help them? Yes, indeed!"" Now give me my karma.

**I had to sensor any ""bad"" words as the mods of any sub on reddit are so afraid of being accused of sexism or misogyny that they will delete a post and ignore the contexts those words were used in.**","Disagree with the bit where you have to kiss a man within 3 days. If you're not comfortable getting physical that fast then that's perfectly fine and not unreasonable. I mean, why is it ridiculous to not want to kiss someone who's basically a stranger and for whom you don't feel anything for yet?"
dating,fmk15t,2020-03-21 18:55:04,Are men romantic anymore?,"After trying to ask a few men what their romantic dreams are on tinder and being met with mostly silence, I have to wonder - are men romantic anymore? 

Ladies, when's the last time men did something romantic to impress you, build trust, show their depth as a person, show how much they care about how you feel/how they want to know/understand how you feel, turn you on? 

This is the point of romance. To get women interested in trusting and opening up to men (because we face real threats of violence and being used in our relationships. The point of romance is to show us how you'll treat is the furthest from that as possible, and that you can keep it up). 

Guys, when's the last time you did this? Do you believe in romance? Do you understand/accept what it means for some women - building trust and attraction? 

What scenarios is romance happening in - what kind of relationships?

I get the impression that many guys seem to expect women to want sex based only on our sex drive, not when it comes to how they treat us.

 Of course, sometimes you want to get to know a person as friends or casually to even gauge a serious interest - however, many guys act casual and boring about sex, they dont build trust, they just expect to be handed to them without even being arousing or trustworthy.

I'm also detecting a lot of guys just having boring standards for being in a relationship - they just want someone to sleep, eat, and pay the Bill's with, who they can have boring sex with. 

Wheres all the romance at?",Maybe they saw all of your man-hating posts on reddit and decided to save their romance for someone else.
dating,fkvqwm,2020-03-18 19:43:17,"Two word responses don't count, sorry guys","I find that the conventionally attractive guys on dating apps speak in 2-4 words, tops. I'm sure that they have a lot of conversations going on but even if that's true...how is that tolerable?

I tried to talk to this really cute guy and the most words he used were four, **four.** I figured maybe he was at work but, ""lol no."" Uh, okay, bye.

Is it because they know they're attractive and just expect women to fawn all over them, despite their total lack of personality? It's even more odd since their profiles are usually clever, they can obviously use words but choose not to. It's like a way to reel people in and then....nothing. Makes me wonder if they get someone else to write it for them.

To anyone that only responds in hardly fragmented sentences, please don't. It's boring and it's exhausting to try to make any type of connection. And why even bother?

dating,djhp3a,2019-10-18 03:34:20,Women on Tinder and hookups,It really astounds me how all the older women on Tinder who are post-wall are so adamant against hook ups.  Either there are a lot of guys with no standards or women are delusional about how attractive they are.,"There's no such thing as ""the wall."" There is no precipice that women suddenly fall off of. Instead, it's more of a gradual decline.

The only way ""the wall"" could possibly exist the way you think of it is if a woman got into a horrific accident and got disfigured. But that would also apply to men. 

The way I understand it, is that women are always showered in offers of dick. It's rare for them to be offered an emotional connection; a meaning. A lot of them are burned out because of this. This is also why younger women tend to be easier to date: They aren't jaded yet."

Even if the person explicitly states at the beginning that they have a good job, a nice family, a good circle of friends and they work out regularly, the advice is always the same - ""just keep focusing on yourself/keep working on yourself/keep doing you"".

These phrases mean nothing. They are no more than cliched soundbites which don't help anyone and I'm not sure why they get parroted over and over, to the help of absolutely no one.

If I were to give realistic advice which could help people, it would be this:

&#x200B;

For males: looksmax, be charismatic, put yourself in more situations around women

For females: lower your standards to something more realistic and attainable","I disagree that one should lower their standards. If you know what you need in a relationship and a partner, you shouldn't compromise on it. But of course, it's important to distinguish between needs and wants. I think too many ""needs"" are actually wants.

And generally, so called clich√© advice is given because people who vent about not being able to get dates or that women don't like them come across as having self-esteem issues that need to be worked on to have a healthy relationship to begin with."

She said she was impressed by this which gave me hope. We then moved out (no reason bar end of tenancy) but maintained our friendship afterward. I asked her out again after some drinks this time with some flirty comments and then a text when I got home. She friendzoned me again. Even now after that I still occasionally see her and she still wants to see me, she also always asks me about my romantic life. The issue is despite seeing her less my feelings are just as intense, my friends are confused as to why Im showing no interest in girls who show interest in me (I have rejected two girls who made advances and have given up on dating apps). I am just not remotely interested in anyone but her, Im going to continue seeing her and looking for signs in the hope she changes her mind but I have no interest in dating anyone else again.

Yes i know you are all not that way and that isn't what I'm saying. My last 2 major relationships ended in failure.  One was divorce. I don't blame her.  We were both young etc.  The most recent one, I was played for a fool by a woman and it left me broken suicidal and messed up for a year. I was then made fun of by her and her new man for the damage it caused me.  I'm not good now but I'm much better. I haven't had a companion for 2 years and I've been single for 3. I've been on a single date in those 3 years.  It wouldn't have worked.  Major red flags on her end.  I'm an average looking guy.  Not ugly not in perfect shape but not out of shape either.  What am i doing wrong and honestly is it even worth it at this point?","Do you *want* to date? It‚Äôs a little unclear to me from your post. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with wanting to be single but social in groups. If you do want to date, how have you been trying to meet women? The fact that you‚Äôve written off every potential date without meeting them due to ‚Äúred flags‚Äù makes me think that you‚Äôre either looking for women in places where they are unlikely to be compatible with you at all, or your expectations for these women are not realistic, probably due to your past hurt."

I tried dating apps but there seems to be no good person in there that matches my energy. There's one but he's 10 years older, doesn't wanna get married nor have kids. That guy is 38. It's just in one of our conversations he brought that up but we're total opposites in that aspect. Another one is ok to talk to, got plenty of netflix series to discuss but he's like a grumpy kid who wants to be exclusive after 2 days of chatting. Like, really? We haven't even met yet or talked about a lot of things. And the rest just want sexting and sending nudes. So I just eventually deleted cause it just frustrates me more and more.

It's been about a year since I've started working at my job but I've only been having convos with him for the past few months. When the day is slow, I'll visit other departments and socialize, his department happens to be one of them. I'm very quiet and shy but even he admitted recently that I'm starting to open up. Hes not an extremely outgoing guy but he'll talk to you and everyone LOVES talking to him

I'll try to keep this short but since day one he's been invested in my personal life, if im talking/dating a guy. And I've noticed he constantly wants my attention: there were a few times he would joke how I liked talking to one of our other coworkers(whos a female btw) more than him but then one day I teased him by asking if I talked to him enough that day and he said ""yeah you should come down and talk. we should talk some more...I mean why not? Ik I'm not *insert name* but still""

There also seems to be this version of myself that he's created in my head. I'll be talking about how my younger siblings don't get in much trouble as I did when I was their age and he'll say he couldn't see me as a bad kid and that I was a good one who followed rules, not a rebel, etc. Im a good person. He even commented that my parents did a good job raising me. 

My mom says that he doesn't like me because of his age but is probably just lonely and is also slightly jealous that someone isn't giving him attention, which he's probably used to. A part of me believes that because he does strike me as the kind of guy to do that but then there's this other feeling I can't shake. There are times he really holds eye contact with me. Some days i sense a nervousness when hes around me. but I refuse to actually believe he'd be interested in me, esp since he made a comment during a group convo with another coworker that he has no desire to remarry",That‚Äôs a pretty big age gap.

So what happens when you do that, it becomes part of your lifestyle and values, and then you can't date anyone similar since fit/slim women are almost impossible to date?","I've been working out now since I was a teenager which is decades now. I think it's really important. At this stage if I missed a day I would think I screwed up something important. Like I would never go a day without brushing my teeth.

I drink veggie shakes. I weigh myself regularly to track. I mix up cardio and weights. But I just look like a normal regular slim/fit guy. I don't have body builder genetics and I don't use steroids. Working out and eating healthy should hopefully keep my heart strong, my endurance good, my body fat down, and my body as healthy as it can be. But it didn't turn me into a steroided Hollywood movie star like Thor.

So it hasn't really changed anything in terms of my attractiveness to women. And now after so many years of this, I don't relate to anyone who doesn't share the same basic values.

I have tried dating women who overeat and don't exercise and it is no different than when I have tried dating women who smoke. I sit there watching them do their bad habits and it's like I'm watching a slow motion car wreck in my mind. I want to say ""Why are you killing yourself? Put the cigarette/whatever down."" 

But all the slim/fit women I know have always dated men who look nothing like me. They usually date guys who are built like NFL players, guys who are insanely tall, guys with Tom Brady or movie star perfect model faces, and white guys. 

Of course women can date whoever they want, but I don't know what to do. The only women I match to online tend to have nothing in common with me and I don't find them attractive at all. I tried and it doesn't work.

I looked at the stats and apparently in America it's around 90% of adults who are now ""overfat"" (fat enough to impair health which is >17% body fat for men and >32% body fat for women).

I have no idea how to date someone in that last 10%. So far I have only very rarely in my life gotten any interest from someone who is also in that 10%.

dating,pa1jq4,2021-08-23 14:59:49,"There‚Äôs something deeply agonisingly about knowing, because of being average, you can‚Äôt reasonably count on getting a beautiful partner in life.","
Please read fully before commenting, I‚Äôm just playing devils advocate 

I‚Äôm sitting here thinking 

The societal expectation is ‚Äústay within your lane‚Äù, don‚Äôt feel entitled to a supermodel, because supermodels mostly date other supermodels

‚ÄúGet realistic expectations of a partner, and you‚Äôll be happier‚Äù 

Etc etc. 


Just get someone less attractive but with a great personality, and learn to love them for who they are, as we would hope they love us for who we are 


Now, I don‚Äôt feel entitled by any means to a supermodel nor do I particularly want one right now. 

But I wanna play devils advocate and say, don‚Äôt you think there is something deeply disconcerting and despairing about this sense of absolute finality in sex and relationships? 

At least for me, it‚Äôs like a caste system we all just unconsciously accept. Models are the upper cast, then there‚Äôs average, below average castes, etc. We know it‚Äôs probably a good idea to ‚Äúdate in your league‚Äù to avoid disappointment 

I think we all know that the higher the ‚Äúcaste‚Äù of attractiveness you are, the more life opportunities and pleasures present themselves to you. Some superficial, others quite deeply enriching. And as a supermodel ‚Äúcaste‚Äù, it‚Äôs just accepted, and perfectly natural, that sex, dating and relationships with other beautiful people *just happen* organically 




I guess what I‚Äôm trying to say here is that, this unofficial, universally accepted heirarchy of looks disappoints me, and only because I‚Äôm a loser in the heirarchy. Should I ever dream of dating a higher caste, I‚Äôll be screamed down as an entitled pig or all manner of belligerent insult 

To me beauty is a wonderful thing, and to wake up every day knowing that I‚Äôm effectively forbidden since birth from easily accessing the world of beautiful people‚Äôs dating, hurts my soul. 



EDIT: just to emphasise, im not talking about personality, so don‚Äôt try to strawman it in here, I‚Äôm talking specifically about the western culture of ‚Äúlooks league‚Äù, ie, ‚Äúshe‚Äôs outta your league bro‚Äù, ‚Äústay within your lane‚Äù etc, phrases used in popular teen culture for decades, this directly implies an accepted heirarchy of ‚Äúleagues‚Äù, so please don‚Äôt try to argue against it.","Don't you enforce this so called cast system by wanting to date hot models? Normal people also look good. There you should have a chance, or am I missing something? If I don't work out I'm not running after a gym guy. :D Nevertheless, there are unequal couples and it can happen. The other way around, I could not date someone who does not do sports at all."
dating,n7s8ks,2021-05-08 16:00:17,Going undercover as a girl on dating apps,"So I always knew that girls got more matches on average than guys on dating apps in general but I had no idea just how skewed it really was. A few days ago I was curious and wanted to know just what it was really like being a girl on these dating apps. A female friend of mine let me borrow her pictures to use on the profile and I signed up for it. One thing to note is she is kinda cute on a good day but isn't someone who your gonna do a double take if you saw them walking around. I didn't wanna use a girl who looks like a twitch streamer cause then of course I'd get a million matches and it wouldn't be much of an experiment. Also I wanna make clear I didn't respond or talk to anyone during this experiment as well.

What I found was crazy. I signed up for tinder, bumble, and a few other apps. I would swipe left on 5 people and then right on 5 and go back and forth to have a good sample size. All of them came up with the same results. I started this experiment on Wednesday and it's now Saturday and in four days I got more matches as a girl than I did in years as a guy. I was honestly shocked just how many matches I got when swiping. It did explain a lot however. It explained why I never got anywhere with these apps. A girl can just pick the best looking guy out of the laundry list of people hitting them up. To get any kind of success on these apps as a guy you have to be about in the top 15%. I wouldn't call myself ugly but I'm not even close to being in the top 15% of guys. A lot of the guys that on there are super ripped versus me who naturally has a skinny body type and no matter how much I lift I cannot gain any muscle. How am I supposed to compete with these guys and why would a girl chose me when there are 10 better looking guys hitting her up? That's just one example and I know not all girls are into muscle guys but whatever a girl is looking for she is going to have so many different options to choose from what are the odds she chooses you? Like I said earlier I knew that dating apps were skewed but I had no clue it was this bad.

With this knowledge I can honestly say that dating apps has ruined dating for the majority of guys. Cause even if your not all that attractive as a girl you could go on any apps and have at least 50 people hitting you up after a week. Some of these girls end up developing a superiority complex because if they aren't attractive and they never really got a whole lot of attention from guys their whole life and then bam they sign up for these apps and now all of a sudden she has multiple guys a day who are down bad telling her she is an angel sent from heaven. She's never gonna care about you in specific cause she can just go online after your guy's date and have 10 better looking guys teller her how pretty she is on her apps. The only way now I feel like I could find a girl is one who doesn't use those apps and realizes what they truly are cause those girls tend to be the down to earth ones since they aren't getting attention from a bunch of random dudes everyday. I guarantee if these apps were removed from society dating would be a much more even ballpark rather than women having all the power.","TL:DR

Basically in the city I‚Äôm in, there are a lot of men I‚Äôm taller than however I‚Äôm not that tall about 5‚Äô7. 

on tinder it‚Äôs hard to tell and the two people I‚Äôve met off it, I just ended up letting them know it‚Äôs not for me. 

everyone has certain physical aspects that enable the initial attraction for them. 

In my case it‚Äôs hard to see a man my height or shorter in a romantic light, I might really like your personality and would spend time with you(as acquaintances or Friends) but a sexual or romantic attraction just wouldn‚Äôt register(there‚Äôs only been one exception in my entire life to this). 
So I put my height on there to kind of let shorter men just avoid me all together. 

if they don‚Äôt and we match there‚Äôs absolutely no issue but I will not directly say to a person‚Äôs face or by text that ‚Äúoh I don‚Äôt think anything romantic can happened between us because I‚Äôm just not attracted to you since we are the same height‚Äù etc I find that demeaning to say to a person  frankly because  it‚Äôs something they can‚Äôt change..

I just recently found this sub and have seen SO MANY 
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt approach her, she doesn‚Äôt want it...blah blah blah‚Äù.
That makes me so sad for us :(



I‚Äôll say it, since no one else seems to want to.
The only reason a woman won‚Äôt take kindly to you approaching her?  
Is if she considered you ugly, and is NOT interested. Or you come across as creepy. If you can‚Äôt take a no, etc.


It‚Äôs so easy to go up to a girl and say ‚Äúhey, I thought you were cute and just had to talk to you! I‚Äôm ____, what‚Äôs your name?‚Äù

Then small talk blah blah blah 
Then you ask for her number. 

If at ANY moment she says she has a boyfriend? Don‚Äôt keep pressuring her. Take the L boys ü§£ it‚Äôs ok, some people just won‚Äôt be interested. 
Also, watch body language, in dating...you have to be intuitive. 
If someone seems uncomfortable that you‚Äôre there? end the conversation, kindly. And LEAVE HER ALONE üñ§

I can assure you, most women want to be approached. Most people dare over online dating. Unless you‚Äôre in it for hookups, then they‚Äôll be all for online dating, maybe. 




Here‚Äôs a deer analogy I heard recently...
Say you live in a wooded area.
There are lots of deer around and there are signs alerting others to 
‚ÄúNo feeding the deer‚Äù
You may think, oh but they‚Äôre so cute I‚Äôll just feed them anyway! 
But there‚Äôs a reason that sign is there. 
When you feed the deer it loses the need to go and hunt it‚Äôs food.
It loses the fear of people.
therefore, it will frolic along to any hunter thinking they have food. 
They become complacent seeing as they have no need to hunt because people are bringing the food to them. 
Instead of helping them, you‚Äôre hurting them. ‚òπÔ∏è




That‚Äôs what we‚Äôre doing to men on here with the repeated ‚Äúdon‚Äôt approach women‚Äù 
Stop it. Men, I can assure you, if you‚Äôre kind and respectful a lot of women  will admire the bravery it takes to approach someone!
And in the event they are not interested,some might introduce you to a friend or encourage you to  continue your approaches ‚ù§Ô∏è


Ladies, isn‚Äôt online dating exhausting? Let‚Äôs encourage our men with ways to approach us how we like to be approached than to belittle them for following their instincts.
Granted, many men do not know how to adequately approach us.
Therefore, coming off as creeps. 
Yet, that isn‚Äôt the approach itself,
It is the way it was carried out.

Ladies; if you have any tips for men on grooming so that they can improve their looks, or ways in which you feel most comfortable being approached? Feel free to please share! üå∏

Gentlemen, if you‚Äôd like to share as well? Please do. 
Also, Approach us! ‚ù§Ô∏è","I know you have good intentions but this is one of those experienced differences that I don't think a lot of women can really understand

As a guy you learn pretty quickly that you have to go through a lot of social rejections and embarrassment to find one girl that may be compatible with you

If three different men approached you you will probably find one indifferent and find one unattractive and probably find one attractive even if they all did the exact same thing

Every woman is different and that's something I still have to remind myself of when I get in dark places

What is creepy to you will be attractive to another girl and vice versa but the hardest thing about that as a guy is that we are the pursuers so we cannot sit back and pick out people who come to us

We have to actively put our self-esteem and reputation on the line."

dating,z5sh1z,2022-11-27 05:16:57,Advice for some in this community.,"Hello, as much empathy as I have for the people in this community, I feel like I need to shed some light on a topic most people often overlook, or rarely ever bring up, and it may ruffle some feathers but if it does oh well down vote it all you want. 

And no this isn't any theory or ""technique"" or PUA shit, but real life experience coming from someone who has applied it to my own life.

I cannot 100% say if this applies for the girls as I don't know what the dating world is like for females but most likely it will, but my advice is If you aren't attracting any females and your life isn't the way you want it to be.. Understand **it's you're doing.**

So much of the posts that I've read in this community are people complaining about height, race, insecurity, that stupid belief that you have to be tall and super hot, basically that dating all together is completely stacked against you. Other things I read about are people with anxiety, low self esteem, awkwardness, creepiness and overall negativity.

**Understand that almost all of those issues are from inside,** if your mind is all fucked up and negative, your outer world going to reflect that of someone with a fucked up mindset... **when you become stuped in negativity, you attract and breed more negative circumstances.** No amount of techniques or scripts of ""what to say next"" or PUA knowledge is going to fix what's really happening up there in your mind, you will still be the same person you were before.

To see some actual long lasting results **you need to take responsibility** for your awkwardness, your insecurities, your inability to communicate like normal human beings, because after all women are just human beings, and recognize the REAL issues that you might have are inside and work on yourself.. it takes some time but when you actually change your old ways and learn to love life and yourself, you'll get completely different results.

Stop the negative thinking, the fact that you come here to complain and obsess that dating is horrible and this and that tells me you live in a negative world and have some issues within you that reflect on your outer world, hence your issues with dating.

Most of the dating advice out there doesn't really touch on this subject so take this advice and really think about how you can start to improve your mindset to see better results.. stop the race and height bullshit because there are people like you that are happily dating, the difference is the mindset.","While it would be popular opinion to agree with you, I‚Äôd have to actually disagree with you and offer a dissenting opinion.

First, I DO agree with you that if you think negatively about yourself, that person ultimately should change their mindset because they are hurting themselves emotionally.

But dating, whose goal is to ultimately find a life partner, is a bit different.  And the studies repeatedly bear that out.

Plenty of people who have üö©or self-esteem issues are in long-term relationships and are married, just like plenty of people who are well adjusted and have green flags are chronically single.

In fact, studies show there are no emotional/psychological differences between the long-term partnered and the long-term single people.  Please see: [Few Differences Between Single and Coupled People](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/living-single/201010/stereotypes-singles-robust-actual-differences-between-singles-and-couples?amp)

This typically means that those who meet that special person who eventually become their partner do so largely because of luck.  Had they not had that chance encounter, they would have still been single.  This is regardless of personality or self-esteem issues.

I take issue with your post because it stereotypes single people and largely comes across as unhelpful.  It‚Äôs the equivalent of telling a depressed person that they need to be less depressed.  For some people, certain aspects of dating are a punishing affair and they should be allowed to vent.

That‚Äôs why I take a different approach.  Instead of shaming the struggles that single people go through, acknowledge that some luck is involved in meeting that other person and that these people have simply not met that other person yet.  Positive encouragement is needed and not the ‚Äútake responsibility‚Äù theme that is central to your post.  While it is well intentioned, some aspects of life are beyond people‚Äôs control.

If you want to help, start setting people up.  Maybe both people will get lucky. :)"

But it's so odd - I socialize a lot, often in places where hitting on people is okay too like bars and clubs, but also just through friends, going to shows, karaoke bars etc.  
  
I also occasionally have university meetups or events since I'm doing my PhD.  
  
I feel like every time I've talked to a guy in the wild in the last few months who I thought was cute, it turned out he already had someone (obviously I didn't know in advance). My working theory is that they have a non-threatning vibe because they aren't looking for anything, or that I just happen to have good taste if another woman has already snagged him? I don't know. Maybe.  
  
Point is, I'm starting to get pretty bummed and also somewhat perplexed. I assume some people will say I could try sporty hobbies, but I don't actually enjoy them, so I don't want to force myself to do things I genuinely don't care for just to potentially meet a guy. Also, a very sporty person wouldn't be a good fit for me unless they really don't care if I'm not, which in my experience is usually not the case. Plus, I'm busy. If I'm gonna try new hobbies, which I'm very open to, I want to do things I actually enjoy.  
  
So... where are ya'll? Are dating apps really the only option left at this point? I was snooping around looking into speed dating for example but it seemed most people haven't had success through that.","We are at work‚Ä¶. Or focusing on life things.

dating,12jas4k,2023-04-12 05:05:46,A woman does not earn anything from pursuing a man in the initial stages. Quite the contrary actually,"I have noticed that the general consensus in this subreddit is that a woman should at least reciprocate and mirror the interest a man shows in her in the initial courting stages if not actually take the whole initiative herself and actively bring a man in her life.

I do not agree with this and I think it works quite detrimentally to a woman's interests if she does not give the man space to prove that he actually wants her for a committed relationship. I will give you my reasons why I think this is so and I am also open to changing my view (if proven otherwise).

A woman who pursues a man with the interest in bringing him into her life without first letting him prove his interest risks a lot. 
First of all, a man will not object to this because he'll have his needs met (from sexual needs to emotional, to companionship etc) and be quite happy, but a woman needs more than basic needs met, she needs security in the form of commitment. Men find it difficult to commit (that is why you see so many posts from women spending years with a man who is happy to reap the benefits a woman gives him but who will make excuses against commitment) because they are not so sure about that particular woman.

A woman is the one who becomes pregnant and needs to know that the man will stand by her to provide and protect, but a man who isn't necessarily sure about her can leave especially in this day and age. This is why women need to leave that space to a man in the initial stages of dating to prove to her that he really does care about her and he is interested in her not just interested in fulfilling his needs (attention, companionship, sex, passing of time etc). Men can spend years in this context but women will that something is missing.

In addition to this, take sex for example. Women don't easily reach orgasm as men do. Women often are left unsatisfied. 

My take on this is that I won't really put in work in the initial courting stages for a man. No. You as a man need to show me through your actions and words that you are interested in me.","Why should a man keep pursuing a woman if she doesn't reciprocate it back? It just indicates that she doesn't want anything to do with him and that he isn't a priority for her. 

In the initial stages, how are men supposed to proceed if they are met with a brick wall? Do they need to just hope and pray that their efforts will somehow break down that wall?

Why would anyone want to waste time with someone who doesn't show interest back? It sounds like you want a man's attention without giving anything in return in the beginning, and then he has to hope and pray you like him."
dating,11x4jqc,2023-03-21 02:43:27,The tables have turned‚Ä¶,"I‚Äôm 24F and today I got ghosted for the first time. First of all. Why. The . Fuck. Does rejection hurt so badly??? 

I have gone on dozens of dates, I‚Äôve also had 4-5 boyfriends etc, but I‚Äôm always the one who leaves, or at the very least the relationship was just so drug out that we mutually ended it. I usually don‚Äôt ghost people as I‚Äôm a very efficient communicator but I‚Äôm not afraid to reject anyone at any point and ending relationships usually doesn‚Äôt cause me too much pain.

I met someone on a dating who left me nervous and with butterflies in my stomach. He may have been the most attractive guy I‚Äôve ever seen (imo probably not traditionally) We texted for weeks, he made me feel pretty and desired. We decided to meet in person last night. He lives a few hours away so I decided to drive to him and we agreed if the vibes were okay I‚Äôd just spend the night. 

I thought it went so well, like genuinely thought I could see myself with this guy. It only got weird when I rejected having sex with him. (He mentioned wanting a long term relationship and I told him before coming I wouldn‚Äôt be down to have sex because that‚Äôs just a little too soon and he agreed to that)

He basically sent me home this morning, told me to text him when I got home. I obliviously thought things were going to be the same when I got home. I texted him and then a few hours later with no response I started getting nervous. I decided to double text him after about 4 hours just incase. Hours later, nothing.I checked instagram and saw he‚Äôs been active all day. I posted an instagram story today and he even viewed it. 

Honestly I feel really shitty about myself and I just don‚Äôt have a lot of experience with rejection so I have no idea how to manage these emotions. I feel stupid for falling so fast as normally I have such a hard time falling for people and usually it takes me forever. I‚Äôm scared this is going to damage my view of dating even more.

dating,zq59j1,2022-12-19 22:12:01,Why is it ‚Äúsuper easy‚Äù for me to get a girlfriend but am struggling to get hookups?,"I am 22M. In my life I had 3 girlfriends all objectively looking 9/10 and better, super nice, smart, succesful girls. 

But when it comes to hookups I rarely pull something like 7ish or better looking girls. 

(I know judgeing by looks 1-10 is awful but I think you will know what I mean)

This question got in my head after I saw hundreds of memes and also real posts saying: ‚Äúhow do I even get a girlfriend?‚Äù And I was like this is the most natural thing to me but how do you get fwb or hookups is wayyy more difficult to me.","Hookups are based almost entirely off physical attraction. Relationships women will factor in your career, personality, potential, etc. Sounds like you probably have a good career or trending towards one, are a considerate guy, etc, but may not be the cream of the crop that gets all the hookups online (ie the 6'5 Chris Hemsworth types or whatever is hot these days lol)"
dating,zet8cm,2022-12-07 05:38:04,Result of an experiment on Hinge - Role of race/skin color in online dating success,"It is a long post about the little experiment with my friend to see how race/skin color might influence dating success in US/Canada.

I (M36, single, never married, 5'7'ish) from South Asia came to Canada in the Fall of last year for work and started online dating at the beginning of this year. The experience has been brutal. I have tried OkCupid, Hinge, Tinder, and Bumble without much success. I got on average one date in 45-60 days, some of which turned into 2nd or 3rd dates, but all eventually told me that I gave friendly vibes. I will write another post summarizing my experience and learnings.

I am an introverted/geeky person. I socially drink, eat meat, and never smoke. I consider myself average looking but physically fit. I started working out a few months ago. My requirements/standards for a match, I think, are reasonable: no prior kids, age range (-5/+3), no piercing/tattoos (definitely not excessive), educated, reasonably fit (not obese), and have a job. I don't have any racial preference and am open to meeting any woman/girl as long as I feel minimum physical and emotional compatibility. Further, I consciously tell my brain to not get ""distracted"" by good, sexy photos before liking/swiping. I don't swipe on empty profiles or profiles with explicit photos because I am 100% certain that they wouldn't swipe back (LOL) and that it wouldn't work out in the long term anyway.

A couple of these dates became platonic friends and told me about the influence of cultural factors (indirectly racial preferences) in online dating. They even confessed that online dating was also harder for local guys and even harder for immigrants but they couldn't help me either beyond giving some feedback on my profile. After going through multiple cycles of deleting/recreating/redoing the dating profile, I finally became jaded but also don't wanna give up.

I asked my American friend, who lives in an American city, for help and he suspected the same issue of racial preference. So, he also became curious and agreed to create the same Hinge profile as mine. Since he is married, he had to seek formal approval from his wife to avoid getting divorced LOL. He used mostly average, some old/not-so-good/poorly cropped, six photos and uploaded them. All other details were the same as my profile.  We started the experiment during the 1st week of November 2022 and ended a few days ago. As soon as he created his profile he began getting 'likes'. He also sent all likes almost daily, but without a comment to avoid any interaction. He 'X-ed' all likes received and made no further interaction with any matches. After getting not a single match/like after 7-8 days, I deleted my profile out of frustration.

Based on my past Hinge experience, I got 4-5 matches in Hinge from every 100 likes I sent and got 1-2 dates for every 10 matches. So, 4-5% match ratio and a 0.5 % date ratio. My friend sent over 190 likes before deleting the profile and got 15 matches. Of course, some of the likes he sent might have turned into matches over the next few days. He also got about 25 likes.  To be fair, all matches/likes have to be compatible, and not of the likes he received met his or my standards. Still, all of that happened with minimal effort in profile creation or photos on his part. He used my (possibly) boring/geeky prompts, without using his own input. So, had he actually tried, he should have been more successful. I verified all these from his Hinge data.

While it is hard to say whether race alone was a factor but given that everything else was the same and photos were average, it was definitely an important factor.  I cannot judge his attractiveness but I would guess that he would be a regular, maybe average/slightly above American guy.  I understand people have preferences and they make choices based on that. I wouldn't even call racial preference in making a personal decision racism. My purpose behind writing this post is not to judge people either. However, I am simply venting that people from no country - no matter how liberal, progressive, wealthy, or developed - are truly free from such biases no matter what they say or how educated they become. It is a different question whether having such biases is a good or bad thing and I don't know the answer since I also have such biases as well, and therefore, am not perfect either.

If you say go to big cities for success,  I think it is unlikely to be useful. As a matter of fact, I changed my city in Hinge to Toronto for a week, with no success or even fewer matches. I even changed to NYC, where I got a couple more matches but that was about it. There were no 'flood' gates. Having 2 matches instead of 1 means 200% improvement, but practically it is insignificant.

If you say why I don't find someone from my country. It is a good question and arrange marriage is an option.  I have been trying that but many times the potential match is in another country and/or already well-established. Also, I am just starting over again and I don't want to leave North America in the mid to long-term future. So, in nearly all cases there are logistical issues in arranged marriages LOL. Also, I don't know if I can make that decision over a video call since it might be years before visit back to my home country again. So, it hasn't been that convenient either.

Back to my dating life, here are some observations, some of which are already well-known to the Online Dating Community (OLD). Please note that these are generally true, but not always.

1. Photos and the rules (1 & 2) mostly matter if you are ""one of them"", which could be based on race or skin color, etc. There could be zillion other factors.
2. Once you are one of them, your profile mostly matters if you have good photos.
3. In your good photos, rules 1 and 2 are still supreme - be attractive, and don't be unattractive in your photos. Or if you are attractive, all your photos become good.

My final words to men/guys, especially those who are white or American/Canadian and have a job, but are still struggling to even get a date: if I can get one date in two months, then you can easily get at least one date every 1-2 weeks. If you are not getting any dates, then, to be honest, I wouldn't blame apps or women/girls for that. I think you need to get some good smiling outdoor pics and maybe some non-creepy non-generic prompts. You can easily get dates. Whether you can convert those dates into a relationship is another matter.

TLDR: I (brown South Asian) asked my white (US Caucasian) friend to create a Hinge profile the same as mine (every single detail) but use his photos and choose the same city (in Southern Ontario, but not Toronto) as mine. He got 2-3 times more matches and 10-15 times more likes than I did.

&#x200B;

Edited: minor changes to protect personal details ","Honest question man, like I just don‚Äôt get foreign dudes infatuation with white women on this site. 

Date some brown girls man! They‚Äôre lovely! 

I knew the moment I saw this post it‚Äôs gonna be directed at white dudes with underlying envy. 

There is some simple science to this man. The US and Canada are still predominantly white for the time being, not just white people - but every race - still largely dates and marries within their own race. That may be less because of preference but because we‚Äôre still tribalistic animals at heart.

Like I like mixed race and Spanish girls, but I know I‚Äôm probably gonna end up with a white women because that‚Äôs just how shit works out. Do I care, not really? 

But at the end of the day, yes I as a white guy am always gonna have more success than you as a brown guy because the area that I live in has more people that look like me."

Treating your partner with lust, desire. Slapping her ass when i come home, making time to make sex out of nowhere, doing unpredictable things, not following routine, suprising your partner with new things.


As far as im concerned, pure lust and desire is objectification in simplest form.

So my question is:

Why is this considered objefication of women and its treated like the most hateful thing to do to women, while when im not doing it after they got used to it, its suddenly not okay that i stopped doing it, because they liked it.

It feels like im guilty for doing it. Feels like im guilty to be the villain to manipulate them only to show them what they will like or what not. How they are supposed to know what they like if they didnt try it yet.

It's so frustrating.,"I am just finishing a diet where I lost about 13 lb so far and another 3 lb to go. Just cutting some body fat. Then I'll get back to trying to gain muscle after that. 

It occurs to me how insanely easy it is for a woman to be attractive. All she has to do is what I just did - go on a diet for a few months. Lose 10-20 lb. Or if she's very overweight, diet longer and lose more. It's zero challenge. I eat a bag of vegetables for nutrition, have a protein shake, and have a small meal or two. This is honestly not hard. I could do this forever with just a bit of willpower.

If I was a woman, I would already be in the top 1% just from my body fat not being obese. Yet as a man, everything I do is worthless. Women don't care about this type of hard work unless you're a steroided top 1% genetics Instagram model.

What can you do as a man to become attractive? Make money? Get new clothes? Get a fancy camera? Read self-improvement books? Post for profile reviews? Make female friends? None of these things matter. Done all and still zero matches.

The only guys who are attractive to women are the same ones who were attractive at 12 years old. You're either born with the narrow range of genetic looks they want or you're fucked. 

Being a man while trying to become attractive is a joke. While for a woman the bar couldn't be lower. Literally just do what I've done the past few months (which was incredibly easy compared to everything else I've tried to do) and you will make it to the top tier.

dating,965r9p,2018-08-10 10:25:48,"To the women of Tinder, I've seen glasses of water with more depth.","A little about me here: What I would call maturity I've had for a lot longer than even the earliest of my peers. Growing up on a farm and transplanting to the city I've been given a wide berth of ""acceptable"" behavior. Meaning I can self govern, and rely on others to set the bar for behavior... You might even say I have principles, but I wouldn't. So I'd like to drop a little bit of that male 26y/o aged wisdom, be it as it may...   


As a self proclaimed mature adult, these are a few of my pet peeves:  
\-I really don't care about your pets (yet), and if you care about them more why should I waste my time?  
\-Take you ""on an adventure?"" I'm not your maitre 'd and life isn't your fucking restaurant. Meet me halfway.  
\-Snapchat/instagram/whatever-the-fuck is narcissistic, and those filters don't do much but make me question why.  
\-Reading, hiking, and netflix aren't personality traits. They at best fill time, and very little of it at that. They don't define anything about you or your interests. They can allude to personality traits, and not all of them good.   
\-""just ask"" is the worst way of saying ""I'm lazy.""   
\-I'm looking for your love, courage, happiness, and values... not your thousands of (selfie) snapchat filters and party photos.  
\-I was taught to cook, sew, weld, monkey wrench, carve, speak softly and maintain good manners for the simple goal of being no more and no less 50% of a team. Zest for life and poetry come extra, but not at a premium. You should expect that basic package, but if you demand it... you'll only find false promises from guys that think they can put in the minimum for T and A. When dealing with the ""good"" guys, ""extras"" should break the tie... don't feed the trolls. There are a lot of subjective values here, insert as ye may. 

Now for the wisdom bits: Firstly, I'm touched by the magic of autism. I'm pretty assuredly going to be -off- on some things here. But like art, sometimes it takes a new perspective to really appreciate the essence of something. People's inner workings are a mystery to me sometimes, but I can tell you that shit is rotten even without knowing what powers it.   


Secondly, everyone is human. Which also means everyone is fucking broken in some way. They can be beautifully broken, tragically broken, and contently broken. If you're comfortably numb, narcissistic, depressed, and/or hedonistic... that's okay. I love you anyway. No matter your particular brand of bullshit, human beings can love just about anything -- with the caveat that you try to do better. If it's the new 'meta' to gussy up shit with filters and platonic platitudes, think for yourself and get out of that perfumed shit show. The only person you can be superior to is yourself -- yesterday, any attempt at something more will net you more broken traits and shit. Just be the best -you- everyday.   


And for fucks sake... be present in life. ","Some honest advice: drop the holier than thou attitude and chill. This might be hard to believe but you are no ""deeper"" or more mature than anyone around you."

I'm tough, I ignore it.  She continues to scream louder, pressing her body into me, totally invading my space, as much space as you can have at a crowded concert.  I'm a big guy and can handle myself well and would never dream of hitting another women. 

She continues, stepping onto her tippy toes to get closer to my ear. I look at my girlfriend. She just looks at me. 

The random girl continues to scream into my ear, then she grabs my arm and starts shaking my arm violently, digging her nails into my arm.  I'm looking at my girlfriend like,"" are you going to do anything?""

After being assaulted and harassed by this girl for over a minute, she just went away. 

I was very upset that my girlfriend didn't defend me. I'm a guy, I would never dream of ever putting my hands on a woman. 

However, if the roles were reversed and a dude did this to my girl, I would have fucked him up. But a girl does this to me and my girl just sits there and watches. 

How could she just let this chick scream in my ear and assault me without defending me or at the very least going to get security?

Thoughts?  Suggestions?","She assaulted you, I would have pushed her away. That's not ""hitting a woman"" that's stopping a crazy person from assaulting you.

Women don't get a free pass from harassment...

The GF part is irrelevant, stand up for your own body"

dating,12sd671,2023-04-19 22:47:51,I was told by several dudes that I‚Äôm fat,"So I went on a couple of dates within a few week period. One guy I went on a few dates with that I met off of Facebook dating. He seemed like a nice guy at first. But then he made it clear that he thinks of me as more of a sister. I said ok. I also asked him if my weight had anything to do with it and he dodged the question with a comment saying ‚Äúwant to work out at the gym‚Äù? So I took that as him implying I was fat. 

Then I went on a single date with a guy I knew from high school. The second I approached him at our agreed meeting spot, his eyes bugged out of his head at my appearance. He told me he remembers me being skinny back in the day and he doesn‚Äôt date ‚Äúfat girls‚Äù. I was very offended and made me feel more self conscious about my curves. 

The point of this post is that I know I‚Äôm curvy but what ever happened to not judging someone based on the outside? What about what‚Äôs inside? What happened?","People have always judged others by their appearance.

dating,zq6lcc,2022-12-19 23:04:30,Attracted to a man i find repulsive,"

I am 22 he‚Äôs 24. 



I feel embarrassed and weird but here we go. 


This guy, ‚ÄúX‚Äù is a close friend of the guy my bestie is seeing. 


X is everything i find disgusting in people. Arrogant. Thinks he‚Äôs in a movie at all times. Macho man. H0rny asf. Thinks with his dick. Would f^ck anything. Idolizes Tony Montana. Always has sunshades on his eyes or head. Acts like a maf1a boss. Thinks its cool to put his leg up while driving. Is just soooo childish. 
He sadly also knows he is very, very good looking and lots of ladies like him. Which completely gets to his heads. He really thinks he‚Äôs above everyone, including the law. 



The first time we met he flirted with me. I was not impressed, i already had a clear image of his personality. We ended up having an argument because he just ignored me after that and i thought that was childish of him and he said well u‚Äôr not interested what should i do? Alcohol was involved. Btw he ended up buying me drinks & water after our fight even though i told him i didn‚Äôt want him to. 




Second time we met he greeted me with an ‚Äúhey my love how r u‚Äù which made me sick to my stomach, i immediately corrected him telling him he has to call me by my name. I ignored him after that and talked with the others. 
We ended up at a super crowded bar, where a random guy randomly hugged me and kissed my cheek. X immediately attacked him and our friends had to separate them. I was like hm yeah thanks that was nice whatever. 




Third time he was absolutely distant and just said hey. That night we all went to the club and drank. I was just really drunk. I don‚Äôt know why that happened but i ended up sitting on his lap and we danced together. Apparently we were sitting on opposite ends and we kept staring at each other & he just told me to get closer and i got on his lap. 
This isn‚Äôt everything. I constantly bit his neck and face  and  i was squeezing his cheeks‚Ä¶ all while whispering in his ear how he sucks and i hate him. He kept looking me in the eyes, laughing and then he kissed me. I broke the kiss to tell him he‚Äôs disgusting just to immediately going back to kiss him. 




My friend who wasn‚Äôt too drunk had observed the whole thing and that was the moment she stepped in to separate us. The next day she told me it looked like we were about to f%ck on the spot. 
Of course i had a mental breakdown about what happened cause of how i felt about X. I couldnt believe i ended up giving him what he wanted and submitting to his ego. This resulted in me staying home and ditching work for 3 days. 





Just to end up seeing him again one week later. I didn‚Äôt know he was gonna be present btw. 

I didn‚Äôt want to say hey to him (we were on a parking lot) but when he came up close to me and i kinda backtracked he said ‚Äúand then u say i am the one who has no manners‚Äù. So i quickly gave him a peek on the cheek. 



I then went inside my car cause i didn‚Äôt feel comfortable in his presence while my best friend, her guy and my other friend kept talking. 
X showed up 5 min later and demanded to be let in the car ‚Äúto talk‚Äù. He said we could forget about what happened in the club and it would be no biggie, i dont have to feel bad but also said ‚Äòi can now admit that i am attracted to him, its ok‚Äô. 
I told him i think he is repulsive and i don‚Äôt know what got into me & just blamed the alcohol. He said whatever, he doesn‚Äôt care anyway. Then left my car. 






I didn‚Äôt drive myself home right in that moment because i was the driver of the night, or else i would have. I was so mad at him and at myself for allowing such a thing to happen. I also felt completely embarrassed by the fact that my loud words didn‚Äôt end up matching my actions. 






Two weeks pass. So this last friday i was at the club. With my bestie and other friends. My bestie‚Äôs guy was there too. X was not supposed to come cause apparently he was on the other side of the country. I get super drunk. He magically shows up. Out of nowhere. 


I was dancing and he just happens to be behind me. We kinda dance together. I kiss him. He kisses me back briefly and then stops. Tells me ‚Äúgather the balls to kiss me while sober‚Äù and just goes to other people/ his friends. 




Drunk me was like ok whatever. But the day after i was totally on the ground. So embarrassed and ashamed like never before. 
And then it hit me‚Ä¶ I am attracted to him. I don‚Äôt know how that‚Äôs possible but its the case. 


The fact that he is absolutely gorgeous and has the hottest voice i ever heard is NOT a valid reason. Cause his personality and way of being sucks and i find him so disgusting yet i am attracted to him. I can‚Äôt even believe i was able to admit this to myself. I suspect that i was attracted to him since the first second i saw him but like my dislike and denial were too strong at that moment. And now? What do i even do? I will never be able to admit to him i am attracted to him. 



I will also not hook up with someone i find repulsive. I also don‚Äôt know how i am supposed to keep seeing him everytime i have to hangout with my bestie and her guy its 90% sure that X will be there too. Any advixe and perspective is welcome.",This sounds like a bad wattpad story lmao
dating,mzcddc,2021-04-27 00:35:48,"If women dont like to be approached at the gym, why do I see so many women talking to other guys at the gym?","I've read a ton of articles by women saying how they dont like to be approached at the gym, how they just want to get their workout done and leave, or how they want to be ignored. 

&#x200B;

But I've been going to gym for years and no matter where I go, 3/5 of the women I see at the gym always are having conversation with the men there. Having conversations that they seem to enjoy because I see them smiling all the time. The thing is I've had glances at women and they have glanced back at me almost 3 times in a row, but I still get the feeling that they dont want me to approach them, obviously for this reason I dont. 

&#x200B;

But why do I see so many women having conversation with men in the gym if a lot of them preferred to be ignored or not approached while working out?","Without knowing what they are talking about, the purpose of their conversation, how they know each other and what they are feeling there‚Äôs no way to know what exactly you are witnessing. 

People talk. They smile. They may appreciate one persons approach and not another‚Äôs. They may not want attention on one day but be open to it another. There are no set rules, so like you have been doing, you need to play it by ear. In general though, if a girl at the gym has her earphones in and is working out it‚Äôs more likely that she‚Äôs focusing on that and not going to be as welcoming to an interruption."

Naturally, I am an independent person & straightforward. Yes, I do flirt directly & responsive towards my dates as well before someone points that out. I have recently been told by couple of guys that I am intimidating & thats why they are scared to approach me for a second date. I haven't mentioned anything in my bio that says so.. However I do ask a lot of questions on the date like hobbies & interests which is pretty normal..

My only guess is that prior first date I do specify that I am a structured person with a routine on working days so I will not be hopping last minute to see someone unless there's a plan in place. Also I prefer people who have a set routine & who take care of their health, mental & physical so I do ask a lot of questions based on that..

About the two guys who gave me ""the feedback"", I have thanked them for it & not spoken after. It takes courage to be honest & I appreciate their pov.","Idk about intimidated but I think most men find dominant personalities in women a turn off. Like even if she‚Äôs attractive, she loses her luster a bit.

And then I realized why...

She hasn't sucked your dick yet.

You maybe haven't even gotten to your first date yet, much less slid to home base. This is a delicate time. If you leave her alone too long, she might look or think about some other guy and decide to suck his dick instead. Her pictures are hot. She's been nice to you. Do NOT ruin this man.

""How was your day?""

""Great! üòäüíó How was your day?""

I started to go out more on the hopes of meeting someone. However it dawned on me that the girls I'm into (fitness oriented, athletes, body building types)who are as serious about fitness, and show it on their physiques, don't frequent happy hour or stay out late at bars. 

And, the consensus is that most women do not want to be approached or courted at the gym. So it's a catch 22. The place that they frequent the most is a no-go zone. And the places where it's socially acceptable to approach and meet them are in places that they frequent often ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

I also think its psychologically detrimental if you have kids. Even after an OF content creator retires, naked content of their parents will still float around online.  Which is a recipe for serious bullying but also discrimination towards the child by school staff and other parents.

So he was 37, about sixteen years my senior.

He was attractive and financially successful. Throughout the two-hour date, he kept saying how he doesn't like going on apps in our Southern city because the girls aren't as fit and there are some single moms. He also implied several times that he simply does not find women his age attractive.

He mentioned his salary (which is high) about forty times. He kept talking about the car and house he wanted, as well as the house he bought.

I felt as if I were in a cartoon. At one point, he claimed to have a stack of books in his old apartment in a European city where he was stationed for his job (in hedge fund management), which he never read, kept there to impress others, and simply gave away when he moved.

He didn't have anything inside of him. He had no appreciation for beauty, art, or love, or anything else. His entire plan was to find the smartest and most beautiful woman under 30 to date him, and that was the end of it.

I've read a lot of dating complaints from women on this site, and I want you to know that being alone is preferable to being with someone like that.

dating,11ac6og,2023-02-23 23:27:58,I (31F) slept with a power player (50M) in my industry and I feel so used and cheap/like I‚Äôve made a big mistake. What should I do?,"I (31F) met a guy (50M) through work about eight weeks ago. He works in my industry and is incredibly successful/one of the industry leaders - the type of person that can make or break your career, knows everyone and is a power player. 

We went to lunch six weeks ago to discuss what I thought (and was told!) were work-related matters. He‚Äôd seen my work and wanted to meet to see if we could work together. Obviously, I was really excited about this and the opportunities it could bring. It‚Äôs not often that opportunities like this come about.

Over lunch I definitely found him sexy and attractive but I didn‚Äôt want to act on anything. Although we were laughing and joking, I wanted him to take me seriously. He began telling me about his career and how he got to where he was and to be honest, the power (and the fact he‚Äôs older) turned me on.

Just as I was about to leave, he said he‚Äôd like to take me to dinner. I said sure but was slightly hesitant. The main reason is that I am a female climbing up the career ladder. If people in my circles find out I went on a date with him, they‚Äôd obviously assume I was trying to sleep my way to the top. I have spent YEARS trying to make my career and am just starting to be noticed for my work.

Anyway, over the past six weeks, we texted a lot. He would say things like I‚Äôm beautiful, he really likes me and wants to wine and dine me. He‚Äôd sometimes call or FaceTime me as well. It is obviously flattering having someone in a high position saying these things to you, but I am not stupid - I know what men can be like. Still, I wanted to believe that I was special.

We planned a couple of dates but he cancelled both of them, saying he was ill. I do believe he was unwell but experience tells me if they keep cancelling they are not that interested romantically. So, I took a step back and assumed nothing would happen. Perhaps my lack of reciprocity scared him because he kept texting me and apologising profusely afterwards, saying he genuinely was really unwell and was having to fly specialists in from abroad, but would make it up to me eventually.

Right after he cancelled our dinner, he invited me to a works dinner to ‚Äúmake up for it‚Äù. This is an exclusive dinner that many of my work colleagues would not be invited to. Again, I wasn‚Äôt sure if I was in the right stage of my career to attend, but I decided to bite the bullet and go. I went along with my female work colleague but he was nowhere to be seen. I almost felt like he was avoiding me but I have anxious attachment so tend to take things like this as rejection. 

I texted him asking where he was and he didn‚Äôt reply until the following morning, saying he must‚Äôve missed me. I said thanks for the invite and left it at that. He said he‚Äôd try and see me this week and I thought ‚Äúyeah right‚Äù.

Fast forward to yesterday. He texted me at 2pm asking if I was free in the evening for dinner, and if I‚Äôd like to come to ANOTHER fancy works dinner next week. I said sure. He then called me to make plans and said we could meet at his apartment first.

I turned up to his apartment (which was amazing) and we walked to dinner. He kept trying to link arms with me, kept flattering me, etc. To be fair he has lost some weight and looks tired from being unwell, but I still found him attractive.

We were sat in the restaurant, laughing and joking once again, but he would switch between paying me compliments, to saying immature stuff like ‚Äúthe waitress is hot‚Äù. I asked if he wanted children and he said he‚Äôd like a baby, but without the ‚Äúhassle‚Äù and ‚Äúdrama‚Äù of a woman (?). He then said he‚Äôd be the type of ‚Äúold man‚Äù I‚Äôd think fondly about when I eventually got married. He said stuff like ‚Äúwe should go on a trip to X!‚Äù or ‚Äúwe should go to X for a spa day!‚Äù, then saying he struggles to be in a relationship. He even offered to help me with anything I need in my career - anything at all.

I began drinking because I felt‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ sad. I‚Äôd been looking forward to this date and assumed he liked me because of the non-stop communication & compliments for the past 6 weeks. 

To cut a long story short, we went back to his apartment and started making out. One thing led to another and we slept together. It was good, but literally less than 10 mins after we finished, he said he was going to have a bath now and did I have enough money for a cab home.

As I was ordering my car, I made a comment about how I‚Äôd never dated anyone with his star sign before. It was a throwaway comment but he turned round and said ‚Äúwe‚Äôre not dating‚Äù really abruptly. I just said, ‚Äúyeah, I meant in general‚Äù. He made it very clear that a relationship would never come out of this‚Ä¶ which contradicts some of the comments he‚Äôd said to me before, like how I could be his second wife (a weird joke but whatever). He then said he‚Äôd get his assistant to send me info for the dinner next week. I said I regretted sleeping with him as that wasn‚Äôt part of my plan for the evening & he said don‚Äôt worry, no one will find out.

He even said ‚Äústick with me‚Äù - that women he dates either become super successful, or end up with great husbands. 

I left his apartment feeling so shitty about myself. I feel really used & cheap‚Ä¶ and confused as hell.

I don‚Äôt want mean comments on here because I know, and feel, incredibly stupid. But now I don‚Äôt know what to do. It‚Äôs clear he is not the relationship kind, but if I ghost him or be rude, it could really damage my career. He texted this morning asking if I got home alright and I said yes. I don‚Äôt plan on initiating any texts anymore.

How do I play this now that my emotions are involved? Or do I just play him at his own game and use him back, even though that‚Äôs not my character?

dating,yk2ugg,2022-11-02 11:37:46,Is he just interested in sex?,"I (F20) matched with this guy (M38) from tinder a little less than 2 weeks ago. We first met at his place and he cooked lasagna for me (it was pretty good lol). We really were vibing, had great talks and ended up having sex. He texted me later and we agreed to meet up again a couple of days after. Same thing happened but this time, we were way more relaxed and had a lot more fun (he‚Äôs HILARIOUS like, really). Yesterday we met again at his place, had pizza, laughed, had sex and tried to sleep. The more I get to know him, the more I realize that I really like his vibe. Like he makes me laugh so much to the point I have a headache but other than that, he really has a lot of great qualities. I‚Äôd like to spend more time with him outside of his place like going on dates, doing activities together and get to know each other on another level. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôd be too abrupt from my part to make a move or should I wait for him to ask me on a proper date? I don‚Äôt want to seem desperate or scaring him away haha so idk how I could kinda hint at him that I want to get outta the living room","Age aside for a moment.

First, never go to their place for a first date, even if it‚Äôs intended to be casual. Meet somewhere first then go if you both feel comfortable. 

Second, if he‚Äôs truly interested in you and reciprocates the feelings you have, he will make (or would have already made) the move to do a proper date. Then again, he might be a total introvert and find it awkward to do so. 

I‚Äôd say the only solid takeaway here is a safety matter. Don‚Äôt go over there on the first date. Everything else (age, vibe, etc) is going to differ based on different Redditor‚Äôs experiences and perspectives."
dating,t8emoi,2022-03-07 02:14:31,Dealing with men with double standards about sex,"
It seems that most men I‚Äôve met have some sort of double standard about sex and partners . I am in my 30s and I have had few partners  I think , compared to most modern women my age who enjoy having casual sex. However I have been involved in sex work at different parts of my life. I have some health issues that have made working a normal job impossible so at some points of my life I was working as a stripper on the weekends and once I had a sugar daddy which is a long term relationship with one man with financial benefits. I did not see my job as a reflection of me and I was never promiscuous. 

I have met many men who have a problem with this and see it as a red flag, yet they see no problem with their own promiscuous past. I have even argued about it with men and one guy I was seeing said that I might not have been promiscuous,  but how would he even know? and why would I perform a job where I am around toxic men if I am so pro womens rights? I explained that showing your body whether it‚Äôs being a stripper, posing for playboy etc doesn‚Äôt mean that you are promiscous,and in fact many strippers I knew were not promiscuous because they saw the worst side of men and were wary of men in general . I also explained that in a time where women are still not equal to men and aren‚Äôt payed equally to men, and where I was just trying to make the most of my health situation , it‚Äôs not really fair to be judging me for trying to survive. He didn‚Äôt believe that women aren‚Äôt payed equally to men and I sent him supporting studies that showed it as well as studies that showed that women aren‚Äôt given the same opportunities as men as far as raises and hiring for the same educational background. Women also cannot work the same jobs as men and there are far less successful trade jobs that women can do compared to men, so that if women want to have a good paying job they will often need a college degree. 

I am tired of explaining myself and I am tired of fighting men on these things. If there should be a double standard at all about sex, it should be that men should be judged more harshly than women for having it then women. Because we still live in a culture where misogyny is still very real and alive, a man telling a woman he has engaged in casual sex I think is more telling that he may view women as sexual objects. In studies where women had casual sex they reported not being satisfied and described feeling used. They felt that the men just used them like a human fleshlight. They didn‚Äôt care about making them orgasm. Women certainly didn‚Äôt feel empowered for having casual sex like many young women feel they should feel for having it today. 

But I‚Äôm not even having casual sex, and I can count the number of times I‚Äôve had a one night stand on my one hand. So how should I approach the conversation? Should I tell men that I used to be a stripper and see how they respond ? Lol. I feel their responses are very telling of the views they hold. I also feel that being forthcoming has its drawbacks and am debating bringing up my past at all , and just asking men about their views on sex and women instead. There have been times when I have disclosed I was a stripper to men I have dated and their friends tried hitting on me thinking I was promiscuous. It created a lot of problems for me to disclose it . While I do like to be honest, I wonder what good can come of it.",Don't waste time explaining yourself to people who have no chill. Anyone who would judge you for that is not someone you want to associate with.

She is charming, attractive and stylish. You start doubting your self, thinking: ""I may not deserve her, she is way more beautiful than I am and she probably has a lot of guys asking her for a date"".

‚úÖ Believe, by default, ""I am good enough for everybody"".

‚úÖ True confidence comes from within and not from external validation.

‚ùå You are playing your ""A game""!

You know that she is getting a lot of attention and you think the best way is to impress her with your ""best moves"": The best pick up line, the best compliment or even bragging about you!

‚úÖ Act normal and be yourself there is no such thing as ""A game"".

‚úÖ Be honest, make a compliment based on her style.

‚ùå You think you NEED her!

dating,kma9f8,2020-12-29 08:14:18,Some positive of giving up on dating/women,"So recently I've decided the best thing to do at my age (29) is just give up on dating/women entirely, completely eliminate the idea of dating or a relationship, or having any sort of romantic attraction to women 

1. I do what I want, eat what I want, dress how I want. I no longer do things to ""be/stay attractive"" in hopes of attracting women. Yes I've gotten less fit as a result but it doesnt bother me, no reason to be fit anyway

2. I no longer get effected by women's preferences. I used to see social media posts about how women want this type of guy, or this height, or how they love this body part on a guy etc and since I never really fit most of their preferences, it would effect my self esteem.

I no longer care about that and it doesnt bother me, because I count myself out of that game already. Can't lose if you dont play

3. If I see an attractive woman or a girl I'm attracted to in person, they just kind of dont do anything for me anymore, because I instinctively write them off in my head before they even register on that level

4. More free time to dedicate to my hobbies without feeling like I'm wasting my time since they aren't things a majority of women are into (gaming/cars/tech etc)

But I am just wondering what does it say about a guy who first proposes to me that we ‚ÄòGo Dutch‚Äô or I take ‚Äòthe next tab‚Äô on our first date and on all follow up dates after? 

I am aware that we live in the 21st century where both guys and girls are perfectly capable of working and earning their own income, and this kind of social norm where guys are expected to pay seems irrelevant. But even so, the conventional social etiquette is that if the guy asks you out, he usually pays for the first date and girls can offer to pay her share. If he proposes that we ‚ÄòGo Dutch‚Äô does this mean that he is not willing to invest in our relationship? ","I think you‚Äôre making a big leap by attempting to correlate who pays on the first date (or any date, really) to investment in a relationship that doesn‚Äôt even exist yet. 

He could have proposed going Dutch for a number of reasons. Some men are just so tired of women using them for a free coffee, drink, meal, and so on that they use the going Dutch approach as a way to deter those women from wanting to go out with them again (or in the first place). There are probably other men who utilize this approach because, similar to the first approach, they want to make sure a woman is not after his money‚Äîand yet another reason is just for budgeting. Going out for coffee, drinks, dinner or whatever with multiple people throughout the course of a month can really add up‚Äîespecially if the guy is expected to pay for both people each time."

I think I'm very needy, when a guy talks to me I do my best to have a good conversation and sometimes I end up sending several messages, audios explaining something I like and maybe that's annoying. When I was a teenager, I remember my friends being asked to go to watch movies and no boy called me, no boy said they liked me or something like that‚Ä¶ it was so cruel that it took me a while to kiss for the first time.

Guys, whats my problem?","It's an interesting problem, I don't know any woman that a vast majority of men wouldn't ""talk to""

You seem to already see some potential flaws in the way you interact with people. You don't need confirmation of reddit to maybe make some adjustments.

It's OK to have a thing or two to self improve on. Unlike what comment sections seem to always say... we are all imperfect humans. A little tweak here or there, a change in perspective... and some self-improvement... you'll be surprised what is possible"
dating,10qoxu5,2023-02-01 09:06:18,Is a girl more likely to be in open relationships and have difficulty falling in love if they are not close to their father or are they completely unrelated?,"
 My question is whether someone becomes like that because of their attachments growing up or if it‚Äôs something that happens on its own. I am really curious as to hear about any one‚Äôs experiences. If someone isn‚Äôt close to their dad, does it make it harder to get close to any guy?

I feel like I tend to get more attached and I think it would be hard for me to not get sad if someone leaves. I think I‚Äôm an anxious attachment so maybe I do that because im not secure myself 

Is someone who is open and doesn‚Äôt fall in love considered secure? As in they don‚Äôt rely or need someone else 

Are they afraid of commitment?",Daddy issues? Really?? We are back to that???
dating,zswdea,2022-12-22 20:45:52,Should a 30 year old man in a relationship be following 20-21 year olds on IG?,I‚Äôm (27f) annoyed with my bf (30m) for following a 21 year old celebrity on Instagram. He used to follow multiple girls this age (some not celebrities) before we started dating and I told him it made me uncomfortable especially when he would like their obvious thirst traps. He was willing to unfollow them back then. This celebrity doesn‚Äôt post anything too risqu√© besides the occasional bikini photos but he was talking about a scene in a movie she was in that he described as a funny but sexual scene. When I confronted him he said he thought she was great in the movie and said he wanted to follow her to keep up with her career. She‚Äôs obviously young and it would be inappropriate to me if he had girl friends that age. It really upset me knowing he went out of his way to do this and I know I‚Äôm especially insecure but is it too much to ask him to stop doing this? Is he being horny on main? He said I was being accusatory when I told him this.,No grown man or BOY should be following women posting risqu√© pictures on Instagram for thirst traps and attention no matter how old he is.

dating,xijlow,2022-09-19 17:55:47,You‚Äôre scared to approach the woman you like because you think she‚Äôs better than you,"If you‚Äôre scared to approach (the woman you like) you think the girl in question will get less from knowing you than you‚Äôll get from knowing her. Essentially, you think she‚Äôs above you and that‚Äôs why you‚Äôre intimidated. Let me give you an example:

How do homeless people approach you when they ask for money? Or what about people who are collecting for charity?

They have a vibe which says ‚ÄúWe know we‚Äôre taking something from you and we feel uncomfortable about it. We also expect you to not want to engage with us.‚Äù

And guess what?

**You usually walk straight past those people don‚Äôt you? You ignore them completely 9 times out of 10.**

But have you ever been stopped on the street by someone who thought they were giving YOU something? Like someone who wanted to interview you for a TV show? If so, how did they approach you?

**Like they were doing YOU a favor.**

Everything about their vibe said ‚ÄúWe have value that you want and respect and guess what? We‚Äôre going to be kind enough to give some of that value to you today you lucky boy!‚Äù

**If you‚Äôre like me and 99% of people, you usually stop and listen when people approach you like that.**

&#x200B;

So what am I saying here?

Here‚Äôs another example. Let‚Äôs say I gave you 10 million dollars and told you to approach the hottest girl you could see and give it to her, would you be scared?

Hell to the no!

And why? Again because you‚Äôd know she was getting value from you. You‚Äôre gonna give that woman a lot of money and if she rejected you, you wouldn‚Äôt even care. You‚Äôd just find someone else who appreciated what you were offering.

&#x200B;

**Know your worth**

Well you know how women always talk about knowing their worth? You need to know yours too because it‚Äôs the difference between approaching like a peasant and being discarded and approaching like a king and being appreciated.

So how are you going to do that?

&#x200B;

**How are you going to know your worth?**

You‚Äôre gonna sit down and write out a list of all your positive points and I do mean all of them from the small things like you being good at cards to the big things like your business skills or whatever. List literally everything you can think of, and I do mean everything.

Also, if you can‚Äôt think of anything, ask people who know you for feedback. Those closest to us will see things inside us that we don‚Äôt necessarily see ourselves and can be great sources of info.

Then, when you‚Äôve put that list together, look at it daily, have it in mind when you approach the woman you like, and watch how confident you become.

**What are your thoughts? Have you tried the list thing?**

dating,wjnkou,2022-08-08 23:27:15,I beat my bf and now he is acting weird around me,"I 22F have a BF 19M, I've been doing MMA training since Middle School. Now I don't look like it many people say, Typical brunette 5 '6 130lbs, always sweet and helpful. But MMA is always something my family bonded over. Well 2 nights ago my BF and I decided to wrestle, it took some convincing for him because I honestly think he might be a little scared of me. He's about 6 ft 165lbs goes to the gym and will sometimes do boxing workouts, he also played football, basketball and track growing up, he also likes MMA but he only watches he doesn't train. Well we decided to wrestle, we were gonna do MMA with all the protective gear on but i didn't want to accidentally hurt him or he hurt me because he is strong. I tapped him out 5 different times before he quit. Now I'll admit I might have gone overboard but something about being on top of him and watching him struggle underneath me was so cute I couldn't help. I could tell he was embarrassed which I also found really adorable, he was blushing and hiding his face in was just SO CUTE! Now he is acting very submissive towards me, now he has always acted like this but I thought it was just because he was shy(which he is) but his friends said he wasn't like that with his old girlfriends. Now he is a very shy boy, it took awhile for him to warm up to me before we started dating(we're in college). But he's been acting WAY more submissive, like cuddling up to me more, and doing anything I ask(foot massages, food, etc) granted he did all this stuff before, It just seems more different now. I really really hope he isn't scared of me because I'll feel so bad, I don't want him thinking I'll hurt him or anything because he is the sweetest boy I've ever met. I just hope nothing changes and we are ok.

Is this a bad thing? Is he scared of me? Will he want to break up with me?

TL;DR I beat my boyfriend and now he is acting very submissive around me.","That was so cringe to read. Normally when rolling or sparring, you and your partner are helping each other improve yourselves and practice your skills. You were out to demonstrate how much better your skills were and literally reveled in his humiliation. A good partner would show him what he‚Äôs doing wrong and how he can get out of those situations. You just wanted to dominate."
dating,vywy52,2022-07-14 14:16:33,"Accidentally said the most creepy thing to the girl I'm dating. Holy s*** I'm so god damn embarrassed right now. Please send help, prayers, or a time machine...","**TLDR:** Accidentally joking soft-proposed to a girl I recently started dating without intending to. Please just read the full context lol, I honestly don't even know how to begin to write a TLDR for this one...

Full context: I've been going out with this girl for 1.5 months now. Today, we got into this really engaging philosophical debate about immortality vs natural death over text. She was on the side of natural death and said she would not consider becoming immortal even if the technology were made available in the distant future. **I jokingly said that I still had 60 years to try to change her mind.**

As soon as she read that, I realized I REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEALY screwed up there. I basically implied that I...

1. Intended to marry her
2. Planned on being with her for 60 years
3. *Essentially wanted to spend all of eternity with her*

THAT WAS WAY TOO GOD DAMN SOON!!! I don't even know why the hell I said that anymore. It's like my brain just mathematically calculated the most cringeworthy series of words to ever exist in the English language, gave them cancer, then spit them out to generate the most ultimate cringeworthy text of all times. And then gave that text cancer again.

After she read that, I admitted that what I said came out wrong, and I didn't mean for it to be so creepy. She agreed that it was ""a bit"" creepy, but said she wasn't concerned or annoyed by it. I just asked her to pretend that never happened, and thankfully we left it at that.

I mean, I do like her alot and I have at some point wondered what it'd be like to spend my future with her. But I didn't even mean it like that. I've just been studying too much and sleeping too little recently, so my brain's been really messed up. 

We've probably only been on 5-6 dates so far. We're both completely new to dating, and the most intimate we've been so far is holding hands. So yeah... if the situation wasn't already awkward enough, I just made it 1000000000000000x worse.

We had plans to study together tomorrow, and I don't know how I should approach her. I'm guessing the safe option is to just not bring up the topic in person again? Some part of me still wants to explain myself, but I don't know how I can do that without making things even more awkward.","Bruh, i think you are overreacting.
I'm pretty sure she is smart enough and won't see it as a marriage proposal or you being a gluey weirdo dude.
The thing is simple: you appear to like her a lot and automatically phrased something that means that. It might not be phrased the best but it's really not a problem on the long run since we are all human and not flawless.
So what you are going to do tomorrow is do your study date with her with a big smile on ya face and both enjoy your time together. No need to explain yourself on this episode, it's already past. Just talk to her like you usually do"

It‚Äôs really a bad feeling to deal with people who don‚Äôt value friendship or being a kind person.

Me and my girlfriend have been together for 6 months now.
Our sex life is rather fcking boring to be honest.
For example i‚Äôm used to rough hard sex, and disrespectful to a certain degree as in pulling hair and slapping.
But with my partner italways starts with me giving her head till she cums. Into missionary and then a position or 2 more. We can‚Äôt do certain positions because of the height difference & that my penis is quite large so it hurts her.
We only have sex in bed aswel. Don‚Äôt get me wrong it feels amazing, but its just so damn predictable and boring.
It got to a point where i just rather masturbate and get over with it. 
I haven‚Äôt initiated sex for 2 weeks now and every time she initiates something i just give her head till she cums and i mind my business again. I don‚Äôt know what to do with this. So any advice is welcome.",Have you tried talking to her?

So never a serious one. He tells me an ‚Äúadult relationship‚Äù means the man is providing all the time. He told me he‚Äôs mostly dated younger women in my age range but he broke up with them bc they were immature but he tells me ‚ÄúI‚Äôm mature for my age.‚Äù He told me how he took his exes credit card away so she wouldn‚Äôt spend money & wanted to buy one a car but put it under his name. But yesterday we had a conversation and I was so appalled at what he was saying, I wrote it exactly as he was speaking. The conversation starts bc I expressed how much I hated how growing up, the boys got to do whatever they wanted but as a girl I had strict rules. 


‚ÄúThe guy is doing the fucking. the girl is getting fucked. You don‚Äôt want your daughter to get fucked but u want ur son to do the fucking.pretty much why  it‚Äôs kinda ok to cheat but it‚Äôs not ok for a woman. U can‚Äôt put mouths on me but I can put mouths on a woman. There‚Äôs a change on ur body but not for men. Men are not made to be monogamous. Men aren‚Äôt made to have one women their whole life.that‚Äôs what u have to take into consideration when getting in a relationship not gonna lie. A man‚Äôs gonna cheat. Not gonna lie he‚Äôs gonna cheat. They‚Äôre  going to  lie to you and say they won‚Äôt but, it‚Äôs all in the way they cheat. If once a month I cheat but I still make sure to take care of my wife but the cheating is purely sex it‚Äôs fine. As long as I‚Äôm not bringing any disease or baby home. When a woman is having sex with a guy he is submitting to a guy. A man is not submitting to a girl. I‚Äôm picky because I don‚Äôt like to use protection but The only reason men get married is to bear children. ‚Äù

 I tell women that are short/average that I'm not interested in them and they seem to get pissed off at me telling me that I'm an asshole for not wanting them because apparently every living man on this Earth wants a woman drastically shorter than them, according to them. I don't feel bad for rejecting women that are tiny to me and they give me more shit about it. They somehow try to seduce and flirt with me by trying to act all cute, but I usually don't and can sense the try hard effort which is a turn off

. A lot of girls that are like 5'1 and under tell me that they dont like guys under 6'0, but I really feel like I'm being degraded cause all they acknowledge in me is my height so I don't really feel valued and there's a lot of guys that are way better looking than me that are rich as well that are shorter than me so I don't get it.

dating,q95r2s,2021-10-16 05:32:56,I want to create an app for long term relationships. Here are some features I came up with.,"Here are some things I came up with:

* Men should only have a very limited number of swipes a day, since otherwise they just swipe on every girl with the hopes that one swipes back.
* Women should be free to swipe as much as they want.
* Both should get penalties for not writing back. This will have a stronger effect on women.
* There should be an option to end a conversation where you have to give a reason to the person instead of getting a penalty. It should have at least 50 characters (I just picked a random number). This should be like a different button when you send a message. ""Message and unmatch.""
* You should see the description of a person first.
* Profiles have to have a description.
* There should be a limit of matches you can have at any given time. Your profile should disappear for everyone once you matched perhaps just 5 times.
* When you have less than 5 your profile is visible again.

I hope to reach a state where both women and men only get very few matches, and therefore they have to focus on these few matches a lot. You have to explain to the other person if they are not right for you. Other apps should be for hookups, while this app should aim at having a small customer base and its business mode should be to attract new customers through word of mouth.

When the app opens it should maybe start with the results of a study:

When people have the choice between six chocolates, they find it easy to find their preferred one and they are very happy with their choice afterwards. If they have to choose between 20 different chocolates they get choice paralysis and end up unhappier when they finally make a choice.

The name of the app could be Chocolate choice.

For the tech savvy:

* back to back encryption
* messages are not saved on private servers
* highly privatized

Edit: It is interesting to hear the more extreme opinions about such an app. The good thing is: You don't have to use it, and I am not going to blame you if you don't. I just want an alternative that works for me. It is supposed to be only for a niche of people.","Can tell you right now: I would not download your app because it‚Äôs so limiting and controlling, it wouldn‚Äôt be fun to use."

And many people will insult me but I don't care, and I'm not necessarily talking about suggar dating but in romantic relationships, men are more romantic, they don't care in general about the money or job that a woman has if she is attractive, women can attract dates much further than their league like millionaires or simply someone who has more money, studies, more interesting . And i dont talk not for me but in general, you can see it in any post or comment of any country.

I envy how women have more value than men, it is biology, and I talk about social class as I can talk about social skills, autism,height, etc. women have it better...a disabled woman has it better in dating than a man with that condition.

Why do men expect a woman who has a banging toned body from spending 6 hours a week in a gym, hair always done, nails painted, clear skin from weekly skin treatments and expensive lasers, trendy designer clothes, high heels, makeup done, lashes done, not a single hair on her face and body. That‚Äôs what my sister looks like because she doesn‚Äôt need to work and is able to afford to spend her time on her hobbies because her wealthy boyfriend takes care of the financial aspects of their lives. She looks like a model and heads turn to see her. 
Well guess what a woman working 2 jobs can not afford the time or money to do this and look like this. I know because I am a woman who‚Äôs lucky to be able to go to the gym once on the weekend and tend to go for fast food because I literally don‚Äôt have the time or the money, or the damn energy to have celery juice with a smoothie bowl for lunch and yet you men shame me for having fat on my body or blemishes on my skin. I can‚Äôt afford having my nails and hair done or skin treatments, I don‚Äôt have the time for makeup, I wake up at 6am. I am always looking tired and feeling grumpy because I‚Äôm overworked and overslept. But guess what I don‚Äôt care if you don‚Äôt have a penny, I don‚Äôt need a man for money.

You can‚Äôt expect to date a beauty queen who has a toned body and perfect skin and expect her to work 2 jobs. It‚Äôs not possible. You want the cake and eat it too. 
If you stopped going for women who want a wealthy man, and instead went for women who are far from perfect and could overlook her flaws, you would never have to complain about women being gold diggers but yet you go for stunning barbie dolls expecting to give nothing to them.

Go ahead honestly answer the question. You and I both know it‚Äôs not going to be the obese woman. Women don‚Äôt think the exact same way but wanting to and competing for the attractive guy is typical human behavior. Men compete for attractive women and women compete for attractive men.

Lots of men like white, lots of men like ethnic women. Plenty of men like short women, plenty of men like tall women.

But women are more uniform in terms of what they are mainly attracted to. They mainly prefer tall, white men, broad shoulders, with a strong jawline. 

Obviously, not all women can settle with a guy like but this seems to be what most women prefer. It makes OLD dating a miserable experience if you're not a man that meets those standards and it makes you feel completely undesirable. In most settings, I'm always insecure if there are taller guys around.  I know that if a woman sees me next to a taller guy, it will be a no-brainer who she prefers.

dating,elgssp,2020-01-07 20:01:30,Are men supposed to lower the bar a little bit?,"It just seems that our biology and society are set up in such a way that a man has to put in a fuck-ton of effort just to get any woman at all. At 24, I've dated nearly a dozen women, and I'm honestly baffled at how high that number is, considering my terrible economic situation. Not to mention that I have only ever had ***TWO*** crushes in my entire life: one I met in high school who rejected me (we were 20 at the time), and a co-worker who I went on 3 dates with that ended up ghosting me.

My point is, I see so many men who say they have found ""the one"", someone who is absolutely perfect. As if they have found their actual first choice in a woman. But I have no idea how I could afford to set the bar that high for myself. 

For example, I would LOVE a muscular woman who I think is a 10/10, is funny, has a sweet personality, and loves running, Star Wars, and metal. But I know that I have to be realistic. I'm trying to get with my FWB who has none of those interests.

If a man is a CEO, his SO might be an engineer. If a man is an engineer, his SO might be a schoolteacher. If a man is a schoolteacher, his SO might be an administrative assistant. If a man is an administrative assistant, his SO will have a minimum-wage job. If a man has a minimum-wage job, he's screwed unless he's in school or has some kind of good prospects.

Sadly, I'm 24, and my mental health is so fucked that I'm still being supported by my parents and might be in school until I'm about 30. People have told me that I should be going for someone a lot better than my FWB that I'm trying to get with. But I don't feel good enough to?","1. Work on yourself and your mental health before trying to date anyone.  This is for your own good, and also theirs.

2. Your perfect partner isn't going to share every interest that you have.  If you're lucky, you'll be attracted to each other, care about each other as people, and be open to learning about each other's interests because it's important to them.

To preface; Im 6‚Äô3 and passionate about gym, health and fitness. I have perfect hygiene and an athletic body, clear skin etc. the thing is, I‚Äôm bald, and i rate myself a 4/10 and have been described by numerous colleagues and strangers as ‚Äúa bit below average‚Äù, so I think 4/10 is appropriate. my face is just not that pretty, and I have droopy eyes. I‚Äôm 24 years old. I had only one girlfriend in the past who was I suppose around 8.5/10, she was a known model. She broke up with me because she found another guy, but our first six months she seemed in love. I have Aspergers so I don‚Äôt follow many social norms and as such I stand out as an extremely entertaining, cheerful fellow to everyone who meets me. My friends love my personality amd I‚Äôm liked everywhere I go. im not shallow at all, and value everyone on the content of their character, and am exceedingly agreeable. Looks are just important to me on an extremely deep level, I don‚Äôt know why, perhaps it‚Äôs because I need a mental assurance that I‚Äôve acquired compensation for what I so severely lack. Not that I‚Äôm entitled to compensation lol nobody is entitled to anything. Beautiful women just exert a magical force on me and I am spiritually addicted to that feeling and don‚Äôt want to let it go 

That ex girlfriend was three years ago. I‚Äôve been single ever since, and have been unable to attract any girls on that level at all. Everyone is telling me I have to lower my standards and give the unattractive girls a chance. I don‚Äôt want to. Just because I‚Äôm very unattractive doesn‚Äôt mean I want an unattractive partner. The ugly girls often have better personalities? Sure. But there are also hot girls out there with sweet personalities too, why can‚Äôt I have one of those? Why should I just accept that she would go to a handsome guy who did nothing to earn her attraction or his good looks? 

Looks are very important to me, but so is personality. I want both, and will not settle for less than both.

I fully accept looks are important to many hot girls too, so I understand many of them wouldn‚Äôt give me the time of day.

But I‚Äôm mentally just not going to accept that hot girls with sweet personality are inaccessible to me because I‚Äôm not ‚Äúin that league‚Äù. Fuck that. I got a model once I can do it again. I‚Äôm fine being alone, even for the rest of my life if necessary",You sound incredibly shallow. You also objectify the hell out of women.

I'm intelligent, funny, knowledgeable, generous, considerate, etc. However, I've never really valued higher education. I see it mostly as a way into debt. All the data shows that the ""you'll make a million more dollars in your lifetime with a degree"" is BS. Maybe with a post graduate degree, but even then it takes many years to pay off the loans for the degree, and you only net maybe $500K more in a lifetime. I'm not saying it's insignificant, but it's not a guarantee. I believe that debt is a real problem for most people with degrees.

All that said, I make a good living, have a house, nice car, etc. You'd probably guess that I have some sort of degree if you were to meet me. People are always surprised when I tell them that I only have certifications because that's all you really need in my field (IT). 

So, when I see women online that say things like, ""you must value education"", I think she must have a lot of debt (which I don't). I know that I can hang with them intellectually, but I don't think I want to be with someone with tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of student loan debt. Ironically, many of these women aren't even holding down decent jobs that pay more than what I make.

I also see the ""you must at least aspire to have a successful career"". What is a successful career? Being able to make a living despite paying off ridiculous student loan debts? Making it into the 1%? Blech

How many of you guys out there also think this way?",">So, when I see women online that say things like, ""you must value education"", I think she must have a lot of debt (which I don't).

Thats not all that smart of an assessment. So I'm not so certain you can actually hang with these women. 

First off- their parents could've paid for their education. Or they could've gone community college first or they could've even had scholarships. 

Or maybe they are just referring to their own personal lifetime of learning. Libraries are free dawg.

dating,v8c5bj,2022-06-09 08:31:02,I think the system of online dating is just built against men.,"i‚Äôm going to start by saying i don‚Äôt think it was in any way intentional and meant to hurt men, but i do still think it puts you guys at a disadvantage. (also feel free to correct me if i‚Äôm wrong on any of this i haven‚Äôt looked this stuff up in ages) also this is for dating, not hooking up

so let‚Äôs start by talking about how men and women form bonds in general. i want to make it clear not every person will fall into either or box, as well as the existence of nonbinary ppl (which online dating ROYALY fucks). Generally speaking men and women are at least socialized differently when it comes to emotions and relationships.

men form relationships based on shared interest, and looks (this isn‚Äôt inherently bad fellas dw). in friendships men more easily bond with other guys who like what they like. they grow closer by sharing these activities with one another. when finding a partner their initial draw based on how they look also plays a large role. 

women form relationships based on shared emotion/experiences and looks. in friendships women bond by sharing emotions and time with those around them. looks definitely play a role in relationships but it can often fall into a secondary position. 

on dating apps all you have to go off of is pictures of people and their bio/questions (which lets face it bios in general can only tell so much). women have more higher quality pictures available than most men. it‚Äôs just not really the social norm to see guys who take sexy and cute pictures of themselves like it is for women. bios are also a pain for most people but many guys either don‚Äôt put in the effort or simply don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs appealing or appropriate to put which again goes into how men socially don‚Äôt do a lot of talking about themselves and generally aren‚Äôt expected to in their circles. 

when men get on a dating app they will be drawn to looks primarily and bio and all of that secondarily (tbh this is mostly from being around college age guy friends and trying to help them get matches so sorry if it isn‚Äôt super accurate here feel free to help me out). obviously a woman having a bio can help a guy in making a choice but generally the appearance is what does it. 

women do go for looks too. let‚Äôs not ignore it. but if a bio is really good bad pictures can be overlooked (i really think style, confidence, and good photography can help most people). also if someone is previewed as attractive but as a bad bio or no bio they might not swipe at all. if there is a match and the communication isn‚Äôt solid, or the woman doesn‚Äôt feel emotionally connected then she will probably end it. 

since women generally have better quality pictures of themselves, and detailed bios men are more likely to swipe. women are less likely to swipe because they find the lack of bios and quality photos insufficient. so women are getting more matches then men, but then once messaging starts it is again hard. women expect a very specific emotional connection and if they don‚Äôt feel it how it‚Äôs needed they will move on. 

literally this could all be wrong but i kind of thought it was interesting. this may not apply to some older folks dating since i am basing this off of the experiences of ppl 18-28 and their dating habits. it‚Äôs not fool proof in anyway. i genuinely don‚Äôt think men are at fault. the system just happens favor ppl who have quality photos, average looking, and have a good understanding of themselves and how to communicate it. i think that how men and women generally approach making bonds also puts them a bit at odds here sometimes

anyway thanks for reading this wall of text","It's built for women because women are the bait that it needs for men to enter.

In general women will select for the best guy available and with online dating the best guy available is the best guy on the app. Not the best guy at the given time and place but the best guy in 100km radius over the last 24 hours."

dating,12bri6q,2023-04-04 18:15:29,This sub surely isn't a reflection on today's dating reality?,"I'm reading the comments, and I'm dumbfounded. Has OLD really reshaped the dating market that much? I've been back on the market for 6 months, and this sub alone made me delete all the dating apps. I've been brainwashed. It was only like 10 years ago you'd meet people offline and take what you could get in your local areas. 

What the hell is wrong with you lot? Have you not seeked advice from your parents? who probably had you in their 20s?","Don‚Äôt want to sound defeatist and insinuate that it‚Äôs hopeless, but online dating definitely has reshaped the dating world. The reason people aren‚Äôt seeking advice from their parents is because the dating landscape is completely different than it was when they were on the market. 

Once upon a time, a man only had to compete with the few guys in the office or at church or wherever. Now they‚Äôre competing with basically every other single guy within a 50 mile radius. Most men do not rank well in a range that wide and a lot of men are being ‚Äúpriced out‚Äù of the dating market in a sense.

Of course you could just delete the apps but even so the presence of social media and the fact that other people still use the apps will always present the ‚Äúcompetition‚Äù back to your doorstep. Even if you don‚Äôt use them, it‚Äôs very hard to escape the effects they generate."

He was nice, but I didn‚Äôt feel attracted to him. He kept telling me that I was extremely beautiful and his type, and touched me on the arm an upwards of 20 times, which is the most I‚Äôve ever been touched by a stranger.

I felt kind of bad that I didn‚Äôt want to date him, and so I told him I didn‚Äôt feel a romantic connection but asked him if he wanted to be friends. He said he felt the same romantically but didn‚Äôt see us  as friends. 

I had to ask him why he kept touching me! It felt super weird as I didn‚Äôt reciprocate once! He told me he didn‚Äôt want to do an analysis of the date, and I responded that I just meant on the arm, but no problem best wishes, and he told me he didn‚Äôt want to engage with me at all. I said ‚Äúhaha okay sorry, best wishes with dating!‚Äù which was totally ignored.

The above was communicated in 7 messages total from both of us over 1-2 minutes, so I wasn‚Äôt spamming him/wouldn‚Äôt message again.

dating,pqew0u,2021-09-18 03:26:38,Was I wrong to call my tinder match immature?,"I (26M) was just swiping a few nights ago and I got a match (25F). I looked at her profile and she was attractive, but I just didn't get a good feeling about her personality. Her bio and pics kind of gave off a gold-digger/perpetual college student vibe. I figured that I could be wrong though, so I just straight up asked her out. I usually go with a local taco shop, a farmers market ice cream stand, or something similar for a first date, but because of my first impression, I just decided to ask her out to Taco Bell instead. I figured that if she really was looking for an expensive first date she'd just say no, and if she didn't take herself too seriously and was down to just have a fun chat at the Bell she'd say yes. I don't remember the exact wording since it was yesterday and I've since been blocked, but the conversation went something like this.   


Me: ""Hey, I'm thinking about going to Taco Bell tonight. Want to go?""  


Her: ""I hope you're joking.""  


Me: ""Haha, nah. Why?""  


Her: ""You asked me out on a date to Taco Bell. We are ADULTS.""  


At this point I knew it wasn't going to happen. I'm an adult, I try to stay in shape, and I try to eat healthy, but I'm not above swinging by for a classic crunchwrap every other Friday night.   


Me: ""Yeah, maybe, but I just didn't get that vibe from your profile.""


Her: ""Are you calling me immature?!?""


Me: ""Well, since you asked...  yeah, pretty much.""  


Her: ""You literally don't even know me! Who are you to judge?!? \[and she went on to write 7 more paragraphs of basically this before blocking me\]



Maybe I was a little harsh, but when a global pandemic shut down my hometown and plunged the world into chaos Taco Bell was always there for me. They never let me down. 


TL:DR; I asked a girl out to Taco Bell, she implied that adults don't go there, I implied that she wasn't acting like one.",You are definitely immature. What a stupid thing to do. She's dodged a bullet with you.
dating,moki68,2021-04-11 04:44:20,Dating as a woman is exhausting because it feels like I have to do all the work all the time.,"It‚Äôs really hard and tiring to date as a woman. Let me explain. There are three main reasons why it‚Äôs hard to date men as a woman. 

First off, they always pass up women who are deemed as ‚Äòugly‚Äô even if those women have showered and have great hygiene and clothing. Then they proceed to complain about women not coming up to them when plenty of women probably do, they just turn down the unattractive ones who aren‚Äôt good enough. 

Second off, they‚Äôre always complaining about how women never have to put any effort in at all. This is a lie, however, as an ugly woman myself, I‚Äôm always the one putting in all the effort, only to get turned down. So maybe if guys didn‚Äôt turn down the women who did ask them out, they‚Äôd actually get a date. 

Third off, and finally, guys always ghost on OLD. From my first hand experiences, we women always have to message first and then we never get a reply back. I‚Äôd know. Men on this site like to complain that women always get multiple messages on OLD but this is of course, a lie. They‚Äôre just picky, ghosting assholes, who perpetuate this idea that women get multiple messages a day so they don‚Äôt have to own up to the fact that at the end of the day, they‚Äôre picky jerks who are looking for models instead of normal people.",Women do get more matches and messages OLD than men of the same level of attractiveness. Is this sarcastic?

My dad is paying for my university and I can‚Äôt do much about it. Back in my home country he‚Äôs a good dad. I‚Äôve got a boyfriend abroad and we haven‚Äôt kissed yet, we‚Äôre taking things slow, but I wanna know if I should tell him about this. (My dad would also occasionally put a hand on my thigh and hold hands while driving in the car.) (I‚Äôm not living with him so it‚Äôs not bad.) What would this look like from a guys perspective? And how long into the relationship should I let him know?

Edit: he pays for the entire family and I‚Äôm from a culture where even dating is quite taboo. 
Moreover it‚Äôs kinda a lingering kiss and not a peck‚Ä¶ I wonder if it‚Äôs normal in other cultures?
Also I can‚Äôt talk to my mom about this, she‚Äôll tell him.","Talk to your mom about this before you talk to your boyfriend‚Ä¶ I think in some culture kissing on the lips is normal but since you are asking advice about it then it means that it‚Äôs not normal.

dating,x1ngsp,2022-08-30 16:25:41,How do I (22F) ask my bf (23M) to use dildos/penis sleeves on me without hurting his feelings?,"*Trigger warring this is NSFW*

I absolutely love my current bf. He‚Äôs smart and caring and one of the best communicators I‚Äôve ever met. He‚Äôs so charismatic and I could listen to him talk about anything. 

The only problem is that the sexual chemistry between us isn‚Äôt that great. He‚Äôs very attentive and does his best, but he isn‚Äôt really ‚Äúbig enough‚Äù for me to orgasm during sex and sadly all clit stimulation does is give me the sensation that I need to pee. 

I feel terrible about this because I‚Äôd say he‚Äôs right around average (6 inches and yes we measured out of curiosity), but after being with someone significantly larger (have no idea how big but the orgasms were mind blowing) average doesn‚Äôt really do it for me anymore. 

I‚Äôm debating whether or not to ask him to incorporate a dildo/penis sleeve in the bedroom so I can get that ‚Äúfull feeling again‚Äù but I don‚Äôt know how to do it without hurting his feelings. 

Tl;dr: My (22f) boyfriend (23m) has an average dick and can‚Äôt get me to orgasm so I‚Äôm trying to find a way to incorporate toys without hurting his feelings.

dating,13uvnj0,2023-05-29 13:56:02,AI will disrupt the dating world,"Hey, Redditers! Just a thought I've been thinking on lately. AI is really shaking up the dating game. I mean, the kind of tools popping up right now, they're game changers. I've been hearing that a load of guys are already onboard, and honestly, I can't blame 'em. The tools give great reply suggestions, with slang, emojis and flirty jokes.   
As a guy, texting is extremely time consuming because the standarts from girls are very high. Because of dating apps, they are bombarded with attention that has never been seen before. If you make one texting mistake, the girl will go away because she has another 10 guys texting her. As a man, don't want to waste time on texting, because it's something way more different than a live conversation. So here comes the AI to help, it's becoming great and I save a bunch of time that I would spend thinking of replies, so I could do activities, that actually improve my value as a man (which at the end of the day girls appreciate the most, right?).   


I feel that online dating made things for men way more difficult. AI could even things out once again.

dating,12nm9cr,2023-04-15 23:07:30,Why the male/female imbalance exists on dating websites,"  

I hear about how there is a massive imbalance in the male to female ratio on dating websites. I am curious why this. I would like to hear your opinions on the following factors and any ideas of your own why this imbalance exists 

\*Women receive nasty messages from oddballs. Below is what someone on reddit wrote about their experiences on dating apps

‚ÄúI haven't used dating apps in a number of years, but when I was on them, I got a lot of sexually explicit messages along with insults and occasionally rape threats. Probably at least half my messages beyond ""hi"" contained that type of content. When I messaged men, some of them seemed angry that I messaged them. Anecdotally, it seems that my friends who are more conventionally attractive get less of that, possibly because men are more interested in having actual relationships with them.

I don't have any hard evidence of this, but my hypothesis is that this type of behavior drives many of the less attractive women off of the sites. If this is true, the consequence of this would be that there are fewer women who are willing to match with less attractive men. I also wonder if less attractive women are less likely to sign up in the first place, fearing that dating sites will simply be a microcosm of how they are treated in the rest of the world.‚Äù

\*Women are more content being single than men whilst men are far less content and the desire to find a partner is stronger in men.

\*Women can find partners without resorting using to the internet whilst it is harder for men to find other methods of finding partners.

\*Are women worried about safety if they meet strangers from the internet.","Women are worried about their safety all the time, not just meeting strangers on the internet. We know that not all men are bad, but we have all had at least 1 experience of a man doing something unwanted or straight up threatening/assaulting."

Sometimes, I feel I don‚Äôt deserve love ..","Probably the best thing you could do for yourself is set higher boundaries and lower your expectations. 

You can find a decent man out there very easily who will love you for your heart and mind and not your body. 
Sometimes you just need to stop looking at the ones who give you too much attention to see them. 

What you may need is a man who understands these boundaries and that it should be up to you on whether or not they can have your body and still be able t function as a partner outside of that. 

Try friendship first and see where that goes."

dating,11bzjq5,2023-02-25 23:46:27,"40 year old, childless woman can't get a date","I am a 40 year old woman, am told I am attractive, have a decent career as a teacher, no kids, can't have kids. I'm active and play sports, but am also feminine. I stopped dating for years because of fear of rejection in regards to infertility and I wanted to work on my mental health so I could attract others who were mentally well or trying to be. Last year, I decided to dive back into dating casually. 

I have a hard time getting dates. I have no problem getting someone willing to have sex with me. But I don't want these FWB situations. I want a real relationship. I rarely get matches on dating apps and when I do, and express that I am ultimately looking for a relationship, I get ghosted or the man has several young children or doesn't even have a car, which would make me the chauffer. 

Men with children are offended I don't want to date them, but I work with children and know what they need and I don't want to get into dramatic crossfire of baby mama or other complications. They didn't have to have children with a woman that they couldn't stick with. 

I understand women may have this complex that men are trash and will never be good enough, but I honestly don't believe that. 

Just have a goddam car, job, be active and healthy, honest, and think of women as more than a sex toy. 

I actually have a lot of contempt for many women because they make themselves readily available to men and so men don't have to put in any effort, and they aren't looking for relationships. I mean, it makes sense because if you can get all of the benefits without having to commit to anything inconvenient, then just don't. 

I'm lonely, I don't have family, and I don't have any true friends. I am in a very dark place. I feel like I am going to die alone. 

If there are so many lonely people out there then why are they just looking for sexual partners or babysitters? Where are people that want real connections and relationships?","There are guys out there who would be good for you, unfortunately, they aren‚Äôt common. It‚Äôs just the truth that most men your age have had at least one child by now. The majority of the remainders are playboy types. What‚Äôs left, after all that, are the types of guys women just don‚Äôt want. That‚Äôs why they don‚Äôt have baggage from previous relationships or have a bunch of casual sex. Women don‚Äôt want romantic or sexual relationships with them.


Even at 26, I feel like most people my age are either already hitched, still casual only, or forever alone."
dating,10tgo5w,2023-02-04 13:41:21,my only requirement in a partner is undying loyalty.,"I'm 28 f. African American, 130 lbs and 5'3. I have a warm and open personality but at times I can be self loathing and over critical of myself and others. I'm not always dependable but I make it a point to follow my word if I give it. I'm very adventurous and am also a bit reserved. I don't care too much about my looks but I do value my intelligence. As it's something that can't be disproven. Looks are too subjective. 

As of this year I'm going on 5 years of not having had one long term relationship. In that time I've had two kids. The first being with my last of my only two long term adult relationships. My second child was with a friend from high school who turned into a fb. Neither are in mine or my children's lives. 

Anyway my longest relationship in these 5 years was 4 weeks. Any other attempt failed after the first day. And I can count on one hand the amount of times I tried and came close to starting a relationship but then quickly realizing it would never be.

So I know I'm the problem but after 5 years of soul searching and trying to physically and mentally improve myself I've realized that my attempts are futile. So is that it ? Am I just going to be single for the rest of my life because I'm too flawed of a human being for anyone to settle down with? I can clearly see myself at 38 still alone and when I was 18 I said I'll probably be single in ten years and I was right. So I know I'm not being dramatic. 

I want advice. I don't want to be alone. And for the record I don't need a man to validate me or take care of me. I'm just a human woman who is lonely and wanting a life mate. Someone to wake up to and make love to. Someone to travel with and build with. And I don't want to feel guilty about that or be told that I need to focus on myself and enjoy being single. Cause frankly I don't buy that. If that were the case then everyone in the world should be single. 

Anyway I already know that according to the men of Reddit since I'm old and have kids that I'm damaged goods and shouldn't expect to attract anyone. But if anyone else who has an open mind has advice or success or failure stories I'm all ears","28 isn't old, but as a man I don't think I would be the first one in line to date a single mother with two kids with two different fathers.

dating,10564pr,2023-01-06 21:30:10,Dating models / influencers - Question about being superficial,"I'm just wondering about something and I'd like to hear your thoughts. Before I explain, I want to preface this post with one thing:

Serious dating isn't really that important to me at the moment. I love flirting just for the fun aspect of it, but I'm not planning on getting into a serious relationship due to some issues I need to fix first. You know, priorities. So now that's out of the way, here's what I'm wondering:

Are there any people here who got together with a model? I mean people who post their pics on instagram for example. In general I'd like to read about your experiences. How was it like to begin the conversation, how was it during the relationship if you got to that point etc. Was it difficult? Was it annoying? Was it better than you imagined? Or... there was not much difference at all?

The reason why I'm asking is because I'm a fairly superficial person. I agree about the fact that personality and chemistry are the most important things for the relationship to last long term... but I would lie if I said looks don't matter to me. Physical appearance and body type matters to me quite a lot. I'm the ""*I know what I want*"" type of a person. Even though it is a bit hurtful, I'm not giving people as much of a chance as I would if they met my physical criteria. I'm aware this approach limits me a bit but I also just don't want to lie to myself and to other people. You know? If I don't feel attracted to someone, I'm not going to pretend I am, because I believe that's even worse.

I realise this question is a bit pointless since humans are very complicated and labeling a group of people (*In this case conventionally ""hot"" people*) is unfair, but I'd still like to read your thoughts. Just as a way to expand my own internal horizon.","The fact that so many folks on this sub care to know about other people's lives so much is part of the ""fixing"" we need to do.

I haven‚Äôt put myself out there yet due to me feeling that I would be rejected for not having much that would make me worth dating.","Wrong question. Many people think this way and self reject. People's life experiences program them to value qualities in others. No two people are going to value the same thing in a potential partner equally since experiences are different. 

Better questions would be:
- Which current qualities/hobbies of mine do I believe are interesting? 
- How should I communicate well when talking to new people? 
- What kind of a relationship do I want? How do I communicate that?
- What kind of a person would make a great partner? Which qualities are okay to compromise on and which absolutely aren't? 
- Where would I be most comfortable socializing with people?

Basic human decency rules apply -- having boundaries, respecting other people's boundaries, basic hygiene, etc."

So I'm a 21 yr old girl in college, pretty attractive (if i do say so myself), very outgoing, great social life, have lots of interests and hobbies, and (rlly not trying to brag but it relates to my issue) guys tend to like me very intensely very quickly. I'm almost a bit too used to having male attention, which has made my ego skyrocket, along with my standards. This all may sound great, but it has It's completely ruined my romantic/sex life and has gotten to the point to where I turn guys down in my head just by taking one look at them. I've grown to be so independent and sure of what I was over the 21 years i've been completely on my own, that now I can't even imagine being that intimate with someone and my fundamental attraction has become so narrow I don't give any guys a chance. I've only had sex with one guy one time, and I liked him a lot at first, but by the second time I hung out with him I was so turned off and repulsed by things he did that I was an asshole and just ghosted him like I do with everyone else. At first I thought I was just picky and knew what I wanted in a man, but now its just getting a bit sad and I'm really worried I'll never find anyone that lives up to the ideal man I imagine myself with. I'm not too analytical when it comes to attraction and connection, I meet people and can usually tell right off the bat if there's a connection or not, so if i feel it I feel it, if i dont I dont. I dont think too much about it. But basically every guy I meet I find something wrong with him or don't feel that organic attraction. 

I'm happy being alone, when you've been completely single (especially with only 1 sexual experience) you kinda get used to it and don't think about it too much day to day. But of course like everyone else, I get lonely at times and think about what it feels like to be in love and be so close to someone and always have them right there when you need them. And to be loved. I just want to experience what its like just one time, but it always seems impossible and out of reach. I'm sure itll prolly happen one day, but jesus its been so fuckin long. I feel like maybe I have issues I need to deal with or something. 

What do you guys think? Anyone else share a similar experience?",">But basically every guy I meet I find something wrong with him or don't feel that organic attraction.

You know that saying. If you meet one random person and they're an asshole, usually means, they're an asshole. If every single person you meet in life is an asshole, you're the asshole. 

There's something in your psyche that is turned off by any man. You'll never be happy, like a person dying of thirst surrounded by water. You need to sort that out first."

dating,xh31ao,2022-09-18 01:08:06,When your bf makes a rape joke--how would you respond?,"If the person you're dating made a casual joke about raping you, would you shut down the relationship immediately?

Basically, bf said, out of nowhere while we were alone, ""You're so attractive, I could rape you.""

I had an ex that said something similar, in that case I responded that it was not okay, and asked him not to make comments like that again, which resolved the problem. However, I feel like it was a predictor of how I was treated later (i.e., lack of respect).

So in this case, I respond a bit more harshly. I backed away and was like, ""What did you say? Do you WANT to rape me?"" He got flustered and lied to my face and said he said some other word, but then admitted that's what he said. Said he had  ""dark sense of humor"" and didn't mean anything by it.

EDIT: Ended things with this guy. Thank you everyone for your advice.","Yeah, it's an immediate shut down. No normal person brings up rape like that in a normal conversation.

I've been on dates with some nice guys but nothing has worked out and initially I thought it was ok and that I was just learning from those experiences, and one day I'd meet someone and it would click if I kept trying. But now after hearing people talk about this, I'm wondering if I should be concerned about ""all the good guys being gone""? In my own life, I know lots of amazing single girls but all of the good guys I know are in relationships. All the single guys I know are problematic for one reason or another. I'm worried that the guys who are single now are just the ""leftovers"" (someone else's wording but it made me anxious) and I missed my chance to be in a healthy relationship with someone who I'm actually interested in.

I know rationally that this isn't true, but I'm still scared that each time I go on a date with a nice guy and it doesn't work out, that's one less in an already limited number of options because of my age and lack of experience. Is this completely untrue? Are there still nice single guys in their late 20s? Some people have made it sound like there aren't and it makes me want to just give up. Is there hope?

dating,wk543v,2022-08-09 14:43:16,Conservative marriage,"I‚Äôm a (21f) and I just recently told my friends that I‚Äôm conservative. They are liberals and Democrats so they disagree with this. I told them the reason that I am conservative is because I value Hardwork, I value men and the role they play in society, and I wanna be a good woman to the man that I marry and so many other things that come along with being conservative. I tried explaining my conservative views to the best of my abilities.My friends are ‚Äúmodern women‚Äú and they don‚Äôt value anything especially men. They expect men to give them money pay their rent and they don‚Äôt have to lift a finger they don‚Äôt cook, clean, or nurture their partner. they sit around smoke weed all day and post half naked pictures on social media. I told them that‚Äôs not the type of woman I wanna be anymore. I‚Äôm celibate I‚Äôve been celibate for around six months now. I have no desire to give my body to a man with no intentions of getting married. I was secretly conservative for 2 years and I‚Äôve been slowly making changes to my life. With the way that I dress, and the way that I present myself to men. I‚Äôve had my fair share of hook ups and honestly I‚Äôm done. I‚Äôve never even been in a relationship. Every guy I‚Äôve been with only wants to have sex with me. And it‚Äôs because of how I have presented myself to them. They don‚Äôt value me they don‚Äôt think that I am worth dating. I‚Äôm nothing more than just a hook up to a lot of the men that know me. It‚Äôs heartbreaking to know that I‚Äôm not worth anything to the men around me because I was so quick to give them my body. when I look at my future I want to be a valuable woman. I wanna to get married someday and have a healthy one. A marriage that is built on values, trust, morals and so many other things, I talked with an older lady who I work with she‚Äôs been married for over 50 years I asked her what makes her marriage last so long she told me a clean house, food on the table, and sex I agree with her. I think it‚Äôs sad that it took me this long to value myself and men. My friends think that I‚Äôm going to become a slave to my future husband. I try to make them understand the importance of following a man‚Äôs lead especially a hard-working levelheaded man who will never put your life or his life in danger. But will make decisions to enhance the both of your lives. Will do things that will benefit the both of you a man that has your best interest at heart. But they think that I‚Äôm making a horrible decision with my life. I don‚Äôt wanna lose my friends but I want them to understand that this is not a decision that they get to make for me.","I‚Äôm similar to you so I understand where you are coming from. I‚Äôve become more conservative and the wellness of family is so important to me, but we have to be smart. 

The advice that the older women gave you was good. It will be important when you do find the right guy. 

But you need to remember that lady comes from a different generation. Just like your friends are modern women, most men are also modern men. Less men want to be providers, positively masculine, and live based on certain values. So be careful. As women, we often get so caught up in waiting for Prince Charming. So when a decent guy shows up we think he‚Äôs the one. Don‚Äôt fall too easily. People lie and manipulate. People also change. You‚Äôll have to weave through a lot of frogs before finding a prince. Especially with the guys in our generation. And even the Prince won‚Äôt be exactly how you dream.

As for your friends, who cares. You can still be friends but have different beliefs. Just don‚Äôt let them sway your morals. But if they can‚Äôt accept the person you now are, maybe you should move on from them."

dating,u0qi6y,2022-04-10 20:40:21,Went on a date with a Doctor who is racist,"So I went on a date with a male doctor (38) and I was literally speechless with his ignorance and racism. He's half white and half Chinese but looks Chinese as in you couldn't tell he's mixed race. He told me he's into South asian women as then laughed and shared with me like I would be happy.. he finds them super exotic. Exotic is deemed as a racist outlook to women of colour as it shows beauty standards that are seemed normal is Caucasian. Anything that doesn't fit these norms, people say exotic which is offensive. What shocked me more, he has only dated south Asians and has many south asian friends. Second part of the date which I found really offensive, he kept saying I am fair for a south asian and he couldn't believe I wasn't mixed. Again another ignorant comment which I did politely reply saying you can't generalise a race on colour alone. I think I was just taken back on his ridiculous comments especially as he's a doctor. He's not my type but I wanted to be open minded to go on a date but I think it was clear after the constant comments about being exotic and fair, I wish I was brave enough to just leave but as I didn't want to be rude, I subjected myself to a very long uncomfortable evening. I left the date making sure I paid 50% and hope to never see him again.

I would think that would be the opposite.

The best advice I can give is that you need to go tunnel vision on your favorite hobbies and put it in front of everyone possible. Learn to shred guitar, or skateboard, practice your writing, get into wood working or welding or cars/bikes. Learn to paint. Start DM'ing DnD games. 

Find your niche and go absolutely ham on it. And then get on social media and share tf out of your passions and skills with your peers. 

If all you focus on is girls you're gonna get someone you don't want or loose your mind over someone that doesn't matter. Show everyone what you're about and a girl with similar interests will pop up in front of you.

But also never be afraid of rejection. If you like someone set your intentions then shoot straight. Honesty straight forwardness and confidence will get you through a hell of a lot more than you'd think. But you already know that if you're learning to walk. Stay strong and keep building speed bro.

I don't really want someone I need to talk to every day. Or to see them multiple times a week. I'm really quite busy with work, then working out, plus my hobbies and extra business I'm trying to start.

Does such a thing exist? I understand this is sort of what ""FWB"" is supposed to be but my understanding is a man needs to be a tall ripped/beautiful supermodel to get one of those or just ridiculously lucky. I dunno.

Or maybe you need a sugar baby for it. 

Does such a thing exist in normal dating?

We were taking a bath at a remote beach with no one about. She seemed concious about her own body. She told me she needed to loose some weight. Thats a little unsettling. I dont think she needs to loose weight at all. She is slim enough as she is. We both probably would benefit from getting more in shape. She dont have this perfect porn star body but I dont care about that. She is way above average both with her body, her smile, skin tone, personality and she knows how to dress well. She dont use makeup and she dont need to. I would still show her off to my friends. She got nothing to worry about. I think maybe we should work out together and get in shape both of us.

dating,p1xvkh,2021-08-10 20:44:00,Why do Women (generally speaking) consider 6 packs to be attractive?," 

I am a straight Man, age 25, but even straight people can recognize someone attractive in their gender. And I just don't understand why most Women are into abs.

Now I admit part of it could be rooted in me not having abs. But I never bothered getting them because I never found them appealing. Quite the opposite. I find that body builder appearance fake and unatural. I think it is important to be healthy yes. I for example don't drink pop / alcohol, don't smoke. ride my bike and jog a lot, use stairs instead of elevators, not drive short distances, etc. I lead a healthy a lifestyle. Still overweight for some reason but working on it; trying to go from a belly (I look pregnant LOL) to something closer to 'normal' (a 'dad bod' I think it is called)

Personally, I am more attracted to Women who are smart and successful, Women with good morals, and Women who are Motherly, than Women who are physically attractive. Likewise, if I was a Woman, I'd be attracted to Men who are smart and successful, with good morals, and are Fatherly over Men who are physically attractive. But to me, a superficially / physically attractive Man is someone with certain physical features (many of which I don't have so this is not a 'cope') but a 6-pack is not one of them. I find that repulsive as it looks fake and unnatural. Healthy weight, yes is attractive (I admit I am much more attractive with my shirt on). But a 6-pack, I just don't see the appeal. And definitely don't see the appeal with a body builder's body. All those extra muscles just repeal me due to looking unnatural.","Do you find breasts attractive? A beautiful ass? Full lips? Clear, large, bright eyes? It‚Äôs the equivalent for (straight) women finding men with nice abs attractive. It‚Äôs primal. Are women with an ounce of depth going to value a six pack over other attributes? Probably not.

ETA: Bodybuilder physique is *not* attractive. Fitness and non-cartoonish musculature, attractive."

I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs right, or fair, or even that it applys to every scenario. Just‚Ä¶ this is how it has been for a long time. 

And this may be a bit controversial, but that‚Äôs why females are taught to have a huge focus on their looks from a young age, and guys are taught to do manly shit, like take risks, show courage, and lead romantic encounters. 

I‚Äôm sick of both sides not understanding the other sides pressure. Like approaching girls is a rough gig, while making sure you look perfect everyday and feeling insecure if you don‚Äôt is also a fucking rough gig (for girls).

I didn‚Äôt expect her but to my surprise she asked for her Instagram and she told me that the girl said I was funny and cool, and that she would add my friend and I could add her from there.

They never exchanged information and the cringey part was that I THINK, I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs actually her,  but I think I found her IG and sent in a follower request, but didn‚Äôt get a follow back. So I‚Äôm guessing she doesn‚Äôt like me which is fine, we were cordial and I would try to make her laugh when I did work there, but it was embarrassing to see her again. Usually I‚Äôm pretty good about shooting my shot, but I hate running into girls I‚Äôve gone out on dates in the past, or girls I‚Äôve asked out before (even if they said yes or no). 

We just said hi to each other and that was pretty much it, I‚Äôm probably not going to try to talk to her again and I don‚Äôt regret asking her out, but it‚Äôs just a reminder of being rejected. 

And my friends and I have a pretty good saying, we never clown on any of us when we go to ask out girls, and the saying is ‚Äúshooters gotta shoot.‚Äù It‚Äôs basically saying if you gotta take chances in order to have a chance of success, but in this situation I feel like it backfired.

I am a 37 yo transwoman, interested in men or women. Despite being a bit along in my transition and looking really cute and getting a lot of compliments, I struggle to find real dates and partners. I have tried dating apps (Tinder, OK Cupid, Plenty of Fish) and while the attention is flattering, they either just want some weird online thing where we never meet, or they just want a discreet hookup, which I am not open to. Basically, they won't be seen with me in public. It is really frustrating. I am also a more introverted type, I don't drink, and most of the game groups/clubs I am in are filled with couples, really hard to find singles. I haven't had a real, in-person romantic encounter in over 2 years and it is getting a bit unbearable. I had an online thing end recently that left me kinda hurt and feeling more lonely than ever (we had a meeting date setup, but it won't happen now). This is kind of a vent, but also, does anyone have any suggestions or words of encouragement?","Have you tried any queer dating apps or even lgbtq+ social groups in your area? Are you living in a rural, suburban or urban area? If you're in a small town, I'd honestly consider moving somewhere with a bigger population.

dating,o5hoxe,2021-06-22 07:59:07,Why are there a million dating sites for BBW but no good ones for big dudes.,"I just wanna put this out there and see what's said. I'm a 41 year old 6'2"" 275 to 290 depending on the day guy. I have been looking on line trying to find someplace that is directed to guys like me. I know there are women out there that like us big dudes but there isn't really a place I have found. If I'm wrong pl ease let me know. I have spent weeks actually months looking. Signed up for a hundred sites that seem like maybe but it always turns out to really be for bbw. I have no problem with bbws having places for them to find a guy. I get it I'm in same boat but it's extremely one sided from what I have seen. Why can't a big dude have someplace to find love too shit. I know for a fact that there alot more ladies out there that like them some big men. They don't have to be bbw or any other crazy acronym. Just normal everyday every size every walk of life women. Listen us big guys already get enough bad looks and stuff said behind our back that hurts. We already have to find clothes in big and tall or something like it. We have to squeeze into tiny airplane seats or cars. We already get the calls from friends to help move heavy shit all the time. We deal with a lot of shit most ""normal guys"" don't. Do you have any idea how hard it is to see good women with piece of shit ""normal guys"" because thats what they think they want and it's socially acceptable. I'll tell you this right now. Most of us big guys are way better human beings with bigger hearts and would be able to protect way better then these gym rats"" I did 1000 crunches today"". Good for you I ate 20 tacos today and can still out lift you. Wait wait wait ok I'm sounding negative toward them. If they like to work out more power to them. The ones I don't like are the ones that think they are God's gift and that they deserve to play women for fool and treat them like trash. So please except my apology decent gym rats lol. I'm just saying while the bad ones are lifting weights to attract more women they will just ruin for the rest of us.  Shit half the time those guys are smaller then the burrito I just ate. Look I know I'm not perfect I know my shape isn't the ideal model build but I guarantee any lady I'm with will have a smile on her face all day everyday if she would legitimately give it a chance. Most of us are that way. I get we may not be chiseled out of stone and have always been frowned on as unhealthy dirty sweaty and smelly. That's just not true for most of us. I am aware that I sweat after a hard day at work so take another shower it's not rocket science. Fact is that the way we get looked at treated and shunned by people just shows that we are not the ugly ones those of you who look at us disgusted those of you who snicker behind our back (which we hear clearly). Those of you who think your to good to give us a chance. Especially those of you who think you are any kind of better then we are. You my friends you are the ugly disgusting ones. Your the ones that give people depression problems, self esteem issues, cause good loving caring human beings commit suicide, and destroy the happiness of countless people that are 1000000 times better humans then you ever will be. But hey what do I know I'm just a lonely fat dude trying to find a site to maybe find love like everyone else has. Yet again for some reason there isn't. That's my rant let's see what's happens. If you read this far thanks for the time. Ladies give big guys a chance we won't let you down just sayin.","Lmao I knew it would get mainly negative feed back.  Maybe your right and I am a shitty person and nobody has ever done the things I said. It's all just fabricated and it doesn't happen. I'm the bad guy because I have been treated poorly by people and I'm the jerk because people doing things like I said have made me bitter towards people. Oh and of course how can I forget to properly type a statement using great grammar. Big guys don't get treated the same as others most of the time. Ask them really how people treat them honestly and not just what they tell you. I just went on a date 2 days ago and the girl seemed awesome till it started. We got a lyft ride to go to our destination and she literally hit on the driver and said and I quote"" damn your sexy, oh no don't worry about him. We just met and he is way to big for me."" ( then laughed) and proceeded to get his number. On top of it we still went and I was stuck with women that proceeded to belittle me as the night went on. The whole time I was smiling and tried to just let it go and ended up staying the whole time. Which was actually a good thing because I got to ride home with her puking on me and telling me was glad she got wasted because it made the date go faster. I never did anything to deserve that and I have known this girl for a little while and she asked me out. I was surprised and excited to go. She made me think that hey maybe this will work out. Then made me feel like fat trash. So you tell me you think I'm the only guy this has happened to because I'm not. Yeah she was a bad apple but do you know how many of those there are. It's happened a few times and I know you won't believe this but I don't deserve it. I'm a very caring honest loyal person and I try to be kind to everyone. I go out of my way to do so. Because when I look back at my life I want to know I treated everyone I came across the best I could. Them turning mean is not something I provoke. So like I said I was venting and sorry if anyone took it the wrong way. We don't get treated or looked at the same. Maybe nobody sees it or can believe it but this world is filled with people that would rather spit on you then talk to if your big. My whole life I have heard the jokes heard the banter and seen people's eyes when I make eye contact. I don't have self esteem issues and I am comfortable and happy with the person I am I have been married and had plenty of girlfriends myself. The girlfriends usually ended up using me for money or left for someone else. My wife was a real woman but passed away shortly after we got married. So I know there are good woman out there. There just isn't a real site where us big guys can meet those woman and not the one I just went on a date with. If you believe that big guys don't get laughed at behind there back or people don't wistper to each other and giggle while they look at us. Please one day go with a big guy friend and really pay attention to what's going on around. Listen to the way SOME people talk to them that they don't others. I'm not making it up you will see."

There is something for everyone, but loving someone for what they are is how you can transcend the limitation of their special effect.

* I got thick eyebrows;
* My eyes are big, and my upper eye lids are exposed and when there is no light around the upper lid is even covering half of my eye;
* My nose is asymmetrical, one nose hole is bigger than the other
* There's to much space between my nose and mouth, it looks a bit monkey;
* From ""XS"" to ""XL"", I got ""M"" lips, which doesn't fit the rest of my fenotype at all;
* I got 4 moles on my face, of which one is so big everyone would look me weirdly when they see me the first time;
* My facial bone structural is ok, and I would guess above average. My upper-body is more masculine than most boys out there.

What can I do? Dating apps is no option, because everyone instantly swipes right when they see my ugly face.

I see no other choice.

Edit: girls always told my that I'm a ""nice"" boy, with ""great"" personality. So please don't come up with stuff like that.","As a fellow ugly guy, you just have to admit you're pretty much fucked. Your only hope is to try to live a normal life and hope for a shit ton of luck.

dating,ik4v0r,2020-08-31 19:34:21,Guys when you get rejected. Here‚Äôs why you shouldn‚Äôt feel defeated... (This is my attempt to lift your spirits up),"

Alright...

(Skip to the last 2 paragraphs if tl;dr)

You see a pretty girl or guy. Nice eyes. Nice height. He looks like he can give very good sex as well as give good time. Your expectations rise.

You approach them and then they have a good personality. You begin to like them so you ask their number to talk more. Things get very nervous because your expectations are high whether you want to or not.
Your expectations are high because you like this person and you can‚Äôt act like they aren‚Äôt because that will just make you feel more awkward or nervous.

The more you like this person the more the desire to be with this person. Sometimes it becomes so strong because you truly like this person that you try to avoid any ‚Äúhard truth‚Äù this is completely normal, i experience this too. 

This just shows you how much you value this person.

Most people who are cool about it or cold or super confident are usually people looking for sex. They‚Äôve put everyone in the same pedestal so there concept of ‚Äúspecial one‚Äù doesn‚Äôt exist because they‚Äôre out to feed their sexual desires or any other casual social desire.

Everyone experiences excitement and nervousness when we are really close to something we value. 
Think of it as an instinct that shows yourself that you **really** want it, and that once you‚Äôll get it you‚Äôll protect it and value it and take care of it. 

This can be dangerous though. Before you develop feelings for someone you need to analyse them and make an understanding of how they interact with their environment and friends, if they have any. 
I usually prevent myself from reaching this stage as I realise the people are like are generally immature and unwilling to learn.

Okay. So you now like this person and see them as good. Now you‚Äôre on your way to a romantic relationship with them.

Disaster strikes, they reject you.

dating,fk70g8,2020-03-17 15:20:04,How to Make a Woman Want You Sexually," Making a woman want you sexually is easier said than done. There are so many things that can go wrong while you are trying to make your girl sexually want you. There are chances that she might not look at you the same way you look at her, or she might not see more than a friend in you. And as long as a woman does not feel sexually attracted to you, she would not be able to be in a sexual relationship with you. Sexual attraction is one of the most significant factors that can make a woman want to have sex with you. This ultimate guide to attract women is sure to teach you some ways to make that girl go gaga over you. Without further ado, let us plunge into more interesting details.¬†

**Make her feel sexually attracted to you**¬†

If you want the girl of your dreams to be sexually attracted to you, you should avoid being too friendly and overbearing. If you fail to create a sense of sexual attraction, she might not fell the need to be loyal to you. She will most likely continue to sleep with other people whom she is sexually attracted to. So, bring out your charm and let that girl know your dirtiest sexual desires.¬†

**Portray a masculine vibe**¬†

Girls are not looking for boys; they are looking for men these days. One of the easiest ways to make a girl want you sexually is to make her feel feminine in comparison to your masculine vibe around her. If you can be calm, confident, and collected around her, she is most likely to fall for her in a jiffy. Learn how to approach a woman and entice her to the core.¬†

**Try coyly brushing your cheek, chin or nose against the side of her face while whispering something in her ear**

This is one of the easiest and the simplest ways to make a woman feel aroused. She is most likely to feel excited by the whisper and the physical contact of your face brushing against hers. She is sure to feel attracted to you if you are funny and can whisper something funny in her ear.¬†

**Don‚Äôt tell her that you have feelings for her unless she is very attracted to you**

This can scare any woman easily. Even when you are in love with her, you must wait for the right moment to be out with it. If she only feels mild levels of attraction for you, she won't be very thrilled about the fact that you like her. There are chances that she might thank you for the compliment and get on with her life. And there can nothing be worse than this.¬†

These tips are sure to help you make the girl of your dreams sexually attracted to you.¬†","Er, or accept she isn't picking up what you're putting down and pursue someone else?

I personally don't think these would work, though confidence is always good."

dating,c6ticq,2019-06-29 02:51:16,Dating younger girls is frowned upon!,"Why is it frowned upon when an older guy dates a younger girl? First off, I really don't care who judges me for dating girls who are younger than I am, but I do want people's opinion on this matter. So here is my deal... I have always dated younger girls than myself, anywhere from 1 year difference (I was 21 and she was 20) all the way to a 9 year difference (I was 28 and she was 19) and everything in between. I like dating younger because as a man I like the fact that I'm more experienced in life, I am a provider, I am their protector and they are fun. Now I'm 36 and and I'm ready to settle down and find ""the one"" who I'll spend the rest of my life with and have a family with. The problem is that recently I've been criticized by older women on my choice to date younger than me, mostly by my friend's 41 year old wife! She wants to hook me up with one of her ""approved"" friends which they all have kids and are either single mothers, or divorced. I'm not down with that, I've date divorced with kids before and I'm good on that, I learned my lesson. I'm looking more like a 26-30 year old who would want to (and is able to) have kids and start a family. I know what I want and that seems to be a problem for some people, mostly women. Why? I say live and let live. Also, I always seem to attract older women 38+ and BIGGER women, mostly divorced with kids. I'm sorry but that's not my cup of tea. It's like these women just expect me to settle for whatever they throw at me, no thank you. What are your thoughts on this? Thanks.",">The problem is that recently I've been criticized by older women on my choice to date younger than me, mostly by my friend's 41 year old wife!

Lol it's because they're upset that younger women are taking their aged men. But let's be honest; many 40+ year old women don't look as good as the younger women you're looking for. It's not that these older women couldn't look great (I think older women are sexy), it's just that they got lazy and now they look like it. 

>It's like these women just expect me to settle for whatever they throw at me, no thank you. What are your thoughts on this?

I've always hated that idea of settling for what other people want to give you. Fuck that. I'd rather put in a little bit of work and get exactly what I want. Go for the younger girls even if it takes you a little longer to find. It'll be worth it."

dating,10q8ib6,2023-01-31 19:47:36,Bf (34) says my weight gain has stopped him from having sex with me (f30),"EDIT: My cheating was in no way physical or sexual. I formed an emotional connection with an old friend. That‚Äôs it. We‚Äôve worked through it and he has assured me that it has no bearing on the current issue at hand and that my weight is 95% the problem.

My boyfriend and I have been together for about 15 years now. The last 6 years we haven‚Äôt had sex ONCE. As with all relationships, I expected a decline and not an abrupt stop. To give a little background - I have cheated on him once (not sexually though) about 8/9 years back and he was in a stressful work environment when the decline started. 

There would be weeks where I‚Äôd try and initiate and he would turn me down time after time. This eventually had an impact on my self esteem and I stopped initiating. I‚Äôve asked countless times if I was the problem and he would just say no and that he has a low libido.

Fast forward to a few months back, I found porn on his phone and started monitoring this. He was watching religiously every week sometimes multiple times a week. 

I‚Äôve confronted him about this and explained that even though the porn is not a problem, I do however have a problem that we‚Äôre in a long term relationship and basically celibate.

He confessed that ‚ÄúI have let myself go‚Äù and that it‚Äôs a turn off. I have picked up weight since we started dating (from about 90kgs to 115 at my heaviest). During this time I had to deal with a job loss, chronic illness and depression which contributed to the weight gain. He has changed in so many ways as well and I accept him as he is.

I feel like I‚Äôm willing to work on myself (currently eating healthier and working out and have lost about 6kgs so far) but I feel pressured to look a certain way and that I have to compete with pornstar standards. This has made me resent him and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd ever feel comfortable having sex with him again. 

Am I being dramatic or does he have a valid point?",">  The last 6 years we haven‚Äôt had sex ONCE.

So as I (17M) already found out that the Queen died an hour before, and was very distraught as I‚Äôve always loved the royal family and realized the historical significance she had but also i feel that this year is bound  to get worse. Keep in mind, that i already felt like shit and wanted to cry legitimately about the news; and as im having to push and slug myself to complete the days work in my economics class. I hear the friend of the girl i liked (18/19F) saying ‚Äúthe queen just died‚Äù and she yelped out a large ‚Äúmuahahahahree‚Äù like if she was golem from Lord of the Rings. She slammed her hands down on her desk as if she was Patrick from SpongeBob dramatically laughing and at that moment, my heart dropped and my interest in that girl died at that instance. I dont even want to look at her anymore so yes, i lost my interest in her but sadly in the worst way possible.

Tldr; I (17M) realized im glad i didnt move forward and try to go out with a girl i liked (18/19F) as soon as i heard her snarl and vehemently laugh and jester at the Queens death.

EDIT: yes, this is serious. Im only doing this to express how relieved i am, and we really need to start sharing red flags more and being able to recognize those.

dating,oy8n0i,2021-08-05 02:54:55,Women need to stop crapping on short guys,"I see it all the time when women comment that they've been with a short guy, you seem to generalize us off 1 short guy or a few. Its like as if one short guy thats an ass basically means short guys as a whole are assholes, at least thats  the vibe I get from women. I've seen a lot of comments, **especially from certain short women who love bad-mouthing short guys** that we're basically hot-headed assholes that try to cover up our insecurities and that we aren't basically allowed to feel what we feel. Our feelings are abnormal. We can't feel upset, sad, depressed, w/e at any point and if we do it seems like we are a bad candidate for women. At all times its like we have to put on a fake image for women to see. It might not even be about height and we might have other shit going on in our lives that we're just not in the right mood and for w/e reason some jackass seems to play that out that its our own fault for feeling like that.

Its like if we have someone in our lives that we lost or w/e we aren't allowed to feel that way and it somehow comes across as ""insecurity"" but god forbid we feel pissed off and upset at the treatment we get. We're just supposed to dance around in glee and pretend that we are happy as fuck, but in reality we aren't based on the shit we get from other people especially women. To the women that actually say good shit about us, god bless you, but the negativity is rampant based off certain short men that are assholes so I guess we all are.

The bullshit we get is irritating from other people. Just realize one thing, as short men we are allowed to feel what we want to feel. No one can tell us how to feel and our feelings are valid. Don't fucking play it out as us being our own enemies because in most cases its not, other people are. You don't live our lives, you aren't in our own shoes. The only ones that can understand us is short men themselves and women have no idea what its like to be a short man at all nor will they ever. Every feeling that a short man gets is completely acceptable for a tall guy. A short man thats an asshole gets ridiculed, a tall man thats an asshole gets women and its perfectly fine.

dating,nuz918,2021-06-08 07:42:36,Suddenly she hates giving me oral sex,"tl:dr - My ex girlfriend suddenly decided to stop give me oral sex, even when I return the favor.

It was a while ago when I dated this girl, we broke up a long time ago but every now and then I find myself thinking about our relationship, and wondering what could have lead her to this ""decision"", we had a serious relationship (at that point in time we already been dating for almost 2 years) and we loved each other very much, had great chemistry, until one day she told me she doesn't like to go down on me ""everytime we have sex""
From then it turned to no oral sex at all, when I asked her about it she used to say she never actually liked doing it which was a lie, because I KNOW she enjoyed doing it, she was SUPER passionate about it for most of our relationship.
I always kept myself clean, showered before having sex, and also well shaved, I always went down on her, even when the smell wasn't perfect, I still did and never ever thought about removing it from the ""list"", safe to say she expected oral sex but won't return the favor.
But again, she suddenly dropped this bomb which made me feel disgusting about myself, I considered this a deal breaker, we broke up a while ago.
I would not expect too much oral sex if it's just a fling, but in a serious relationship I would take that as if the girl is not attracted to me enough.

What do you guys think about this situation?
Any specific reason for it?
Any missing information, let me know, I'll answer in your comments, thanks!","It‚Äôs easy for it to lead to jaw pain, and often the way you act when you receive it makes a difference too.

dating,p64rwk,2021-08-17 14:22:16,"Men‚Äôs advice. If you want to be more than just a friend, then stop acting like her friend on dates. Don‚Äôt be ashamed of being sexual","Have you ever gone on a date with someone, and you seemingly had great chemistry, the conversation flowed, you both laughed, she even mentioned during or after the date that‚Äôs he had a great time. Then inexplicably, a few days later, she becomes less responsive, and finally you get the ‚ÄúI have to be honest‚Äù text. She says she thinks you‚Äôre a great guy, but she didn‚Äôt feel any chemistry and she hopes you can be friends.

Most guys are utterly confused by this, but if they were grounded in reality and observant, they would have seen it coming.

Having a good time and getting along doesn‚Äôt translate into romantic feelings. She saw you as a friend because you acted like one. You were too agreeable, you didn‚Äôt look at her with desire, you didn‚Äôt playfully tease her, you didn‚Äôt use subtle touch around her. You muted your sexual energy around her for the sake of being polite.

This is a common theme of the Nice Guy. They are ashamed of their masculine sexuality, and believe that acting in an asexual manner is what will win a woman‚Äôs respect, that is what society has conditioned him to believe.

What he fails to understand is that being sexual and being respectful aren‚Äôt mutually exclusive. Being lustful is where things become unbalanced, inappropriate comments are made, her personal space is invaded before you build comfort.

Even in the early stages of getting to know her, act more like her boyfriend than her friend. If you haven‚Äôt kissed, hooked up or had sex by the second or third date, unless she has a religious or spiritual reason to remain celibate, you are on a direct path to Friendville. Lack of touch or physical intimacy is the biggest indicator of lack of romantic interest or improper calibrated escalation.

A romantic relationship is friendship with the added element of sexuality and sexual attraction. Keep this in mind when you‚Äôre dating and feel a sense of shame for your desire.","I agree *to an extent*.

Flirting is very important and flirting implies something sexual. But ""imply"" is the key word there. Being explicit too early on is a major turn-off for most women. I don't really know how to explain in objective way, but you want her to be thinking ""this guy would fuck the shit out of me, but he's being a gentleman."""

dating,seabdt,2022-01-27 22:17:03,Should women date less attractive men?,"My friend sent me a study done a few years ago about how attractive women were happier dating less attractive men. They felt they were happier because what the men lacked in looks they made up for in kindness, gifts, trying to romance their partner etc. A guy I was talking to about this thinks that from the men‚Äôs perspective -that men and women think about sex differently. Not all the time, but a lot of the time. He said that men who never really had to try hard to get women‚Äôs attention took women‚Äôs attention for granted and if women gave them attention easily the guy was more inclined to look at women as sex objects or if a relationship didn‚Äôt work out have the mindset of ‚Äúwell I can always get a new one‚Äù. He said he didn‚Äôt feel that in general women really looked at men like this. I have no idea if there‚Äôs a difference there. He thought the key to finding a good man is to find one who is less attractive who will view you as ‚Äúhis prize‚Äù and work hard to not take you for granted. 

However some women think that dating down in terms of looks is doing a disservice to yourself. You will be dating someone who you aren‚Äôt attracted to or at least initially and have to work to develop an attraction to them. Sometimes men can get resentful (and we can see it here on Reddit a lot) when they are rejected by women over and over. They may develop a mindset of ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to get revenge‚Äù or develop FOMO if they suddenly become more attractive to women either by wealth, losing weight, etc, and leave the woman they have in the dust for someone more attractive to make up for lost time-if they are superficial (which is sometimes hard to tell if your dating someone who is superficial unless they say things that make it obvious). Also dating someone less attractive may lead to insecurity for the other person. 

I usually have dated less attractive men then me. I found their personalities seemed to be better. However one downside was that they seemed to be insecure whenever I received attention from other men and I had to assure them more. A couple became to the point of becoming controlling and abusive, but this could happen with any guy regardless of looks .Thoughts?","You already answered your own question, anybody can have a horrible personality and treat someone like crap so whatever your friend is saying sounds like he's trying to benefit himself for a relationship.

dating,x1f44c,2022-08-30 10:05:48,Wondering why men are so sexual early on? It's because men are adapting to feminism,"I see a lot of women get irritated that men just hit them up for sex. 

Why? Are you surprised?

Most men already know that you don't want to settle in your 20s.

Most men know that the idea of marriage repulses most women in their 20s.

Seriously....how many of you ladies actually want to take on a traditional relationship/marriage? Let's be honest, most of you ladies want to just ""explore"" the field and exercise your empowerment. Fair enough.

With all of that being said, men are adapting to the fact that women don't want to commit to us in their 20s. Why would we invest so much time and energy into getting to know you when we know that you are just gonna be clubbing every weekend, dancing all over random dudes? You ladies were the ones who asked to be treated like pieces of meat. So enjoy it.","I'm fairly sure that some fboy guy isn't thinking ""Oh noo, i can't date this lady cuz she isn't ready for a traditional marriage....seems like i must just f*ck and ditch.ü•≤"". Lmao. 

Both men and women who only/mostly seek seggs do so cuz that's simply what they want out of it.ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"

dating,12mcres,2023-04-14 20:44:49,Men are too logical for their own good,"As a man, I think that other men, especially men on reddit, have a tendency to be too ‚Äúlogical‚Äù for their own good. The amount of articles and statistics and graphs and data that get shared over and over again to try and justify or explain men being at a **supposed** disadvantage in dating is exhausting. At this point, we‚Äôve all heard these regurgitated talking points:

‚ÄúDating apps skew 75% (or higher) male.‚Äù

‚ÄúWomen only go for the top 1% of men.‚Äù

‚Äú33% of men haven‚Äôt had sex in the last year.‚Äù

‚ÄúMen take who they can get. Women have so many options and they all want the same top tier guy.‚Äù

The list goes on. I honestly believe that if more men stopped looking for data to back up their preconceived biases to explain why they‚Äôre not having the most dating success, they‚Äôd feel better about themselves rather than carrying around this constant mindset that the dating landscape is against them because they‚Äôre a man.

I get it. It‚Äôs disappointing to not succeed with a lot of the women you talk to. It‚Äôs disappointing to open up a dating app and see barely any new likes or matches. I‚Äôm not saying that none of the data is true, but constantly falling back on it as a go-to for why some men do better than others in dating is just annoying to see all the time in forums and threads.

It gets even worse when men give these stats to women as if to say ‚ÄúSee? Look at these numbers! You‚Äôre only having problems with dating because you‚Äôre making poor choices!‚Äù The horrible, blanket assumption that women‚Äôs dating woes could be solved simply by ‚Äúdating an average guy‚Äù is comical at this point.","I think it's not about logic, it's about emotions, it's easier to cope with your own personal dating failures if the numbers were always stacked against you."

dating,mlx3b9,2021-04-07 07:50:32,The main reason for peoples dating problems is not complicated but it is depressing,"So many people post on here about dating woes women and men and over complicate it. It literally all breaks down to the same shit 98% of the time. And it‚Äôs cruel and people don‚Äôt want to accept it. 

When women complain about a guy leaving them or not committing, it‚Äôs always (unless there were severe compatibility issues / psycho shit) based around the same reason. The guy found someone hotter. Or the guy just doesn‚Äôt find you that attractive and dated you for convenience and regular sex. I‚Äôve seen guys do this innumerable amounts of times. This is also usually the case because women tend to ‚Äúdate up‚Äù so the guys are usually out of their league (hence the lack of commitment) and can in fact find other women easily.  A top tier guy most of the time will only commit for the long haul with a really hot ass woman but he‚Äôll def fuck around with you and use you for sex if your only average or below average looking. Cold hard truth. 

When men complain about women leaving, it‚Äôs literally for the same reason, but you could add in maybe the other guy has more money/status. If women don‚Äôt want to date you, it‚Äôs because they get hotter guys than you on a regular basis so you don‚Äôt really exist to them at all. (Cough, Tinder.) Women don‚Äôt need to date less attractive men to get sex. They can get sex literally anytime and from men probably more attractive than you. 90% of men do not exist to women at all. If you don‚Äôt get a ton of matches on tinder, their algorithm has literally told you scientifically, you are in the bottom 90%. The top 10% of men DO get a shitload of matches, trust me I‚Äôve seen it, the disparity is monstrous (aka average guy gets 0-3 matches a month from let‚Äôs be honest, bots, transvestites, obese single mothers, hot guy gets 100s of matches a month from every single quality of woman, it‚Äôs not even remotely proportionate. Cold hard truth. 

The reality is the dating world is narcissistic and cruel. In a much more hyper and exaggerated way than it was say 25 years ago (before social media and online dating). The reality is your expectations don‚Äôt match what you‚Äôre able to garner. You‚Äôre reaching. People leave, don‚Äôt commit or don‚Äôt match with you because they have better options than you, or at least believe they do. Are there outlier examples to my reasoning? Yes, obviously, but this seems to ring true for the vast, I mean vast, majority of the time.","I‚Äôm above average at most with looks and I get a decent amount of matches.

She's super, ultra sweet, unfailingly kind, quite smart, funny, is interested in a lot of weird/cool shit that she has introduced me to. I really like her as person.

Only issue is that I'm not visually attracted to her. Met her on Hinge, she liked one of my prompts (only like/match I've ever gotten), spoke for a bit, went onto IG, met for coffee. We've been to a lot of different places since then, done a lot of different things. Really cool person. At first, I wasn't even comfortable with her touching me, but now, I have become so. But the thought of kissing her or anything more, makes me feel uneasy. 

We were talking on IG, she kinda asked me why I haven't made a move with a ""haha"". I told her that I like taking it slow because I didn't know what else to say. But it was fairly clear that she didn't really digest that bit very well, so I'm pretty sure she's about to check out unless I make a move asap.

I know this is horrible, super shallow, and immature, to care about looks, but I want to work on that and get past it. I know it sounds like I'm asking for a deadline extension or something like that, but I think I can get myself attracted to her if I get another month or two.

dating,sq741g,2022-02-11 19:13:33,This is how you become a naturally confident & attractive man,"Hey guys.

Just wanted to share an idea with you that might help you with your inner game.

So there's a pretty common notion in entrepreneurship that says:

***""The shittier the product, the bigger the advertising budget""***

If the product is shit, people won't write great reviews and refer their friends. They won't stick around or come back. And without sinking tons of money into advertising on a regular basis, that product will sink.

But how does this apply to dating?

Well if I re-wrote the above quote for dating/seduction it would be...

***""The more unhappy, anxious, needy or insecure you are, the more you need techniques/systems to convince her otherwise""***

I know this is pretty common knowledge in this community. But it still baffles me when I come across ""accomplished"" pick-up artists who got there by developing cringey systems of seduction, only to still be utterly miserable (For example, Todd V and Mystery both look tired and depressed these days IMO).

To me, techniques, tactics & systems reek of unresolved trauma, repressed emotions, insecurity, fear and a desperate need to win her affection and *control* the outcome.

I want you to be an emotionally healthy, genuinely confident, sexually **wanted** man WITHOUT feeling like you need to memorise a boatload of confusing bullshit.

**So what do I recommend as an alternative?**

Well, in a nutshell, it boils down to walking the long road of becoming a naturally attractive man who women choose. This is the road that most men avoid but when you walk it, you change forever.

**This man:**

* Doesn't need to prowl the streets like some sex-starved adolescent, because women are throwing him signals all over the place as he goes about his day.
* He accepts himself just as he is.
* He embraces his sexuality, his insecurities and his shortcomings.
* He also KNOWS what he brings to the table, and doesn't need anyone to tell him.
* He loves his life and he loves himself.

You don't get there by memorising systems, openers, negs or the perfect escalation ladders. That shit just reconfirms the false belief that you're worth fuck all without them.

***You get there by doing the real work on your trauma.***

You address the root of your emotional neediness and the bullshit beliefs about your own worthiness and desirability. You slowly let go of that 60kg pack of shame you drag into every one of your approaches.

Do you have to stop approaching while you do this? Of course not. In fact, action is essential.

I'm just saying that if you're obsessing over the perfect system of seduction or the ideal ""method"" to get ANY woman into bed with you in 5 seconds or less - you're probably being sold to by a coach who needs you to believe that all you lack is his system.

You're majoring in the minor.

The reality is, you are okay just as you are.

You just don't believe it. You read those words and you can't comprehend it through your shame tinted goggles. Your experiences and conditioning have told you that you're just not enough and you're looking for a woman who will tell you otherwise.

Despite being enough just as you are, you have work to do.

**So here's what you can do now to start becoming that shameless, confident natural...**

1. Write your life story from start to present.
2. Join a men's group and start unpacking the shit you're carrying.
3. Cut out distractions and practice sitting alone in silence for 30 minutes a day.
4. Write 3 pages of incoherent brain dump in a journal every morning.
5. Stare into a mirror for 5 minutes every so often and let yourself feel whatever comes up.

This isn't an exhaustive list at all. I still pretty much guarantee though that if you started implementing the above, you would notice a deep shift in your confidence within a couple of months.

Anyway, that's all I've got right now. Thanks for reading.

And good luck on your journey, men.

dating,so2cw6,2022-02-09 02:39:19,Don‚Äôt shoot your shot.,"From perhaps the beginning of modern dating, what are men told whenever they have taken interest in a woman?

‚ÄúGo up to her.‚Äù    ‚ÄúMake a move.‚Äù     ‚ÄúShoot your shot.‚Äù    ‚ÄúAsk her out.‚Äù    ‚ÄúThe worst she can say is no.‚Äù  

Men are told this from both other men and women. And yet, it‚Äôs terrible advice. Why? Because men seem to have gotten the idea into their head that even if there‚Äôs no indication that a woman is interested in them, and that she‚Äôll probably reject him, he should still make his own interest clear, as a matter of practice. And that just leads to negative consequences for both sides.

Rejecting a man isn‚Äòt a whole lot of fun for a woman. Because many women feel absolutely no attraction to the man asking them out, they certainly don‚Äôt want to agree to any date. Yet they feel like it‚Äôs rude/mean to do so, which puts them in a sticky spot. It‚Äôs also pretty annoying to have to coddle the ego of some man. When the man who is formally making overt moves on her isn‚Äòt someone she knows well, she‚Äòll probably feel some lack of safety out of fear of how this man will react when she says no. And when the man *is* someone she knows well, she‚Äòll probably feel annoyed at how someone who she thought was just a normal person in her life was just another man who sees her as a love interest instead of how she saw them.

Of course, being rejected as a man isn‚Äôt a walk in the park, either. Being rejected is of course a disappointment on the person being rejected. Being rejected can be a pretty big blow to someone‚Äôs self-esteem- not when it happens just once, but when failure happens relentlessly after every attempt, it takes a toll on someone. And it makes him feel foolish as well. Not only did the other person find you unattractive- but you were actually foolish enough to believe they didn‚Äôt! Additionally, being rejected over and over again isn‚Äôt a good look. It makes someone appear to be desperate, unable to find someone who‚Äòs interested, and not very self-aware. It does no good to be rejected, except in a ‚Äúwhat doesn‚Äôt kill you makes you stronger‚Äú sense.

A lot of the time a man asks a woman out, they aren‚Äôt strangers- they‚Äôre good friends or acquaintances who were building a relationship with each other. And when the man tells the woman she‚Äôs interested, but she doesn‚Äôt feel the same way, it can put a huge damper on the company that they probably enjoyed between each other. Sometimes, it can be repaired. But other times, it totally ends what could‚Äôve otherwise been a great, mutually beneficial relationship had the man kept his feelings to himself.

So no, men, don‚Äôt shoot your shot just because you‚Äôre interested and she‚Äôs single. I know this advice goes against everything you‚Äôve probably been told, but trust me- for the sake of both you and her, unless she‚Äôs made some some clear signs she‚Äôs interested, keep your feelings to yourself.

TL;DR Men shouldn‚Äôt ask out women whenever they are interested because rejections helps absolutely no one and should be avoided. Men should only approach if their are clear signs that the women is interested.","Good sentiment, not realistic. This advice sounds like a theory and method of keeping less than desirable men from entering the dating pool. It instructs them to learn their place and stay invisible."

When I asked him he said that he doesn't cook and often goes to his mums for dinner.",No of course not. People who can cook tend to have their lives together more. It‚Äôs a harmless question.
dating,qg9e2i,2021-10-26 15:50:53,Guys that are bad at sex,"So I have two issues with dating involving sex. For one, I find that a lot of men I‚Äôve gone on dates with try to have sex with me right away which is a red flag if I have said I want to take things slow and I‚Äôm looking for a relationship. I know some people have different opinions on this, but I am looking for a guy who isn‚Äôt into casual hook ups and this is just how I weed those guys out. I believe that having sex too soon can ruin things for people too, and allows them to focus on sex instead of whether or not the two people are a good match. There are people who will let sex cloud their judgement about a person, and it just muddies things up for some people. 

However, waiting too long to have sex can present another issue. What if I wait awhile to get to know the guy, I‚Äôm satisfied that he‚Äôs not just after sex, and then I hate having sex with him.  I feel that around 90 percent of men I‚Äôve had sex with I did not enjoy having sex with them. I talk to other women, and they often have the same experiences. Some women aren‚Äôt that sexual and could care less about how big a guys penis is or how long he lasts in bed, but for women who do care I hear it‚Äôs a problem. For me the problem is that I find that most guys I have had sex with last under 5 minutes in bed. Sometimes it‚Äôs been up to ten minutes but never more than that except for 2 men out of all the the guys I‚Äôve been with. It‚Äôs disappointing because then after I have to say well, I guess it‚Äôs on to the next one. 

From doing some reading I read stats that say for most women it takes 20 minutes for them to have an orgasm while it takes men anywhere from 2-10 minutes. I usually give guys a few chances like up to 6 chances probably before I decide that they are just not going to last very long in bed ever . I feel bad talking to them about it because I don‚Äôt want to make them feel horrible if it‚Äôs out of their control. But I also feel bad ghosting a guy after sex. When in the past I talked to a couple guys about it and asked if they could read about fixing it like whether it be jerking off more, etc. nothing worked. Usually the men I‚Äôve slept with who don‚Äôt last very long sometimes also have issues with maintaining an erection. I read that the two can go hand in hand and that this is becoming a big issue with men. Health issues like stress, being over weight, and blood pressure issues can contribute to this so it can be a very common problem. To make matters worse lots of men don‚Äôt even see a problem in these issues and don‚Äôt even try to satisfy women in bed. 

I have talked to other women to find out how I can vet men for these issues before I sleep with them and the consensus has been that I can‚Äôt . I thought maybe giving a handjob first could work, but then I realized that a handjob is very different than sex and from talking to guys men can last a lot longer from them. And talking about it first doesn‚Äôt help either because lots of men will just lie about their Dick size and bedroom skills. So I guess I just have to have sex with them to find out. I guess if women want guys that don‚Äôt have small penises and also have stamina, we should be dating black guys. Which also hasn‚Äôt worked out great for me. So even a thing like my sexual preferences, which are only a small part compared to other things I value in a man, makes me feel like I will never meet a man who matches my standards. If I can‚Äôt even meet a man who can sexually satisfy me, other parts of having a relationship are less appealing. I can take care of myself, I have a vibrator, I have friends to keep me entertained‚Ä¶.so why should I want to date? This is something I ask myself whenever I try dating. I guess I am just venting about it but if anyone has any advice on how to deal with these issues let me know.","Sex is not solely the man's responsibility, what are you doing to ensure you have good sex? Have you ever stopped to consider whether you are bad at sex? 

Also dick size does not translate to good sex. And you are straight up racist if you're going after black guys because you think they have big dicks."
dating,pnzro4,2021-09-14 10:00:31,Me [19M] Am being purged by a group of girls,"
This situation started about 2 weeks ago and has escalated drastically since then. So I am a guy who only looks for sex from women and no type of relationship, and before I do anything with girls I let them know I‚Äôm just trying sleep with you and I I‚Äôm not interested in a relationship. And for the most part things go okay except for  one particular girl didn‚Äôt seem to get it. After about about a week and a half of talking to this F[19] from my school we hit it off pretty quick and we winded up sleeping with each other even though she knows what kind of guy I am and what I want. The next day she starts texting me and i don‚Äôt respond which I do to almost all the girls after I sleep with them. But after 23 texts o had to respond and tell her to stop and that she needs to leave me alone, and that‚Äôs when it started. In a 2 week time span she went back to all the girls I had slept with and told them crazy things like I forced her to do things she didn‚Äôt want and that I‚Äôm some kind of lunatic who cares nothing about women and so on. So all the girls I had slept with in the past agreed with her and started saying I did similar things to them like force them to sleep with me off rip and other things.  They are really trying to ruin me and it‚Äôs getting worse what do I do","Sleep with many girls and then ignore all of their texts, what did you think was gonna happen to your reputation?"
dating,o1nvwj,2021-06-17 03:58:18,Why do so many people paint women like they are all extremely shallow creatures that only care about dating guys that are above their station?,"
I see where these people are coming from. I have gotten rejected a gazillion times and have myself spiral down in the depression and anger pitt which leads on hating on women to release some steam off. 

However, I have met really cool girls that are nothing like what many people here complain about ‚Äúthe nature of women‚Äù. Which is super stupid since no 2 humans are the same. 

What I am thinking is that the cool girls are not as loud as the not-so-cool ones and therefore are not as noticeable if one does not take the time to get to know them. Therefore, these not-so-cool girls tend to be all these people see. 

Also, based on my experience the nice girls that I have met are super busy with their careers to be partying in clubs and they hate online dating. 

I feel that many people here had the bad luck of getting a really shitty sample, and that is why they hold their negative  views.

I repeat, no 2 humans are the same. Every member of my family is so different from one another. All of my friends are different as well. We all have different views including the kind of girls that we find attractive and what we want in a girl. 

I have met guys that disgust me with their cheating and machismo, and I have met feminazis that I hate because they make me feel terrible for the sole crime of have been born a guy.

If I just generalized entire genders based on my bad experiences then I wouldn't talk to anyone at all because people from both genders have hurt me and disappointed me more times than I can remember.

The human brain loves shortcuts to save energy. Generalizations are an easy, but highly flawed way of humans to make sense of the world and others. Just please be aware of this, have an open mind and know that everyone is different.

And the statements ‚ÄúWomen are x and like x‚Äù and ‚ÄúMen are y and like y‚Äù are always flawed due to our differences. 

As a wise guy once said: ‚ÄúAll generalizations are false, including this one.‚Äù - Mark Twain","The majority of Reddit users are young men. They are often entitled.  They are often not putting forth energy to better themselves.  Some are incels. Some are simply frustrated.  They don't want to look inward and make positive changes, so they project onto women.  They refuse to accept certain realities when it comes to the way most societies function regarding men making more money, women losing employment due to pregnancy, staying home to raise their children due to the cost of child care, the cost of divorce and then having to return to work, or many other factors.  Not to mention that the stereotypes seem to be perpetuated regarding the men finding worth being the provider and the woman being the trophy."

Everything is stacked against me on tinder. I can‚Äôt fix my photos to beat the 6 and 7 guys. I can‚Äôt fix my facial aesthetic and go up 2 or 3 whole points. That just doesn‚Äôt happen.

dating,jwyt7e,2020-11-19 08:04:42,Just remembered my worst date and decided to share,"Basically, we went to see a movie - Spider-Man far from home. It was not going great as she kind of arrived late for the movie and a lot of other stupid uncalled for things. But what takes the prize was when the movie ended and I was trying to make small talk. So here is this girl telling me she really likes Marvel movies. Especially Spider-Man. So I ask her, ""Oh, that is so cool! Me too! How did you find this movie? Good? Bad? Decent? Also, which Spider-Man movie franchise do you prefer?"" and she hits me back with ""There are more movies!?""

So yeah, I guess she was trying to fake it till she makes it. But you know what is worse than telling me you do not like what I like? Faking it and getting caught!

Anyway, I hope this could be a funny story for someone to read today. Don't sweat it! Bad dates just happen. Also, before someone starts telling me how that should not matter, don't worry, this was not the nail in the coffin.","That‚Äôs your worst date?!?!? Bloody hell. Come back when you have something actually happen.

FYI her statement that she likes marvel movies and especially the Spider-Man one you had just seen was likely TRUE. You don‚Äôt need to be an uberfan who‚Äôs watched every movie to admit you like it.

I hate this idea you have to be a fan to like something. I like classical music. I‚Äôm not afraid to admit that. But if you start asking me details of composers and stuff I‚Äôll be honest that I don‚Äôt know that much.... and there‚Äôs nothing wrong with that.

You probably missed a great opportunity to open her eyes to more marvel movies. 

Instead you were a gatekeeping asshole."
dating,ee14el,2019-12-22 05:34:04,6 Reasons Why Dating an Introvert Is Better,"**What is it like dating an introvert?**  
Well, back when I first started looking for love, I noticed that one of my extroverted friends had a very different style than I did when it came to dating. He enjoyed staying out late at bars and clubs, and he was not shy at all about broaching sexual topics with women he had just met.

That‚Äôs not me at all. As an introverted man, I‚Äôm reserved and gentle. I believe that it‚Äôs more respectful to wait at least a little while before becoming physically intimate with someone. However, after watching my friend have several successful romantic encounters, I started to worry that I had to be more like him if I wanted to find love. Was his extroverted personality more suitable for dating? Was my introverted personality a curse on my love life?  
Turns out, being an introvert is not a curse at all. Introverts have a lot of unique advantages when it comes to love. Here are six reasons it can be better to date an introvert.

**Advantages of Dating an Introvert**

**1. Introverts cultivate deep, meaningful relationships.**  
Introverts prefer to connect deeply with a chosen few people rather than maintain surface-level relationships with many acquaintances. We tend to be polite and sincere, and this helps us make meaningful connections. The extrovert I mentioned earlier has an address book filled with women‚Äôs phone numbers. He‚Äôs had a lot of hookups and short-term flings. On the other hand, I take my time when getting to know someone romantically. Even though he‚Äôs gone out with more women than me, ultimately, my relationships last longer.

**2. We tend to listen well and be perceptive of others.**  
Our powerful ability to listen helps our significant other feel heard. We notice small things, such as what our partner likes, how they‚Äôre feeling, and which kinds of gestures mean the most to them. We understand what makes them tick, and we‚Äôre naturally good at stepping into their shoes and seeing things from their point of view. Because of this, it‚Äôs easy for us to make our partner feel loved in the ways that mean the most to them.

**3. We build strong emotional connections.**  
We tend to stay away from shallow small talk and impersonal banter about the weather. Instead, many introverts enjoy discussing more meaningful topics such as what gets us out of bed in the morning, our thoughts on the latest Game of Thrones episode, or whether Team Iron Man or Team Captain America should have won. We share our hopes and dreams, and we‚Äôre good at getting our significant other to do the same. We‚Äôre naturally good at making the conversation more personal and creating emotional intimacy.

**4. We tend to be calm during conflict.**  
Introverts generally know how to keep their cool, which can be an incredible gift in the midst of conflict. In Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can‚Äôt Stop Talking, Susan Cain recalls her experience as a Wall Street lawyer representing a client who had trouble repaying a loan and was hoping to negotiate new terms against nine angry bankers and their lawyer. Describing herself in the third person, Cain writes, ‚ÄúShe rarely spoke without thinking. Being mild-mannered, she could take strong, even aggressive, positions while coming across as perfectly reasonable.‚Äù Instead of trying to be louder or more dominant than her opposition, she remained calm in the meeting, which helped reduce the tension in the room and ultimately won her the day.

**5. We‚Äôre often deliberate and reflective**.  
Because many of us were teased or bullied about our quiet ways growing up, we know just how hurtful words can be. We understand that they can leave deep, invisible cuts that may never heal completely. And, the wrong thing said in the heat of the moment can never be taken back. Introverts tend to be less impulsive in this regard.  
As Cain explains in Quiet, Professor Kagan of the Laboratory for Child Development at Harvard observed that a group of five hundred infants could be divided into two groups, ‚Äúhigh-reactive‚Äù and ‚Äúlow-reactive,‚Äù based on their reaction to stimuli such as recorded voices or balloons popping. The high-reactive children ‚Äî that is, the ones who reacted more when surrounded by other people and loud noises ‚Äî would turn out to be introverts. Kagan observed that these children tended to spend more time considering all the alternatives when presented with a choice and therefore made less impulsive decisions.

**6. Introverts understand and accept people for who they are.**  
Introverts live in an extroverted world, so we know what it‚Äôs like to have to play a role. Often, we have to put on a mask and act more extroverted than we really are in order to fit in. We understand what it‚Äôs like to be misunderstood, so in turn, we often offer understanding and acceptance to the people in our lives.

For us, a Friday night spent watching Netflix in our pajamas is an awesome night. Small talk is a form of torture. A rainy afternoon spent indoors is just as beautiful as a sunny day spent outdoors. And our favorite thing about partying is able to go home afterwards!

When we find someone who understands and appreciates us for who we are, we cherish those people, whether they are a peace-loving introvert or rowdy extrovert.","I'm an introvert, but this post just oozes sour grapes and elitism. The qualities you've listed are not exclusive to introverts, one can be an extrovert and still be able to understand and cultivate relationships at a deeper, meaningful level. You make it sound like all extroverts are loud, vacuous fuckboys/girls just because your friend happens to be like that. This lack of empathy towards people different from you is ironic considering your last point."
dating,cugzz0,2019-08-23 17:26:06,"Is it just me, or does there seem to be a clear relationship between the age and attractiveness of the women and the chance she contacts me again?","I'm bombarded with stuff like ""its all subjective"", ""depends on the person"", ""looks is not why you get rejected"", etc.

&#x200B;

but I can't help but notice that ALL EVIDENCE points otherwise.

I've been on probably 75-100 dates. There is one CLEAR pattern I have noticed, and I feel like I am taking crazy pills because people seem to fight on these this one thing.

&#x200B;

\-The younger  the girl, the higher propability that she will not want to see you (not match, not continue talking, flake, not want to see you on the next date). This part is pretty obvious, but the most striking thing is that her behavior is INDEPENDENT of how good the date/interaction went. good dates still lead to ghosting.

\-the more attractive the women, the higher the probability that she will not want to see you as well. again, the most striking this is that her wanting to see you is completely indepedent on how the date/interaction went.

&#x200B;

**this EASILY explains a lot of inconsistent behaviors I've seen. namely:**

&#x200B;

Going on a ton of great dates with younger/attractive women, that end with a kiss/makout/sex, only to see her ""change her mind later"".

Going on a ton of poor dates with women that were not so attractive/older, little chemistry/etc, or I was just plain nervous/etc. and having them want to see you again and text all the time.

&#x200B;

these are CLEAR patterns I've noticed. the usually rebuttel I get is ""well maybe you were more nervous and acted differently because you were intimidated by the attractive women"". that's a great theory, but  doesnt account for the poor dates I've had with women who were older/less attractive that ended up wanting to see me again.

&#x200B;

It just boggles my mind that people don't notice this, or are so quick to throw out the ""looks don't really matter, it was your personality that was the issue"".

and for the record, I'm not trying to offend any women here with comparing older/younger attractive/less attractive. Its just Ive noticed that these are the biggest factors, and I need to point them out for my story to make sense.","Oh wow, so you're saying hot chicks are harder to get than less attractive ones??  I think you're on to something here..."
dating,7gxj6s,2017-12-01 19:49:37,Isn't the end goal of dating....sex.,"When you start dating someone new, there‚Äôs always the question of when you should have sex for the first time. Society says after three dates, your grandmother says after marriage, your penis says right now‚Ä¶but when‚Äôs the actual right time? Nobody on this sub seems to care , or seems to be headed in that direction. ","There is no standard right time. Have sex when you are both ready.


Sidenote: I always thought the end goal of dating was marriage since a lot of people have sex before they date."
dating,wp2hpg,2022-08-15 15:28:34,"I (34F) did what most of the guys on this sub suggest and lowered my standards in the looks department to try to find a guy who is nicer, here is how that is working out...","\- I have zero sexual attraction to him whatsoever.

\-A sense of humor is really important to me and he has none. His dad jokes are so lame I spend most of our dates and texting conversations fake laughing at his really bad jokes.

\-We have very little in common and his hobbies and things are not something I would be interested in doing at all (Magic Cards, pokemon go).

\-I have spent money and precious little free time I have on dates with this person that I have zero chemistry with just because he is nice.

Attraction to me has so much more to do with personality and sense of humor than it does with looks and neither looks nor personality is there for me even though he is nice. This is why I am always baffled when the overwhelming suggestion to women on all the dating subs to ""compromise"" by finding a nice guy that may not be the most attractive to us. It turns out, if I were to pursue a long term relationship with the nice guy that I am not attracted to, we would likely have a really lame sex life and we would have nothing to talk about or do together because we don't have the same hobbies. So I did what y'all suggested and it's not working out very well. So to have a nice guy we have to settle for someone we are not attracted to and have nothing in common with?? 

TLDR: See lots of advice on the dating subs if you want a nice guy you have to lower your appearance standards. Wondering about the logic of having a good relationship with a person who is nice but that you're not attracted to at all.","Your entire post has little to do with looks. 

You selected someone that is ugly to you in both physical and personality characteristics. 

In fact you complain way more about personality."
dating,po0pwu,2021-09-14 11:15:04,Where to find a guy who doesn‚Äôt watch porn?,Genuinely curious if anyone knows. If it‚Äôs even possible.,"As a male the more active I became with dating and having regular sex, the less I watched porn until eventually it became both an impractical use of my energy and no longer arousing.

So from my personal experience, find a guy you really like and bang his brains out until he no longer needs that shallow fantasy to fill that void.

And no it's not your responsibility to ""help"" a man not use porn, but it *is* something a great many guys do if there isn't a regular option for their sexual release. 

So if *you* want him to stop using porn you'll have far better luck making yourself the fixation of his sexual desire instead of shaming him for looking at it."
dating,s3aqjo,2022-01-13 21:53:36,A lot of you men on here just have no game or confidence.,"I hate to say this so bluntly, but too often do i see men, especially men near my age (M21), say that they will forever be alone, or they try everything and still get rejected. The answer is simple, yall are just bad at talking to women. Whether it be you want a relationship, or just sex, you still have to ‚Äúpull‚Äù the woman. Like i said im M21, 6 ft, and id give myself maybe a 6? Just an average looking guy, and i used to have trouble with women in early highschool, but ever since then ive never had trouble with them. So im going to help you. First and foremost, make them laugh. That should be your #1 goal when talking to a woman. A funny man comes off as easy going, and likeable. First impressions are everything, and if you can make them laugh within the first couple minutes of meeting them, youre off to a good start. Second, stop being so scared, women are people too. The same way you would approach another dude, is the way you would approach a woman. Ik some people have anxiety, but unfortunately, it‚Äôs very easy to tell when someone is unconfident in themselves, so practice. Third, please do not be a creep when flirting. If you dont know how to flirt, complimenting them is a good way to start. And not ‚Äúdamn girl your ass looks fat‚Äù, mention their nails, hair, hell even their eyes. And lastly, and this is mostly for dating apps like tinder. For Women around my age, ‚Äúhey‚Äù is not going to cut it. You are one of many, go learn some pickup lines, clever ones, funny ones, sweet ones. But like i said first impressions are everything. Side note: you are going to get rejected, it happens, but dont turn into an asshole because of it. Being disrespectful towards women is a sure fire way to make sure you dont get any. Now use these tips and go get you some. 

Tldr:if you struggle with women its because your approach is wrong. Make them laugh, be confident, learn some pickup lines, and for gods sake dont be a creep, or an asshole if you get rejected.","I just want to emphasize that TALKING IS A SKILL. Some are natural at it, some are not. For those that are not, you‚Äôll struggle in the beginning. If you practice (like any other skill), you will get better over time. Once you‚Äôre comfortable talking to others, it‚Äôll be even easier to talk to women when you want to flirt. I consider myself a shy introvert so I even had to work on it, but it is possible"
dating,yghofm,2022-10-29 11:52:58,Ladies. What are you looking for?,"Be honest. It's a very confusing time for dating, and it seems many girls don't really want a serious relationship anymore, but just a man (or various men) that will make them ""feel"" something. While most guys are still traditional at heart and at the end we wanna find our princess to build a home and future with. 

So chicas, what do you want in a man? 
Or do you even really want to find that 1 man? And in that man, what are you really looking for? Fun, feelings, or a real future? ......","I‚Äôve been in a relationship for 3 years and I‚Äôm really young, 22. I feel like my bf is perfect I‚Äôd say I do ASAP if he asked lol. My favorite qualities are his emotional intelligence as I don‚Äôt personally know any men that are the slightest bit emotionally intelligent. He‚Äôs kind and empathetic and sweet. It makes a girl feel safe and loved. If this sounds like you or you want it to be you maybe do some research on emotional intelligence or put it in your tinder bio. Maybe some girls who are looking for that will come to you"
dating,rg9nyu,2021-12-14 15:16:35,Men‚Äôs advice. Men who are unsuccessful with women share one characteristic: they make excuses,"Men who struggle with women almost always have a mindset of self-victimization. They believe that their unattractive qualities are static, and that women are a monolithic group that have somehow deemed them unworthy. 

When I was unsuccessful, I had the same mindset as well. It wasn‚Äôt until I took ownership of my situation, and realized that there were things about myself that I needed to change, that things began improving. It‚Äôs uncomfortable, but it‚Äôs also freeing. You realize you have control over most aspects of your life. 

- ‚ÄúI‚Äôm ugly.‚Äù There is a difference between being physically attractive and naturally good looking. Being physically attractive involves being in shape, wearing clothes that fit, having good posture and body language, being well groomed. Being physically attractive, which you have control over, is more important than being naturally good looking.

- ‚ÄúI‚Äôm short.‚Äù There are some women who put emphasis on height, and there‚Äôs nothing you can do about that. Move on. You see short guys with beautiful women all the time. The height requirement is usually a fabrication of the online dating world. A gregarious personality and confidence is far more powerful than height. 

- ‚ÄúI‚Äôm shy.‚Äù This isn‚Äôt a static quality. Being introverted and shy aren‚Äôt one in the same. It‚Äôs extremely uncomfortable, but you have to ask yourself if you really want to change. Being shy is the single biggest inhibitor to social success. If you can‚Äôt function socially, you should pursue therapy, or even medication if a mental health professional feels it‚Äôs necessary.

- ‚ÄúI‚Äôm boring.‚Äù This is on you. You likely aren‚Äôt boring, you are just afraid to be vulnerable and show people who you are. This is normal; it‚Äôs difficult to share ourselves with others, and face rejection.  If you don‚Äôt feel like you have a dynamic personality, or have much to talk about, you need to expand your horizons. Find a hobby you‚Äôre passionate about, read more, go out and try things you‚Äôve been hesitant to pursue.

Bottom line is, you have to put yourself out there. You have to experience getting rejected, and having success as well. Until you‚Äôre willing to experience these type of emotions, things won‚Äôt change. No more excuses.

Edit: This post isn‚Äôt meant to be callous towards men who are struggling, or excuse bad behavior from certain women. It‚Äôs meant to point of that most things in life aren‚Äôt static, and that you have control.",Aha. I see nobody has posted generic tips of the week #513. You beat the rest of us to it.
dating,yc08zs,2022-10-24 02:52:07,"Been talking to this online girl for years, should I move on?"," I M(23) have been talking this online girl F(22) since I was in middle school.

She keeps dropping hints or making jokes that she wants commitment. She hasn‚Äôt flat out asked me yet. She has a great personality and is attractive. However as she is not a native, I know very little about her past. 

I have got the vibe off her that she may be quite promiscuous and personally that‚Äôs not a quality I would desire in someone I would take seriously. 

She has been using Instagram stories as a manipulation tool, posting different guys. I was flat out ignoring it for a bit but taking note. However, some guy literally flew in from abroad to stay with her the past few days and they are obviously fucking. 

Fair enough, we‚Äôre not in a relationship and she can do whatever she wants but the fact that she blatantly posts him at her house at 3am in order to get at me pissed me off. 

I won‚Äôt lie, it did sting seeing that. I have left her on read since Friday after she mentioned him again.

I don‚Äôt know if that is the right approach but should I just cut contact now before it gets any worse? Or should I hit her back up in a few days and just stop seeing her as frequently?

dating,13nz9c2,2023-05-21 16:23:26,I screwed it up last night,"I M32, really love my roomie F29, bisexual, she's beautiful in so many ways that I'm just in love with her, we are like a couple that does everything together without sex and cuddling. I've told her I like her, we've kissed several times but she's recently broken up a 10 years relationship with her girlfriend and is not ready for a new one.

 Last night, we went dancing and almost literally everyone around us wanted to make up with her, plus, she brought a 'friend' who has the same intentions. For me, it was a NIGHTMARE to be there. I'm not particularly jealous of girls approaching her because I know she is more attracted to women than men and me, as a man, love to see 2 girls kissing. There was a moment where this girl is kissing her and the man who is with that girl is trying to join them, at that moment I couldn't help pushing my roomie's arm and interrupt the threesome kiss, just like your partner would in the same situation. She was obviously surprised and told me ""what are you doing? I'm lesbian"" which for me, it meant, ""don't try to keep me from kissing girls because I prefer them over a man and you're not my boyfriend either"" or that's how I felt it. I explained her that I lost my mind when I saw the man trying to kiss them, she agreed, she didn't want to kiss him either and was thankful I didn't let that happen. 

She is totally fine. I am devastated. I feel like I still can't control the high anxiety jealousy gives me, and last night I showed the person I'm loving the most the major red flag I have.  Jealousy was a huge problem in my 20's.

I had this dream today after the incident where her friends came over and I went insane and made our home a disaster, throwing things like a maniac, screaming at and insulting everyone who was trying to touch her. I feel really bad.

I haven't been in a relationship for 3 years now, I've never really found love, I'm a thin 5'6 man so 90% of women would not be interested in me. I don't want to be alone anymore, I'm a failure, everybody says good things about me but no one would really go on a date with me. I work at home and I'm an immigrant so I barely have a couple of friends. The routine, lack of love, and life purpose not very often make me romanticize death as a peaceful place to stay. 

I want to have someone to love me, care for me, to grow economically and personally together, travel, explore, I'm tired of being alone and feeling lonely. My roomie is a perfect match but at this point, I don't know what's gonna happen. I really love her and want her with me üò≠ I promise I will take care of her and treat her like she deserves.

dating,12udu58,2023-04-21 18:37:29,Why does it seem like the majority of men fear committing to women?,"I've read so many posts here and on other subs where a woman thinks a relationship is great but the guy doesn't want to be serious or exclusive but is perfectly fine to have sex with her. Yet at the same time I've seen countless posts here about men being lonely and unloved and can't get laid etc.

It makes no sense how they can claim they want all these things they'd get from a relationship yet don't don't want a relationship. Meanwhile most women in relationships know they do a disproportionate amount of mental labor and general effort. So like, men don't have to do hardly anything while in a relationship with a woman who will likely take care of everything for them, and yet they're still adverse to commitment? Why? It costs them next to nothing and gives them basically everything. It seems like most men aren't getting one night stands by the boat load so it isn't missed sexual opportunities. What is it?",There's no way to put an accurate number on it but with modern dating it seems likely that the majority of women go for a small percentage of men and the majority of men don't get much attention from most women. Or at least on online dating apps. So basically you have very popular men who know they have options and the ones who want long term commitment find what they want and leave the dating pool quickly while the remaining guys are just looking for hookups and have plenty of options to choose from.
dating,12rbktb,2023-04-19 01:14:53,Why has ghosting become so common and acceptable?,"This used to not even really be a thing. Not enough of one to have a term for it like ghosting. The past several years it's happened to me several times out of nowhere (always fairly early on within a month or so, not when in a long relationship), when things seem to be going very well. Sometimes right after they say something to the effect of they're looking forward to next time. After a few times it can really fuck with your head. Hard to give something a chance when even if things seem to be going VERY well with no bad signs of anything, there's a good chance that at any moment you'll never hear from the person again and have no idea why. One one hand I want to say I'm done with dating. On the other hand I know I can't just be celibate, lol.

If he ghosts you let it go yet why do a lot of men not get the hint when a woman stops responding? 

It just makes them try harder and looks desperate or creepy. Yet why do men keep doing it? There's a fine line between pursuing and coming off like a psychopath. I have to verbally tell them to stop or I'm not interested anymore and even then it's a 50/50. They'll either get mad, get the hint and finally give up or theyll say well hit me up if you change your mind.

dating,117uemo,2023-02-21 04:30:15,Women bringing up boyfriend when initially meeting,"Why do women bring up the fact they have a partner when we first start talking?

Before you start typing, I know the obvious answer would be that they aren't attracted and they don't want you hitting on them or something.

Here is the thing: I don't talk to them with the intent of dating or getting to know them as a future partner.

For example:

Recently I went to get a haircut. The barber was a woman that was around my age (20's). We start off the conversation normally and somehow she was talking about how her husband is lactose intolerant. So within the first minute of sitting down, I knew she wasn't single. The conversation goes on well for the next 10 minutes and she's asking me all these questions about school, work, and company. I tell her I'm going to be moving for an internship and so on the conversation goes...

Then, of course, I didn't want to make things quiet and awkward so I start asking questions about her. Like where she's from, and how things are going. One of my questions was ""How long ago did you get married""? And she goes how did you know that? I say didn't you just tell me a whole story about how he's lactose intolerant? She thinks hard and was like yeah...

This isn't the first time this happened with women when I talk to them. I just don't get it and not to sound pretentious & egotistical, but I would consider myself decently well-put. Are they trying to get a reaction out of me? Makes no sense

Would love to hear your input.","They just want to nip any flirtation in the bud. Part of being a young man. Don‚Äôt let it bother you, hopefully a future girlfriend would do the same when dating you."
dating,10a0c9w,2023-01-12 14:00:52,The game of dating is changing,"I‚Äôve been looking around in lectures and I see more women than men. The people with the highest grades are also women and I‚Äôve started to see more female doctors than male. 

Then I look at the current dating culture and men are still expected to provide. Pay for dates etc‚Ä¶ and I feel like very soon there will be a shift in paradigma. Because this isn‚Äôt sustainable anymore, soon there will be women with the big jobs paying most of the bills. The men will start taking a second seat and we can‚Äôt really see them as providers anymore because we are the main source of income. I saw an article that in 2030, 45 of women will be single and I just don‚Äôt find that realistic. 

People still fall in love and want to create a life with someone. But I do believe there will be a big change in how we approach dating. And I think it‚Äôs good, I am glad that women have more of an equal opportunity and maybe with the change it will lesser the burden of men in dating situations. No more feeling like they are a safety net or a bank account, women are with them for who they are.",[deleted]

How can someone be so evil as to rationalize keeping someone in a relationship / situationship while also being unsure of what they want and actively looking for someone to replace their partner? 

It's spoken about so casually. I don't get it. As an adult aren't you supposed to realize that you're inflicting horrible trauma on your partner that will take years or even decades to resolve? Aren't you supposed to stop for a second and say ""hm, well maybe I should stop traumatizing them and wasting their time""? Especially when one of them is more in love with the other one. I genuinely do not understand how childish this behaviour is, and yet it's basically the norm in our society. 

Don't get me started on the ""oh we're just using each other"" trope. Nope. I will never understand how people will go out of their way to minimize entire months or years of time spent with another person. 

I think people use it as a flex, to an extent. For instance, they have such a good support system you can fall back on to whisk them away at a moments notice, so they blindly allow themselves to step on other people and form situationships while narcissistically focusing on their personal melodramas. Most people don't have the luxury of being able to go on a bunch of vacations or 'busy themselves' with their incredible lives after experiencing something so devastating. So why are we letting these types of people walk all over everyone else. 

Any time I hear a story like this one, I immediately think of Jennifer Coolidge's character from the white lotus - just completely delusional.

Women use height as one of the most important traits for a deal breaker. It doesn't matter if you just want a taller guy, the fact that you do means you still care about it. Most guys don't care all that much about height and it's not always a deal breaker. I'm 5'4 and get told I'm too short on a constant basis. I increase my height to 6'0 on apps and get matches left and right. The women that are shorter than me don't give me a fucking chance at my regular height. As soon as I increase my height to a tall guys height, it's like bees swarming to a hive of honey. Not only that, but a lot of women are more likely to be attracted to a more muscular guy. Skinny guys are often a no go. Skinny or fat guys are literally told to go to the gym to increase attractiveness, like wtf? Women can be as thin as a pencil and it's perfectly attractive

. God forbid men are Skinny. Men can't even be insecure either. It's like if men were to have a little tiny bit of insecurity then he's not worthy of being with anyone and every woman on the planet will automatically be repulsed.

Published in July in the¬†Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, the research project involved three studies, one observational and two experimental.


In the first study, 56 pairs of men and women ‚Äî single, heterosexual Israeli university students ‚Äî discussed a problem in one of their lives. In the second and third studies, participants sent online chats about a life problem to someone they thought was a person of the opposite sex; in reality, they received an automated reply that was either responsive or unresponsive to their woes.

When participants rated their conversation partners for responsiveness, sexual attractiveness and how typical they seemed for their gender, on average the males labeled responsive women as more feminine and therefore more sexually attractive as a potential partner.

Yet the female participants were, on average, slightly less attracted to men who seemed more responsive, viewing such responsiveness as a feminine quality. They were more attracted to men they found masculine, meaning not necessarily very responsive.

‚ÄúResponsiveness may signal to a potential partner that one is concerned with her or his welfare, and may therefore increase sexual interest in this person,‚Äù according to the report‚Äôs summary. ‚ÄúResearch shows, however, that this proposition holds true for men, but not for women.‚Äù

Birnbaum and fellow researchers Tsachi Ein-Dor of IDC, Harry T. Reis of the University of Rochester (where Birnbaum did her post-doc after earning her PhD in psychology at Bar-Ilan University in 1998) and Noam Segal of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign theorize that there may be a brain mechanism that could explain why men and women in their small sample displayed differing sexual reactions to a responsive opposite-sex stranger.

‚ÄúStudies 1 and 2 showed that men, but not women, perceived a responsive stranger as more gender typical (masculine/feminine) and, in turn, as more attractive. Study 3 revealed that responsiveness increased men‚Äôs perception of [a] partner‚Äôs femininity. This, in turn, was associated with higher sexual arousal, which was, in turn, linked to greater partner attractiveness and greater desire for a long-term relationship,‚Äù they write.

‚ÄúThese findings suggest that whether responsiveness affects perceptions of partner attractiveness varies in individuals, depending on the contextually based meaning of responsiveness.‚Äù

They theorize that many women may rate responsiveness as a less important factor in determining a man‚Äôs masculinity and attractiveness.

‚ÄúMen can be sexually appealing in various ways, which are not necessarily associated with expressions of intimacy, whereas women apparently have to be responsive to be appealing,‚Äù said Birnbaum.

But because not every woman in the study downplayed responsiveness as a typically male behavior, the researchers caution against drawing any wide-ranging conclusions.

What a joke. If you are a man, BE STOIC AND COLD WITH WOMEN. Its the only way to be sexually attractive! DON'T OPENLY SHOW YOUR EMOTIONS TO WOMEN! It ALWAYS KILLS sexual attraction!!",I don't give creedance to surveys and studies like these.
dating,jldroj,2020-10-31 06:37:31,"I spent a lot of time on this in another thread, so I thought I'd post it here too. Advice from a former ""player"" on how to spot one.","I am a ""reformed"" total POS who used to use women like kleenex (don't ask). I cheated on EVERY SINGLE ONE of them except the first, and I never gave a crap about 95% of them or even remember their names to this day (yeah, yeah, cliche, I know).

Why am I ""reformed"" you ask? Did I see the error of my ways organically? Am I a ""nice guy?"" Heck no. I gained a bunch of weight, had a daughter, and got a divorce. Those three things made me realize (1) I couldn't get women as easily as I used to, (2) I started thinking about dating them from the ""that's somebody's daughter, and how would I want my daughter treated"" perspective (ughhh), and (3) being divorced with a kid is a deal-breaker for virtually all of the hottest/most eligible women my age.

I now have a girlfriend I am 100% dedicated to.

Therefore, I believe I am in a unique position to illuminate the differences between a douche and a ""real man.""

1.) Does he seem too good to be true (not in your head but objectively)? He may be a douche. The best example of this is always saying the ""right thing"" at the ""right time.""

2.) Does he either say little things that make you think he may be controlling or show you a lot of interest sometimes but very little others (inconsistent)? He may be a douche.

3.) Is he secretive/very private about things and says things like, ""I don't want you talking about me to your friends?"" He may be a douche.

4.) Is he often busy without good reasoning and doesn't seem to make much of an effort? He may be a douche. Some may argue this just means he doesn't like you, but let's be honest, 99% of the time there's only one reason he keeps you around when he really isn't that into you.

5.) Does he avoid meeting friends and family or having you meet his friends and family? He may be a douche.

6.) Does he always want to be alone with you and rarely wants to go on actual dates? He may be a douche.

7.) Do his actions not match up with his words (words are cheap)? He may be a douche.

8.) Does he have primarily female friends/followers on his social media? He may be a douche.

9.) Do the things he says not add up (lots of contradictions, back-tracking, etc.)? He may be a douche.

10.) This is the most difficult one. Be honest with yourself. Try to be as objective as possible. Would you date you if you were him? If the answer is no, he may be a douche. Douchebags often go for the low-hanging fruit.


Always ask yourself, what advice would I give to my girlfriend if a guy treated her like this. Then take that advice.

Uhm excuse me, where has society went? Definitely downhill","The point is that being nice is a quality of being a good human. Everyone should be nice, to people they‚Äôre interested in and to people they‚Äôre not. Being nice does not mean that behavior should be expected to get a reward. It‚Äôs a quality to have because it‚Äôs the right thing to do. The issue with ‚Äúnice guys‚Äù is that they think merely because they‚Äôre nice, they deserve to be rewarded with sex or a relationship.

dating,8t4hg7,2018-06-22 20:20:18,Why do fat girls keep liking me?,"This has been happening to me as far back as high school. Every time I make friends with an overweight/obese girl, I find out later that they like me. I'm okay with girls that are a little curvy, but not so obese that they don't take care of themselves. I never like those girls, I don't make an effort to get that close to them, I just treat them like I do any of my friends, I laugh with them and treat them with respect and politely listen to them when they need to talk. I hate it when this happens because the feeling is never mutual and they end up getting their feelings hurt, which makes me look like the bad guy. I'm turning 26 this July and I've only had one girlfriend in my life back in high school, and even that didn't last very long. It just sucks that I have such bad luck at attracting the wrong women, and not just fat obese girls, but even normal looking girls that turn out to be annoying or badshit crazy. Why does this happen? What is it I'm doing? What can I do to make sure someone I'm not attracted to doesn't fall for me?",Why do guys fall for pretty girls they‚Äôre friends with? It‚Äôs normal for people to fall for attractive people. It‚Äôs even more likely to happen when they don‚Äôt get very much attention from other guys. The reason high quality girls don‚Äôt just fall for guys is because they have a lot of options. Options make you more emotionally secure. A lack of options makes you more likely to fall. 
dating,tjx73d,2022-03-22 07:09:00,Taking to a new guy I‚Äôm not all that attracted to physically,"So I (24f)recently started talking to this guy (28)who found me on Instagram through a dating app. Before we met in person I saw his pictures and we talked on the phone a few times. His face isn‚Äôt ugly or anything like that and he had a nice voice so I was down to meet up. In person he‚Äôs a bit on the shorter side -I‚Äôd be taller than him in my lowest heels- and he‚Äôs not my typical type body wise he‚Äôs chubby and normally the guys I‚Äôve been with have all been pretty anal about their workout regimen and things like that. 

We‚Äôve hung out a few times and he‚Äôs really nice, unintentionally funny and considerate [this is the beginning so idk if he‚Äôs going to stay that way] but there was no immediate attraction so the other day I went over to his apartment with the intention of letting him know I saw him more as a friend than a partner. Somehow he got his mouth around my nipple and we ended up having sex with a condom and It was really good like the best sex I‚Äôve ever had with a condom. 

I hate condoms because I‚Äôve never had a good time with them on so I normally just wait until I‚Äôm in a committed relationship and we both know we‚Äôre clean and feel comfortable going raw 

Now I‚Äôm conflicted because we hung out tonight and had sex again and again üë®üèΩ‚Äçüç≥üëçüèΩü§™. If his personality stays the same I could see something long term but I‚Äôm not attracted to him until AFTER we start the foreplay and all of his foreplay isn‚Äôt all that 
‚Ä¢he was laying on my chest so his hand had easy access to my crotch area and he did this weird thing where he rubbed the hard part of his palm on the outside of my vagina kinda hard it started to burn a lil and that‚Äôs when I was like ‚Äúthis guys a virgin were for sure just gunna be friends‚Äù. This was literally right before the nipple sucking so I hadn‚Äôt said anything about only being friends yet‚Ä¢ 
The thing is I like to be dominant at times, like I‚Äôll lay back and take it no problem but when it‚Äôs my turn you better be ready,plus I know guys don‚Äôt always want to initiate the sex but I don‚Äôt see myself starting anything. When I was riding him the faces he made were kinda ugly and I know sex faces aren‚Äôt cute but‚Ä¶. 

I don‚Äôt want to ask him to change because he‚Äôs comfortable as he is or so he seems but I think I‚Äôd be more attracted to him if he were to gain some muscle. Also this is only the beginning of the relationship so it doesn‚Äôt feel right to even think about talking to him about it because what right do I have??? So what do I do?? 


Also side note our last round of having sex we were doing it from behind and he took the condom off and said he came (in the condom) but I didn‚Äôt feel it -he cums very animatedly so I‚Äôd‚Äôve noticed- then he went to the bathroom and came back and layed down then asked me to give him head which I find odd because we just went 2 rounds and you literally just came so why???? I think he might have stealthed me if I hadn‚Äôt been paying attention but I didn‚Äôt say anything because I didn‚Äôt wanna be paranoid, I had an ex do it so I made sure to be on the look out since I admittedly dont know him very well. I‚Äôd appreciate thoughts on this too.


Edit: I‚Äôd like to clarify he‚Äôs not ugly, I don‚Äôt mind being seen with him, I‚Äôm not embarrassed or anything like that and while someone a bit taller would be preferred his height isn‚Äôt a dealbreaker. It‚Äôs just he‚Äôs soft as me and I‚Äôm not used to that. Ive always said if I can‚Äôt see my partner picking me up or defending me I wasn‚Äôt interested and I don‚Äôt see that rn

Edit #2: Thank you to those who actually tried to see things from my side instead of just judging. I wanted to address some things 1.I listed things I liked about him those if you saying I don‚Äôt like him please feel free to reread. 2. I didn‚Äôt mention his diet because I don‚Äôt know his eating habits yet and don‚Äôt want to jump to conclusions. He works in the medical field so I‚Äôd assume that he eats healthily. But if I were to judge by the past it‚Äôs probably not that great. 3. I find it concerning that so many of you glossed over the side note. Maybe I shouldn‚Äôt be looking for advice here.","My ex always told me, ""you're not my type"" but we dated for about 3 years before she left me for some guy that was her ""type"" so idk don't lead the dude on even if the sex is decent"

I wasn‚Äôt really expecting anything but I kinda got my hopes up after his girl BFF‚Äôs bday last month. He showed me what he got her and was excited about it. I thought wow, I wonder what he would get me for my bday at the time. So I guess I‚Äôm comparing myself to his bff here but I‚Äôve known him longer than her and they got closer faster but I can‚Äôt lie, I feel pretty hurt by it. He‚Äôs always talking about how he‚Äôs a romantic and if I was his gf I would see how, but he did the bare minimum and it honestly made him less attractive in my eyes.

dating,ehpz4u,2019-12-30 18:36:36,I (29F) went on 5 dates with a guy (32M) who approached me,"So venting because I need to after my most recent experience. I went on a 5th date this past weekend with a guy who approached me in my apartment complex about grabbing a drink. We have seen each other around for awhile and chatted every so often so it wasn't totally out of the blue for him to ask. We had a great time on all of the dates, even discussing some previous relationships and our views on things on the last date. I go back to his place and again are talking about relationships and I say well, my intention is to seriously date at this point in my life and he responds, seemingly rehearsed, that he is not and having just got out of a relationship he just wants to have fun. I think that's great for him to do if he isn't ready for a relationship, however then you should not be approaching people (especially those who you live near and will run into often) and go on multiple dates.... Obviously I wish I would have brought this up much sooner.  I'm not sad about him necessarily, I think I am just pissed that this person wasted my time and/or assumed I would be ok with ""just having fun."" Maybe rhetorical questions but why do I have to be upfront about my serious intentions but it's ok for people to not be up front about their lack of serious intentions? Why are grown men who have completely ruled out the idea of a relationship going out with women at all? Because they are bored? Give me a break. Going into 2020 single and truly couldn't be happier based on the men I have met recently.","Wait I'm confused. It doesn't seem like he did anything wrong but you are blaming him for something.

>why do I have to be upfront about my serious intentions but it's ok for people to not be up front about their lack of serious intentions?

Didn't these intentions come about at the same time? Like you said your goal, and he responded with his goal? That would make you both equally as up-front, right?

>I think that's great for him to do if he isn't ready for a relationship, however then you should not be approaching people

How else should he go about having fun? Wait for people to approach him? What would that even solve?

>Why are grown men who have completely ruled out the idea of a relationship going out with women at all?

...because that's how you ""just have fun"". Do you know a better way? other than going out with women? He's a grown man, he can do what he wants. He doesn't owe you, or anyone, a relationship."

dating,nxyude,2021-06-12 04:49:54,"I keep attracting the wrong type (dominant men), it's annoying. What can I do to change this?","Not sure if it's mostly due to my short stature (5'4 ft), my personality, or both, but I keep attracting dominant men and it's just getting annoying.

I had 3 relationships and 5 other flings (all younger than me) through my lifetime, but I always ended up frustrated by their dominating manner. 

It annoys me that my men were trying to take charge in our relationship and dictate my life. As if they were challenging my freedom and independence, I detest this. I know what I want. I already have all plans and projections of my own future. Respect my decision. Even on small things like date night, I want them to understand that **I** decide where and what to do. When I ask for a date, just get ready and I will pick you up on time. Don't plan ahead. *I lead*. Just join me. 

It irritates me even more that some men thought I wanted an alpha man to challenge me. Why would I want that in a relationship? I want a submissive and receptive man I can protect, mommy around, keep him safe, help and guide him on the right track. 

I don't know how I can attract the right type of people and achieve this dynamic. I consider myself quiet decent, even charming. An independent young woman with a STEM degree from a top university, I even work two jobs while still maintaining a 3.5 GPA. I have a great physique, not as buff as professional weightlifters, but *buff*. Still, whenever I find a potential submisive partner and try to make the first move, most aren't interested. Some even ghosted me.

Edit: Thanks for the advices. I think I do need to communicate further about what I want in a relationship before starting one. And to clarify the faq: 1) I'm drawn to my exes because they appear (and are sexually) submissive, I didn't know they're actually quite dominant in a relationship. 2) No, I am not attracted to masculine-but-gentle men. Sissy/effeminate boys fit my taste though. And no, I don't think of submissiveness as a form of whimp or immaturity. Women in traditional/conventional relationships (especially one with DDLG vibes) act this way all the time and no one accuse the women as whimpy or immature, I think submissive men should be treated with the same respect.","As a guy who used to be passive and let the woman lead, I can tell you that keep doing whatever you‚Äôre doing to attract this type of men: ask them out and take initiative. 

But if you‚Äôve never dated a passive guy, I‚Äôd like to warn you of some pitfalls that you should watch out for:
1) the man might get used to being taken care of and might get comfortable to the point that a lot of effort you‚Äôre doing might get taken for granted. 
2) the man might likely never put any effort to do anything for you such as bring you flowers, or any other romantic gestures. 
3) you might end up basically carrying both your children and him (another child of yours) on your shoulder. And when things get tough, he might not even offer you the emotional support (because he never got to properly emotionally develop). 

There are some dominant women in my family that ended up with passive guys, and they didn‚Äôt seem to be happy. 

I‚Äôd say if you do want a passive guy, at least get a man who you could ‚Äútrain‚Äù and do the things you want. Because without ‚Äútraining‚Äù the man might never mature and stay like a child even when he is an adult."

Or does it mean most women are garbage?","If you designed a new food that >95% of people spat out the second they tasted it, even if <5% could tolerate it and say ""yeah I guess it's okay,"" you'd probably conclude you had a pretty terrible recipe.

Similarly, if your race and height make most women reject you before they are even willing to talk to you, then the obvious conclusion would be you're a pretty terrible recipe yourself.

Alternatively, you could say if the majority of an entire gender only cares about your height and race, then the majority of that gender are terrible. Many people consider that ""misogyny,"" although I've been told that interpretation by many women (including my own mom). Eg. ""If a woman only cares how tall/white you are, she's not worth knowing.""

Which do you think is the more favorable explanation?

One leads to seeing yourself as garbage (accepting the physical criteria of women as valid) and the other leads to seeing most women as garbage (for judging human value based solely on height and race).

I personally don't see either as ideal. I suppose both are probably true.","My advice honestly; stop dating. Stop going out and trying, and spend that time and money on a therapist. It‚Äôs not your height or your skin, it‚Äôs that enormous chip on your shoulder that women see and it makes them run the other way."
dating,h7xp9y,2020-06-13 01:23:48,"Dear women, If you go to a club/bar and you get all dolled up and you get hit on by guys, it should not be a surprise to you if you get hit on.","I might piss off a lot of people with this post, but I just really don't care. 

Women if you go to a bar or club (places where it is common place for people to go to in order to hook up or find a new bf/gf) and you get all dolled up,  then it's stupid for you to get mad when guys hit on you as long as they do it in a respectful way.

I find it hilarious when I go to a club/bar and I see a woman that has her hair done, make up done, nails done, and is clearly wearing clothing that will make her look as attractive as possible, and then I approach her respectfully and she is taken by surprise that I am approaching her. This is about as stupid as it gets. 

This is literally like the equivalent of me going to job fair, wearing a suit and tie, and carrying a briefcase full of resumes with me....then when I get approached by potential employers, I'm like, ""Why are you approaching me with job offers?...That's weird.""

dating,e6ufw0,2019-12-06 05:43:43,I AM SO SICK OF MEN RANT,"I am so fed up with men. The way they use an abuse women disgusts me. I see it with me, my friends, and my guy friends who do it and think it's funny. I don't get it?? Do humans not value other humans anymore? Look, sometimes you just want to be fwb, or dip out on a girl because you're not feeling it- but there is a way to go about things!! Do we not have common decency this day in age. If I had a dollar for every guy that dies to date me and as soon as we have sex, he dips out....I would have at least $20. Which is fine, if that's what you want then that's what you want- but don't lie, don't be deceitful, and at the very least have the common decency to tell a girl ""hey I just wanted sex, sorry but don't want to talk anymore."" I mean for the love of god what is our culture. Is it so hard to send a text to someone saying you don't want to talk anymore? Especially someone you have literally been inside of! Grow a pair and send a text. We really have to revert to ghosting, it is so pathetic. 

And I am not talking about the guys that are obvious douchers. I am talking about the manipulative, sociopaths who lie for months just to get laid. The guys that take girls out, tell her everything she wants to hear, lies straight to her face, just to get in her pants and then disappear. And somehow women get blamed for it. ""Oh you slept with him too soon,"" ""oh you should never trust anything he says,"" ""you really think guys want a relationship,"" yada yada. Here's my thing, I would like to be able to trust what men say. I don't want to be jaded for the rest of my life. I would like to be able to have sex without worrying if he's gonna dip out after- but they make it impossible!! I am so jaded by the countless men who have lied straight to my face just to get one thing. And I am a laid back girl. If you want to be fwb, I am in. If you want to date, share feelings, be in a relationship, then I will consider it. But be honest. Don't act like a knight in shining armor and then shape shift into a piece of scum overnight. 

And another thing!! So many dudes act like it is a numbers game for them. They will have sex with a girl, it will be great, and yet they have a compulsion to move on to the next. Ummmm is there something wrong with having sex with the same girl more than once? Are you afraid that one day you will magically wake up in a relationship with her? Yeah that's not how it works. If the sex was good, why do you have to go sleep with 100 other women? Our vaginas are all the same bro...what are you looking for, the world's tightest vagina??? You trying to have sex with a virg?

dating,db66o5,2019-09-30 04:06:22,Women in OLD,"I don‚Äôt think guys in general understand how OLD works for women. Guys only see what they think are benefits. 

They see the $5 or free cover charge for getting into the club, but conveniently ignore the groping, harassing, constant creeping, vague or not-at-all vague gross comments, unnecessary touching; the hair, the makeup, the outfits, the shoes; the ever present psychological warfare (whether you know it or not, ladies). 

That was a metaphor btw not looking for any people picking that a part because it has nothing to do with OLD *eyeroll*

Meaning: it‚Äôs not all fun and games for women on OLD just because we have so many matches. The number of matches aren‚Äôt everything. 

Honestly, they‚Äôre not anything.","Hundreds of matches are always better than zero matches. That's not debatable. Because if you have zero you have zero opportunity.

dating,9mxq4t,2018-10-10 08:46:14,I hate it when people say that you have to improve your personality to have better success with women,"I know many guys in relationships. 80% of them don't have a good personality. Those guys are loud, attention grabbing jerks who don't care about anyone. Other 20% are nice, smart and caring guys.

If women cared more about personality and less about confidence, this world would be a better place.

Btw, just because you have confidence, it doesn't mean that you have a good personality.","You don't get to decide what other people are attracted to, nobody does.  You just get to work on yourself.  The sooner you stop worrying about what other people have to offer and worry about what YOU have to offer, the sooner you'll begin improving yourself and your date-ability."
dating,9erqqu,2018-09-10 22:24:09,Men might be less inclined to make the first move nowadays,"Because in any environment where there is some sort of administration it‚Äôs simply not worth it.

Because at any time, if an advance by a guy is rejected, that girl could approach the administration and get him in trouble.

For example, if its on college campus: Guy approaches girl, asks for her number or asks her out or whatever his methods may be. If she does not like it, she can go to the school administration, file a sexual harrassment claim saying the advance was unwanted, and that she may not feel safe with him around, and that guy just got kicked out of school.

If it‚Äôs at work: Same deal, guy tries to ask out a co-worker, she can go to HR, state the same thing, the advance was unwanted, she doesnt feel safe around him now, and he just got fired.

Any environment where there is some type of administration overhead has now become a place where a guy cannot make any first moves because if the girl were so inclined, she could escalate the encounter into one of not feeling safe and the guy just got kicked out\fired.

The environments where a guy can make the first move have been significantly reduced in recent years.

Imagine if you as a girl, approached a guy in college, asked for his number, he rejected you and if he was so inclined, informed the school your approach was unwanted, and now he feels unsafe around you. Now you just got kicked out of school, or faced disciplinary action, on record.

This is reality in America

Attempts at dating anywhere outside a bar, online,or on the street have become detrimental.

It sucks, speaking as a guy, because I see plenty of girls id like to get to know more, on a daily basis, but no girl is worth losing my job, or my education over.","Nobody is going to run to the administration for asking for their number  * rolls eyes.

They might go if the way you asked was 'hey sexy, that mouth would look good on my cock. what's  your number?` 

Or you followed her for 5 blocks at night until deciding to ask her on an unlit street.

  And they would be completely right to do so because then you would be a creep who should be kept away from women. 

Don't be a douche and no one will treat you like one. Simple really.

Also, don't date people a work. On all levels it's a terrible idea.

dating,92ocla,2018-07-28 18:37:31,Why i feel online dating isn't worth it for women who want a relationship,"I'm a 24F and have been online dating for a few years. Here are the reasons why i feel it usually doesn't work for women (or even men) who want a relationship. Now I'm not saying EVERYONE is like this online, but this is generally what i find to be wrong. 

1,) Large amounts of men on there just want sex or something ""casual"". Sometimes they'll lie to you and lead you on and say that ya maybe i will look for something more, i just go with the flow etc. But usually they're just trying to lead you on, they want instant gratification and lose interest in actually going on steady dates. 

2,) Most are losers in some way. NOT ALL, Most guys on there can't find a gf in real life, because theres something wrong with them (Again not ALL i'm just saying in general) Its very rare to find a guy you mesh well with that has his shit together, motivated in life, and a good person. I have been looking for years and still haven't found one, i don't want to be in my 40s and still dating online. 

3,) I feel like men online obviously get way more choices in women to match with and they kind of get addicted to it. For example, i dated a man i met online for a few months, he wanted me to be his gf and everything seemed to be going ok. Recently, i saw that same dating app on his phone, and decided to make a fake female account and sure enough, i started talking to him. As the fake account I asked him what he was looking for, he said he was looking for a girlfriend! (When we were obviously still dating and he didn't mention a break up to me). And that with the last girl it just didn't work out LOL. My point is, i feel like these guys get addicted to talking to other women on there, and they get into this mentality that theres always someone better. So even if you actually make it to a relationship with them, they might end up getting bored one day or missing flirting with other women, or just curious to see who else is new on there. So being that they already have this habit, they will probably at some point get back on there..

Did you ladies or men have similar experiences like this with online dating? I'm kind of getting sick of it and its a lot of time and energy",[deleted]
dating,10iobkk,2023-01-22 17:00:52,Are sex robots going to solve the problem of single men?,"I have been getting a lot notifications from this sub where men are basically complaining about their sex lives and how hard it is for them to get a girlfriend or something like that.

Well, I already know that many of you are going to comment that sex robots will never replace real women. But hear me out: what if companies creat super realistic looking sex robots that look no different than a real woman and are also supported by super advanced AI. These robots will not only be able to provide sex, but they can also have conversations with you like a normal person. They can give professional therapy. You can program them to love you unconditionally or force you to become a better version of yourself. They will look like and even behave like super models and actresses. And they will also be very affordable. The possibilities are endless.

I personally believe that as a society, this is our only option to solve the problem of single men. I mean what else can we do? Nature has designed women to be extremely choosy so a lot of men will never be able to be attractive to women and find a mate. We cannot force women to have sex with men that they do not find attractive. If you have any other options that is better than affordable super realistic AI sex robots then I will absolutely listen to you.","Or, I dunno, men could also work to improve themselves and become better partners?"

Both on dates and at salsa dancing I‚Äôve had women ask me if I‚Äôm working, and when I say no they look visibly disappointed and disinterested.

You're answering the question wrong! Tell them you're a 3rd year law student on your way to becoming a lawyer.

dating,ufwn6x,2022-05-01 09:58:16,"So many men I(23f) meet or hear about seems to be attracted to teenage girls, and it makes me feel kind of unsafe and insecure in dating. Help?","So many posts on here talk about it, we hear about i constantly in the media and from celebrities, there are litterally a porn category called teens or just turned 18, it's everywhere!

Not only that, but my entire life I have been called ""cute"", ""adorable"", ""the quiet shy girl"" like I'm a helpless little girl. Basically it has felt like people where infantilizing me. Yes, I am a quiet person, and I have insecurities (I struggle with my mental health, so some of it might be very visible to others). But I am also smart, and I have a personality! Now at 23 (soon 24) I continue to meet people (all genders) that call me by these adjectives, and it doesn't stop there; since I'm kind of petite, and maybe because I don't wear make up, I have always looked younger than I am. It's only two years ago someone mistook me for a 15-16 year old! I have never met someone who where not shocked to hear my actual age.

It has made me so self conscious! To the point that I suspect every man who show interest in me, to be a pedo. (other than the teen boys, those I just feel embarrassed for, and really icky). And I start to wonder, if it really is just my looks, or if I don't seem mature enough for my age. It has kind of given me a complex with not wanting to ask for help ever, and huge perfectionism in being good at everything, so I don't seem too much like a child or too ""adorable and cute"".

I have come to understand that most men are mainly visually stimulated, (which is what makes me suspect them if they show interest in me) but would most, if they want to date, not also look for personality and stuff like that, to see if were compatible and on the same maturity level? Obviously there are superficial types out there, who only care about looks. But people who are looking for a relationship would care at least, if not more, about personality and compatibility right?

If this is the case, then what makes a person seem mature? Since my looks make me look so young, how can I make sure that when people get to know me, there will be no questioning that I'm a teen? As I said, I do struggle with mental health so I'm not the most confident and outgoing person (and pretty inexperienced too). But I live on my own, I have a job, and I take responsibility for my life. I also have clear values, and many interests/hobbies. What else would make me seem mature and adult, to compensate for my looks?

Last question: what would give away that the man who is interested in me, is only into me because I look like a teen? Because I seriously fear, that guys I'm with are only with me because I'm the legal solution to their pedo fantasy.

Edit: Okay, so it seems like I didn't word my question right.. So of course I don't blame anyone for seeing an attractive person when it can be hard to know their age, and it turns out it's a teenager (as long as they drop it after finding out their age). This was not what I wanted to discuss/ask. What I am saying is that people litterally approach me, flirt with me, even ask me out, and then get surprised when they find out that I'm older than I look (aka not a teen). Also,  I have had too many very unpleasant experiences with people who call me ""cute/adorable"" in quite an infantilizing manner, and in the same sentence talk about sexual scenarios with me. This gives me the impression that the men who approach me, do so because they think I'm much younger than I am, and this seriously creeps me out. I don't want to attract men like those. I don't want to accidentally end up in a relationship with someone who gets off on that I look like a teenager. 

TDLR: I look like a teen and have been infantilized and called ""adorable and cute"" my whole life. So Now I feel insecure if the men who show interest in me, do so because they are pedos.","This is like saying so many women are attracted to tall men, it‚Äôs so weird it‚Äôs like they want to feel like a little girl with her Dad.

Youthfulness is biologically attractive to men, women are most fertile from late teens to late twenties, and if you are healthy during those ages you are often going to look young . It‚Äôs normal. I‚Äôm not saying older men should go around trying to date teenagers, obviously they shouldn‚Äôt, and most don‚Äôt, but youthfulness being an attractive trait isn‚Äôt news just in, and you can rarely tell somebodies age by looking at them, that isn‚Äôt being attracted to teenage girls, it‚Äôs being attracted to feminine traits and not knowing how old somebody is. Men look at (adult) feminine features such as hip to waist ratio, breasts, ass etc. If you are calling somebody a pedo for finding these things attractive just because some girls develop quite early, have these features and guys just walking past them don‚Äôt have a clue how old they are, they just instinctively notice‚Ä¶ I mean that‚Äôs a you problem, not a them problem. The fact you are an adult but say you look like a teenager, the more likely truth is that some teenagers look like adults and then men get labelled. It only becomes a problem when they find out a girl is young and continue to pursue, which most men don‚Äôt.

dating,ni0et8,2021-05-21 19:14:12,A Guide to OLD written by a woman to men,"I'm pretty new to OLD, but I see people (mainly men) complain about it, so I put together some observations/experiences I've had that might help.  (Edit: multiple posters have said this applies to women too so I wanted to add that. Also I added an 11th tip)


1. **Please actually enter something in your profile.**

If all I have to go on is your photo, then yes, I will judge you based on your physical appearance. I can‚Äôt see anything else. And bonus - please have more than one picture, especially if you're not going to fill out the profile. 

2.**In your profile, put something specific about you..**

Even if I don‚Äôt think someone is the most attractive, I‚Äôll swipe right if they sound interesting. Attraction can develop if we have similar interests. Your bio gives you a shot to show a peek of who you are. Don‚Äôt waste it.

3. **Please no group shots. If you must use them, then max 3 people and make sure they‚Äôre at the end.**

It is a waste of time to look through and see which person is you, especially in the first picture. Just please max 1 group shot.

4. **Please no bathroom selfies, especially if you aren‚Äôt wearing a shirt.** 

It‚Äôs not as impressive as you think. I‚Äôd much rather see a pic with you at the gym or doing something physical than just abs and a toilet in the background.

5. **You‚Äôre better off not posting a picture with another woman (unless you‚Äôre looking for a third)**

Anytime I see a woman in a picture I wonder, is that his sister, his ex, a friend? Don‚Äôt open the door to these questions. Just post a picture of yourself. Also, not my cup of tea, but if you‚Äôre looking for a third, please post pics of both people. If you don‚Äôt, I always wonder if the girl even knows you‚Äôre doing this and it just makes me uncomfortable.

6. **If we match and you just say hey, I might not respond. If you say something that shows you read my blurb, it‚Äôs more likely to pique my interest.**

I filled out the blurb for a reason. I mentioned something about me. If all you do is say hey or comment on how pretty I am, it‚Äôs nice but I‚Äôm way more likely to respond to someone who took an interest in what I had to say.

7.**Show don‚Äôt tell**

If you‚Äôre a chef, post a pic of you cooking. If you‚Äôre an athlete, show a pic of you playing your sport. If you like to hike, show a picture of you on a hike. It adds credibility and makes for more interesting shots.

8.**Don‚Äôt ask weird/inappropriate questions that you wouldn‚Äôt ask in person.**

I‚Äôve had men ask about my racial background moments after saying hello. That leads to an automatic ghosting. It makes me uncomfortable and I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs not just me. I'm sure there are tons of other questions that people ask off the bat that are rude too (asking men their height is one that comes to mind). 

9.**Don‚Äôt lie about your age.**

Instant turn off. If you say ""I like more mature people"", then recognize its immature to lie about your age. Also, hiding your age doesn‚Äôt make me more likely to swipe right. It makes me wonder what you‚Äôre hiding.

10.**Accept you may not be for everyone.**

I know rejection (or perceived rejection) sucks but presumably you just aren't trying to match with any warm body. A good match is better than someone who annoys you every time they talk (or vice versa).

11.**Don't be afraid to alienate some people in your profile to attract the type of people you'd like to match with.**

I am big into a number of interests that are considered very nerdy. I put this up front in my profile because I know that guys who think that's cool will swipe right and the others will swipe left and that's exactly what l want. It's a waste of time to match with guys that would find it unattractive.",There's zero reason to gender this. This advice is commonly given to all people on this sub.
dating,k57tj5,2020-12-02 11:48:51,"Beta males are becoming more and more common, and this is dangerous","Hey there, 22M here. I've had my fair share of relationships, I love women and I always try to improve myself if there are any problems, but I know that for many men it's not like this. Many men, other than having an almost non existent sexual power, are afraid of commitment, afraid of being honest with their partner, afraid of doing or saying almost anything for the fear of screwing up. Most importantly, many men purposefully neglect their woman, preferring to play online videogames or watch Netflix, because ""she will always be there for me"" as if she is some kind of object that remains where you put it. Some time ago I had a relationship with a woman that had a ""boyfriend"" who knew of me, and even though they lived together they didn't even touch eachother and slept in separate rooms, I know this because I went there several times and when I didn't go me and her would call eachother almost 24/7. He took care of his PC and of his videogames, but I took care of his woman, and trust me I know how lonely that girl felt. I've learned that women want strong, manly, reliable men that can be sweet and kind to them, not weak little boys that don't know what to do with their lives. Women need to feel safe, protected and valued like the complex human beings they are, not treated like objects to use. You don't need to be a 2 metres tall muscular giant with a perfect face, heck I am 165 cm without any shoes on, but it's about being kind, reliable and manly in the time of need. Even though society will tell you you're a fascist for saying so, the truth is that manliness is fundamental for maintaining healthy relationships. What is unhealthy is the excess and the misuse of it that can lead to violence or, as it's happening more and more often among men, the lack of it",Lmao what a fucking troll...
dating,cr9fft,2019-08-16 17:14:26,"At 31, I'm pretty worried that I've completely fucked myself over in the realm of dating. What do I have to do?","I'm 31, 6'4, with an athletic build, I have a variety of active hobbies and interests, always eager to try new things but... I'm really struggling to find a match that I personally consider attractive. And it's really starting to concern me that I've completely fucked up. All the chances I had in my 20s with women I was attracted to, the women that I dated and slept with... now seem like they were just flukes. And these apps have me convinced I've spent all my luck back then and there's no hope left. I'm really not trying to be a terrible person but I seriously only match with women so below my means that it's really making me question my own outward appearance. I used to think I was somewhat attractive, as that's what my 20s have told me but now it just feels like a cold lie I fed myself. I truthfully never match with a woman who is near my height, never match with a woman who is equally in shape as I am, and in the very, very ultra rare chance that I do... she'll have multiple kids. I really like to think that I'm better than my matches but after years of being through this, seems like another lie I've convinced myself of. And honestly, if I had matches here and there that were comparable to my interests and level of attractiveness, I wouldn't complain. It's the fact that that *never* happens.

So, what are my choices? I really don't want to die alone and at 31 the clock seems to be running down to the wire for me if I want to settle down. Am I really going to have to settle for someone I don't find attractive? I want to approach women out in the real world but again, the years and years I've been on these apps have crushed my soul and have made me feel so low about myself worth and my appearance that I don't think I'm good enough for anyone that I'd considered because they probably swiped left on me. It's a stupid thing to be scared about, but it has me utterly fucking afraid.

edit: making this post ended up being far more detrimental than any rejection I've experienced online. Appreciate the feedback but some of you are straight up cruel.","> I'm 31, 6'4, with an athletic build, I have a variety of active hobbies and interests, always eager to try new things

Id say either this isnt true or you have a unattractive personality which drives women away.

dating,10rmj9y,2023-02-02 10:15:58,I (30F) am so annoyed with the guy (25M) I am casually dating right now. On my couch alone feeling unappreciated and undesired.,"So long story short we met after I had just come out of a relationship, he‚Äôs a great guy and usually I have nothing bad to say!

He is, however, totally emotionally unavailable for a real relationship. He states otherwise but, there‚Äôs some emotional growth that needs to happen there and regardless he stated he wants casual with me so here we are.

I‚Äôm ok with this because he‚Äôs engaging and fun! The sex is great, we have fun climbing and hiking together, we laugh a LOT, have great conversation, and he‚Äôs super affectionate. Even if it‚Äôs not forever, all of that feels great!

Except I am flabbergasted by how much of a jerk he was last night. As the username implies I‚Äôm a bit of a ‚Äúgranola‚Äù gal but I was like hey you know what, we haven‚Äôt seen each other in a week ‚Äî I‚Äôll get dressed up and make him a nice dinner when he gets here. 

So I threw on a dress, got a little extra fancy, and started in on making a really nice dinner for him.

When he got here, he was obviously visually interested and stoked on dinner, but he was stoned and on his phone THE ENTIRE DAMN TIME.

When we sat down to eat, not so much as thank you for cooking, you look nice, whatever. Just wanted to watch something over the rib-eye I had just made him.

At one point he slides his hand on my thigh, but that‚Äôs about it. He said he was just exhausted‚Ä¶which is fine, I totally get that that. But THE PHONE.

This is the same man who complains about women being unresponsive on the apps, not putting in effort, etc. His friends are actively trying to date me‚Ä¶all is to say, I don‚Äôt see this as a ME issue but it still sucks!

I‚Äôm currently on my couch just‚Ä¶annoyed. I can‚Äôt decide if I bring this up in the morning or try to be understanding about how tired he was. 

We cuddled until we fell asleep, I kissed him goodnight on the cheek, and he is currently asleep in my bed. 

I‚Äôm feeling just so‚Ä¶unappreciated and let down by his total lack of engagement that I couldn‚Äôt sleep.

Im usually pretty reasonable, my feelings as a friend/casual partner just are hurt as I feel super disrespected and undesired! Not exactly a winning combo when things are supposed to be fun :(.

Do I bother bringing this up in the morning or just move on? It sucks because I normally really enjoy his company, the most out of anyone I‚Äôm seeing, but crap do I feel unappreciated!","Whatever your situation is, I feel like if someone is making me a rib-eye it‚Äôs rude to be on my phone the whole time. People in the comments are flaming you for breaking the agreement and trying to be more than friends, but if my buddy cooked me a steak and I didn‚Äôt talk to him the whole time and stayed on my phone it‚Äôs a dick move. But that‚Äôs just like, my opinion man"
dating,10o1dzh,2023-01-29 06:54:41,I've approached dozens and dozens of women over the last 4 months and haven't gotten even a nibble.,"I just don't get it. I keep reading. Confidence, confidence confidencee. I don't think I am an ugly.man. I am a talented musician and an awesome dancer. Leople generally love me and think I am awesome. I get compliments all the time. The way I dress, the way I carry myself, my dancing, my music skills. I am bombarded with comoliments about all that shit.

But women arent attracted to me! No matter what I do. Best dressed guy in the venue. Well known with tons of social proof. I have a ton of friends and acquaintances. But fucking women are always ""meh"" about me and I have spent my entire adult life trying to figure it out.

The only thing I can come up.with is I am a really ugly.man. I have to be. No one goes out every weekend for several months on end, approaches women, is polite and non threatening. Yet still gets rejected over and over again..

I just want a woman I find attractive to smile at me, flirt with me, let me know the finds me attractive. Instead I get polite small talk and a soft rejection. I mean I put myself out there. I approach tables with 5 or 6 women. Very few men have the balls to do that. I figured that alone should get me some kind of brownie points with 1 or 2 girls somewhere. 

The only conclusion I can come too is I MUST be an ugly man. I hate to say that about myself but what other reason can there be? I carefully and studioisly eliminated every downside I have control over. 

I just don't know what to do because I.am tired of approaching girls and getting ""ho hum"" or ""meh"" reactions from girls.

For the last 3 months I have put myself out there time and time and time again. It's frustrating and it hurts because I am a really great catch. Wtf is it I am missing? I am well groomed, clean cut and have tons.of talents. I have an 8"" dick and know.how to use it. Wtf is it I am missing?","You're obsessed with it and you mistaken that for confidence.

but as a guy I have to be a literal clown and put a ton of effort into pleasing them as if they're queens, i'm sick of this , no wonder under 30 male virginity has tripled since 2010 and cel community is on the rise

it just hurts you know, being born in the wrong sex/body means you have 0 value as a person at online dating

&#x200B;

**edit :** for females who complain about having so many guys coming to them online that it's almost a joke, I want you to put yourself in their shoes for a moment, imagine being in a desert with no water. it just sucks and you'll be desperate for the first droplet of water you can find 

idk how else to describe it, and I know most of them are creepy but at least you have something coming at you in first place, you have the option to choose, to pick, we have nothing, it's unlimited supply of D for you vs empty supply of V for us","Okay dude, stop for a second. Let's get a few things straight. Women have it harder in life for a few reasons. Let's take it from my perspective, and remember, your problem is merely that you're lonely (and I feel you, I am too). I am not afraid to go out walking after dark, I don't have to worry about some creep following me. I don't have to worry about dudes around me and I don't have to wonder if they're trying to rape me. I don't have to worry about someone slipping something into my drink at a bar. I definitely never have to worry if the person hitting on me is actually interested or they just wanna fuck and leave. I don't have to worry about my job if my boss propositions me (which has even happened to a female co worker of mine). I don't have to wonder if my dude friends are really my friend or they're just trying to fuck me. I don't have to set up systems when I go on a date with my friends to ensure I don't get kidnapped, raped, or murdered. I don't have to worry if my next date is going to beat me. 

I don't have to worry because I'm a dude. I'm a 6'4 dude who is built like a tank, the world is more afraid of me than I am of it. Women tend not to have that luxury. 

You and I may be in a desert with no water, but they're stranded in the middle of the ocean with nothing but salt water. We're all lonely to some degree, just for different reasons, and your resentment isn't new and it doesn't come from your lack of dates. Your mentality doesn't come from a life of rejection. It comes from a sort of entitlement that you need to learn to shake. I know because I've been rejected my whole life from a ton of people but I still don't feel like they owe me a thing, I'd be happy if it works, but I won't lash out when it doesn't. No one is beholden to you, no one owes you anything. If you want a woman, you need to make yourself more desirable. And the first place I'd work on with you is how you think and see the world. Then be better physically.  Once you're in a more positive place, the more they'll come.

And before you give me the diatribe I've seen on your other posts, let me ask, what do you have to offer? What do you bring to the table? Why should someone be with you? I'm seriously asking. Sell me yourself."

dating,128l8kx,2023-04-01 12:40:47,my girlfriend(21) of 7 years cheated on me(23) after going abroad. All her friends called me crazy when I was right all along. Should I forgive her again and start over or move on.,"In 2021, my girlfriend got pregnant, and we had to do an abortion. It was due to financial reasons and the fact that her parents were reputable people in my country. Our next step was to apply for a student visa to move to Australia, but I was rejected, and I had to go to a Middle Eastern country to work my way up, and she went to Australia for studies, and we were hoping one day we could be together again. After 6 months away from me, she met a guy on Tinder, and they went on one date, smoking flowers (we both smoke, so it‚Äôs normal). He invited her to his place, and she did the deed, and she told me the next morning that he had forced himself on her. (This guy was from our same country.) And after that happened, I started talking to a girl and fell for her slowly. But me and my girl never stopped talking; some how, one day, she got to know about this and texted that new girl. They added me to a group call and said I was a bad guy for doing that to both of them. Then I asked my girl to come to the country where I live so we could be here and hopefully start a new life. And she came after a few weeks. She stayed with me for 4 months and got really sick. I took care of her like no other and gave her all the love and care I could muster. I feel like this is the time I fell in love with her again after she betrayed me; sadly, her parents again forced her to go back to Australia. So she had to leave. I only told her three times to stay with me. However, she had to listen to her parents, and I respected her decision and helped her go back to Australia. Then again, this time she went to another city to one of her friends' houses (a girl), and she's dating a local guy. During this time, she went clubbing with her friend and her boyfriend. The next day, she told me she had some drinks and had passed out. This was very odd for me. Everything was off again, and I know when I get this feeling that something is not right. I kept asking her if anything happened; she always said no, and then one day she accidentally sent me a screenshot of a guy's profile (that was meant to be sent to her best friend). I knew she would delete it, so I took a screenshot of it. Then I asked her who it was, and she told me that it was her friend's boyfriend. but still, it was off. So I texted that guy who was on the screenshot via Facebook, and she got pissed because of it. Then I had to know why she was acting like that and kept calling me crazy for doing that, so I called that guy. He told me that he's really the best friend of that other chick, and they met in the club and kissed each other while dancing, and after that they all walked back to her friend's place, where she was all over him, and while watching a movie, he fingered her. And he stayed the night, but they didn‚Äôt fuck. When I asked for it the first time, she denied it. Then I texted her friend and asked her to tell me the truth because it was her responsibility. She told me the truth, and my girl admitted it really happened after one whole week. And the reason for her doing that to me was because that guy made her feel happy at the club at first. When he kissed her, she kissed him back, so that means she was in for it and it was a conscious decision.

I feel lost and weak.

All her friends called me crazy when I was right all along.

Should I forgive her again and start over or move on? Moving on will be challenging for me.","Move on, mate."

Almost everything in my life is made by using logical decision making. Most people have told me that I am ""the strongest woman they know""

I usually treat my dates like an interview on the first date.

1. What is your attachment style?
2. What is your conflict style?
3. How many relationships have you had and how long? How did they end?
4. What are your emotional baggages and triggers?
5. Childhood traumas?
6. Financial stability. What are your goals in life?

And besides that I check for chemistry and compatibility. However, I noticed I seem to throw my filters away when I meet someone that is emotional (they usually are scattered brain too).

&#x200B;

I completely understand you're just not into them. But please don't ghost people. It drives the other person insane trying to figure out what they're doing wrong, and I know it seems rude or tough to do, but if you just tell them why you lost interest instead of just going dark and hoping they disappear, you might actually really help them find the next person and not carry the same problem over, unless of course it's something they can't change about themselves.

&#x200B;

If the problem is with their weight, height, age, personality, sexuality, religion, skin color, etc., it's still better that they know why you're not interested. Instead of you making them go through mental hell trying to figure out what they're doing wrong, tell them you're just not interested in dating people of different skin color or only date people who are above a certain height.

And yes, this is coming from someone who is currently left in the dark, trying to figure out what went wrong.

dating,y0mwgo,2022-10-10 18:58:42,The problem with online dating isn't men or women; it's pretty people,"People keep saying that men have it worse or that women have it worse.

I think the less attractive people have it worse, and the top 10% of both genders are trickle-down jerks -- not because they are inherently mean people necessarily, but because they have a ton of options and it's just human nature.

If you're in the top 10% of attractive women...I can say from experience in dating a couple of them as a man that these women generally do not have the ""men just wanna have sex and then they leave you alone"" problems the 90% of women I hear from often put up with. Multiple guys want LTRs with them. So they friendzone and use them because they can.

And these top 10% that all us guys anxiously swipe right on...don't wanna date us 90% generally due to being buried in so many much better options. And when they do they often leave us on read.

Same with top 10% of attractive men. They don't have the, ""women don't swipe right on me"" problem. The Tinder Swindler had 3-5 dates a day who funded his lavish lifestyle. They use women and move on, like the top 10% of women, because they can.

And us 90% of both men and women...are all getting by each other due to the trickle-down effects of the 10%.

I see this on dates. We meet in person and they're more attractive than their profile (like, maybe top 15% of attractive women), and don't seem quite as excited about me. They gripe about online dating and how they keep getting rejected by the the top 10% or whatever. Meanwhile, after the date they reject me, who is probably in the top 30% -- and by extension I can't even be mad, because I rejected someone else to make room for this more attractive person.

We're all being treated rudely by people more attractive than us, which creates a culture in which we are more likely to be rude (or consistently rejecting) to people just as or less attractive than us, and the only people not feeling the pain are those at the top of this abusive hierarchy.

It's just the way the game works. And ""settling"" doesn't work either -- if you don't really like the person you pair with, that makes for a hard LTR.

If there were fewer options it would be easier to get to know each other beyond the surface and develop something. But this swipe culture makes us get treated shallowly and makes us shallow...except for the most attractive people, who have their pick and can be abusive in their dating, ruining the reputation of the rest of their gender and making us all ruder, lonelier, and more disillusioned...even as we also contribute to the problem.

I dunno how to fix it. But that seems to be the big problem, clear as day. It's not men or women who are the jerks. It's the way that online dating empowers the top 10% of each gender to be trickle-down jerks.

Edit: Yes, of course there is more than attractiveness in choosing a partner ...especially if you are very attractive and overwhelmed with options. If you are less attractive and have limited options, you either get really lucky, settle, or be OK alone -- man or woman. Kinda like...of course there is more to having a nice life than money. But if you have money, you have more options and can be a bit pickier.","No it's people with unrealistic expectations, low effort and lack of self-awareness."
dating,ns6ajm,2021-06-04 14:21:40,Why would a lot of men would rather sleep around than date?,"This post is going to be a little controversial. A lot of people are going to get upset but I think it might be very helpful for some women if they want a better understanding of men.

I know a lot of women complain about how when using OLD a lot of men will open with something vulgar or something sexual will come up in the first few messages. They also complain about how men just want sex, and a lot of us (not most) just want sex. Here‚Äôs why:

A lot of them are sending out those messages just to get a girl that is also into those things. They know that it won‚Äôt work on a woman that wants a relationship because they don‚Äôt want to date. Because dating and trying to date is becoming increasingly not worth it for men. Let‚Äôs just think about this with an open mind for a second.

As said by one of the dating gurus I follow (she is a woman before anyone tried to call me a misogynist), ‚ÄúTo date as a woman, all you need is a smartphone and some patience. Dating as a man is like trying to win the lottery with a ticket you found on the ground.‚Äù This honestly is a very accurate statement. 

It‚Äôs significantly harder to get a date as a man than it is as a woman. There‚Äôs also significantly more that men have to do. Most men already have lower chances of getting a date, we also have to invest more money into a date, we don‚Äôt have many options whereas it‚Äôs easy for any woman to see multiple guys at once, we‚Äôre competing against pretty much every other guy in a 100 mile radius when a woman we‚Äôre seeing has no competition, and to top it off, a lot of this doesn‚Äôt change when you get into a relationship except you then have less time for your friends and self because you are trying to keep another person happy so she doesn‚Äôt leave you.

A lot of men just see it as being not worth the trouble. It‚Äôs too much financial, physical, and emotion strain and it‚Äôs easier to shoot a risky text to a girl we match with in the hopes that she might wanna hookup and never talk again.

Now I didn‚Äôt make this post to say that women have no struggles when dating, they do, but I don‚Äôt think they compare to men‚Äôs struggles.","Well said, though I want to add something that's probably going to be more controversial than what you've already said and that is the kind of men women are going for... Let's be real, although a lot of men do just want to sleep around, it's not as though men who want relationships don't exist, plenty do. However, you'll find that it's the men with options who women are selecting for and so it really shouldn't be a surprise that a man with options is going to prefer to sleep around rather than settle down. You'd have to be quite the catch yourself, as the woman wanting him, to convince him to settle for you."
dating,f4rm2e,2020-02-16 14:52:16,"Why I think dating is much harder as an average male, than an average female.","22 year old virgin guy here. There's a lot of posts of women saying that they have it harder. Men say no it is us who have it harder. Well the fact of the matter is we all have our own difficulties. Women may be bombarded with attention, but let's be honest, it tends to be very superficial. Men need to understand that someone wanting to have sex with you and move on to the next isn't very attractive nor is it what most women seek.

However, it is infinitely easier for women to get dates, based purely on the fact that men are expected to approach. It is far, far more likely for a shy woman to receive a date invitation than a shy man. On dating apps, women generally (and I mean generally) expect the man to send the first message, and expect the man to come up with a date venue and a date date. This means that a lot of pressure and responsibility is thrusted upon men.

Furthermore, if we look to the r/seduction sub reddit, it's apparent that a lot of men treat women with little respect. There was a post of how when a guy decided to insult women instead of compliment them, his success with women skyrocketed. Many young men read this kinda stuff and think, well shit if I don't do this and instead am a gentleman, women will avoid me. The men who respect women and try to avoid creeping them out are called nice guys and weak.

Now I'm not saying that being nice and cordial should instantly land you a date. It isn't even a basic requirement to have dates, as we can see that many men who employ tactics such as negging have much success. Being nice doesn't entitle you to date. But my point is that many men who are nice, and can't get dates, feel like they have to be like these men who haven't an ounce of respect for women in order to be liked by them. Essentially, being overly respectful and avoiding being a creep is far less successful than not giving a single fuck and to saying to a woman whatever you think, even if it is creepy. 

It feels like, for men, we have to act a certain way and behave a certain way in order to be noticed as sexual beings.

In conclusion, the main point is that women have it much easier to get dates, this can't be denied. Statistically then, they have a much higher chance of meeting someone they connect with than a man does.","where i start disagreeing with someone saying ""it's difficult for group x"" is when they say "". . .and it's easy for group y.""

it's not easy for anyone. everyone's eating a shit sandwich out there and it's stupid to argue over whose sandwich has more shit in it."

dating,102novk,2023-01-03 23:50:49,Causal sex problem. Help! Am I a bad person?,"Casual sex partner asked if I slept with someone else because I have vaginal tears.

Hey all,

I‚Äôve been doing the causal sex thing.

I was going pretty steady with one guy on Tinder. We met in October and been having casual sex for about two months now. We didn‚Äôt set boundaries on being with only one person. Half the time he doesn‚Äôt reply back to me so I don‚Äôt even know what he is doing and plus he lives and hour and a half from me. 

Then he didn‚Äôt respond for my texts and would leave me on read so I thought he lost interest and decided to sleep with another guy on Tinder.

We are by no means in a relationship, it‚Äôs just casual sex.

I had casual sex with guy number two and let‚Äôs just say it wasn‚Äôt great sex and the guy was kind of a jerk. 

So I was like well I guess I‚Äôll be celibate and lay low.

The Tinder guy number one who didn‚Äôt respond to me for about a week hit my up again.

Tinder guy number one wants to see me again but I told him i have micro tears in my vagina, which is true I do because Tinder guy number 2 didn‚Äôt use enough lube.

Tinder guy number one asked me if I had micro tears from sleeping with other peeps and I said no.

I lied and I feel so bad for Tinder guy number one.

Any advice? If I go back and tell him I did sleep with someone else, he is not going to be happy.

Also, is that breaking the casual sex rule? 

We are not together and plus tinder guy number 2 is done. I‚Äôm never speaking to him again. 

I had safe sex with the both of these guys so is it really Tinder Guy number ones business? Not trying to be rude. 

I think I may have told on myself. I feel bad and there is no way out of this now.","If you didn't have the exclusivity talk, you're both fair game. Just don't lie about it."

dating,130gt9p,2023-04-27 10:25:08,What are your biggest turn offs about men,"Saw a post about women and was curious about people's opinions on this one. Comment on anything whether general, in relationships, in the bedroom.","Dang, I got a whole list of things. Here are the ones that jump to mind straight away for me:

\- **Addictions** (weed is the most prevalent from what I gathered) they're not willing to give up on because they have past trauma. I'm very firm on that since I quit all my addictions and I'm now comfortable having the dark thoughts pop up because I know how to deal with them without substances and I want my partner to be able to do the same.  
\- **Kids.** I'm not dating single dads. Too much baggage and baby mama drama.  
\- **Heavily overweight or doesn't like being active.** I'm not in the best shape but I'm working on it. And I hate staying indoors for too long. I rather go out to the lake and chill in the sun with a book or painting or go for a long walk.  
\- **Anxiety/depression** without actively trying to work on it and uses it as excuses to not do something or only medicates it thinking that's the end-all-be-all. I think this is mainly my toxic trait for being too much of a type ""here's a problem, these are my options for a solution.""  
\- **Negativity**. I get it. Life is bad but everything has a positive side to it. I have a self-deprecating sense of humour but it's all jokes. You can be negative but you gotta be able to snap out of it yourself because I can't do it for both of us.  
\- **Materialistic/Everything is about money**. I grew up poor and I made my own financial mistakes so I can't tell how to manage your money but I don't wanna hear about it. If all you chase is the next new shiny thing or you see things as easily replaceable, we won't work out because I take care of my stuff for years.  
\- **No hobbies.** Don't even know what we'll talk about if you got nothing going on for yourself. I have way too many myself and I love learning new things so that's something I look for in a partner as well.  
\- **Promiscuous past.** I just don't trust men who have had a lot of partners in the past. Sounds to me more like an inability to be by yourself and do your own thing.  
\- **Too much in my face/Rushing things** and not respecting my boundary to slow things down. Don't get me wrong. I love attention but when I say I'm busy, don't be blowing up my phone.  
\- **Unable to make plans**. If you're even insinuating that you want to go on a date with me without straight up asking, I'm not into it. If I agree, and you're vague about plans or ideas, we're done here too."
dating,12ylsng,2023-04-25 14:55:40,I‚Äôm emotionally cheating in my 5 year relationship,"25 year old female here, who‚Äôs been in a relationship going on 5 years now. Boyfriend and I have lived together 3 years out of the 5. A big reason we live together is financial reasons and we hoped to one day start a family. 

I‚Äôm hitting a point in our relationship where I‚Äôm very bored, barely motivated, or wanting to spend time with my partner. (My last Reddit post explains a lot why) Over the years I‚Äôve always been the one to address doing anything- park dates, dinner dates, concerts, traveling etc. Things COUPLES DO?? I‚Äôve introduced all the experiences we‚Äôve had together, but not vise versa. My bf is 28 and before me, he really hasn‚Äôt experienced life. I blame that on his family and how they were raised because his family really never experienced anything growing up. They didn‚Äôt travel, do activities, don‚Äôt even spend time with extended family, his mother and siblings barely have friends. Just very closed off people who i have very little in common with. I know I can‚Äôt ‚Äúchange‚Äù that about his childhood, but I‚Äôm starting to see those traits now, and I can‚Äôt relate to it at all. 
Bf just wants to work his 9-5 job, come home everyday and blaze up. I‚Äôve always smoked, but not nearly as much as I do now with how often he‚Äôs lights up at home. I can‚Äôt help but smoke along because that‚Äôs our ‚Äúbonding‚Äù at home after we both get off from work. The amount of money he‚Äôs spent on weed has blown me, I know it‚Äôs too much for what he can afford. 

I miss going to the gym, having couple friends, dancing, making funny videos with someone, coming home and hearing ‚Äúbabe get dressed let‚Äôs go try this new restaurant in town.‚Äù I get none of this. Never really have from him. I‚Äôve tried talking to him about it, but he gets mad & shuts down saying sorry he‚Äôs not good enough, and he doesn‚Äôt have the ‚Äúfunds‚Äù for all that right now. Total guilt trip Yet I feel I‚Äôm barely asking for anything! The most frustrating thing is I‚Äôve given him the blueprint of my expectations and what I want in our relationship, they‚Äôre never met. & if I speak on how they‚Äôre not met it turns into days of arguing and it flipping onto me. It‚Äôs just not worth it.

Recently, I‚Äôve been talking to men online, through text, on the phone. Just to distract myself from everything. I used to be such an outgoing person, and now I‚Äôm introverted with barely anyone to talk too. I feel like I have to keep my partner separate from all the things I want to do in life because it‚Äôs just not matching up. I haven‚Äôt gone out and physically cheated, and I don‚Äôt think I ever could. I know it‚Äôs wrong, but it‚Äôs literally keeping me sane having someone uplifting and exciting to talk too. Do I enjoy doing this? No. I wish my own bf could fill these voids. 
Not sure if this is something I need to address to bf before I cut things off, if I do decide to do so. 

Anyone been in a similar situation?",You suck. it happens tho. But you still suck
dating,12q1ir6,2023-04-17 23:29:40,"Women of Reddit, if you were promiscuous in your early 20s and broke the cycle why do you think that was and when?","Had a conversation with a close female friend this weekend and it got me thinking.

She was ‚Äúhorny‚Äù and promiscuous from 22 to her mid 24s and would sleep with one, two or three guys each month and then eventually would date a guy every month or two and immediately bounce to another if not seeing two at once. 

She said when she was mid-24 or so she stopped being so horny and needing of physical attention and sex was still fun but not as needed and calmed down with the boys. 

That got me curious if there‚Äôs a biological correlation to when a young woman is most ‚Äúbaby ready‚Äù and if there are hormones that trigger a young 20s into promiscuity because their body wants to procreate and thus they are more accessible to men.

Just curious what stories or angles others can share. Thanks.",it's really unsettling how focused you guys are on biology and fertility and things of that sort
dating,12d8wwf,2023-04-06 04:24:38,I Feel Like Society Only Accepts Women Sexually Until She Doesn't Put Out,"For refrence, 30F and a virgin by choice. Considered secular according to my community (so, not considered religious). Spiritual. I'd love to save sex for marriage for a multitude of reasons - spiritually, emotionally & physically. I value sex and hold sex as the highest physical intimacy. It's sacred imo and I do not take it lightly. I value my celibacy. I am NOT asexual. I am NOT aromantic. I am so attracted to men physically & emotionally - I find men very, very highly attractive. I would say I am personally not a prude nor timid about sex and love to flirt and show my sexuality towards men. 

This is honestly just me ranting but I am disheartened by society and how it treats women who don't put out sexually. Basically, I feel like society is all like ""you go girl! Sleep with who ever you want, whenever you want! With how many men you want!"" UNTILL a woman is restrictive about her sex life and decides (like me) to ONLY want sex after marriage. Which again I have reasons for. And I am not ashamed about them. They range from very, very practical reasons like Birth Control (for example - I use abstinence as my ""prefered"" BC method) to emotional reasons (I don't want a man to use me sexually and discard me) ect.

Here's my issue - I am so disheartened by feeling so out of place in society because of this, in the sense of for example how I get treated & labeled. Meaning? I am seen as weird. And WHY?? Think about it for a sec! Let's be honest here - All because I literally ""don't let a man IN me""...That's crazy to me! I feel in my soul super conservative about how I'd like to save sex for marriage. I cannot help it tbh. It's in my very nature, I feel like. I don't want to apologize for how I feel. I hate that women like me get treated less than and are very easily compared to objects when men say such disrespectful things like ""why would I buy the car without trying it out first!"" As if we WOMEN are CARS to be TRIED OUT. Disgusting. 

And just to add to this - Initially, I have no problem dating someone who's for example, religious. Someone who is hopefully going to be more respectful about my values because they'd probably be closer to his. The problem is, I'm considered too ""secular"" according to religious communities (in my religion). And, I'm too ""conservative"" (because I don't put out sexually, physically) for secular men. So, I feel like I belong no where in the dating scene, here at least. And, I have no problem dating outside of my religion but here it's pretty rare to find what I think I'd need from such a potential partner (I think it would be much easier in the US). 

All in all, I feel like I don't belong. It's disheartening because I'm NOT weird. I'm literally like any other women libido wise. I have sexual fantasies, desires ect. Many of which aren't even vanilla to begin with lol. I am just more conservative about actually having sex face to face because I think sex has consequinces and I am not willing to freely put myself in that situation with any man other than my Husband. I am sad that that is such a radical thing to feel in society these days. I don't feel like it should be. I only want to give myself physically-sexually to my Husband. It feels like the right choice for me. I think every single women should do what's best for her! As long as she's not hurting others (and others is also including herself). 

I feel like very well meaning ppl have told me in the past that the right man for me is going to respect my values & bounderies and wait for me....and as much as that sounds so incredibly beautiful & romantic (!!) - at this point, I don't know if I'm just being naive or what. Because I can see that even religious ppl (not all but seems like most?? Or at least way more than I thought!) in my community have sex anyways prior to marriage so it's like...even ppl I THOUGHT might respect me and what I need, already don't want a woman such as myself with my sexual bounderies ect. Which don't get me wrong!! They have every right to have those prefrences. I respect it. It's just so disheartening because I was naive about it because I thought they'd want to save sex for marriage as well (meaning they'd let me do so if they were dating me, not that I expect them all to be virgins per se especially at my age). 

I also did a lot of soul searching. Like a good thought experiment. I thought okay, let's say you found the perfect man that respects you and he's religious (from our community & religion)...would that be okay? At first I thought YES. But then I realized, life isn't just about him respecting my decision to have sex only after marriage. Life is about life after marriage. And so, I soon realized that I wouldn't be able to lead such a religious life with said religious Husband. Because we'd differ too much on the religious scale and I would be dishonest and betray myself. So again, this has led me to feel alone in my feelings on this WHOLE initial topic. 

Idk what to do. I don't want to compromise sexually. I don't want to betray myself, my heart, my soul and my bounderies in order to conform to society, sexually. I don't understand why is it so radical to hold such a position in this day and age (saving sex for marriage). Why can't woman like I feel this way? Why can't we choose this for ourselves without being belittled and made to feel less than. 

Thank you for letting me rant üôè
I would really appreciate your thoughts! Do you think there's a solution here? What should I do?..","There's nothing wrong with how you feel about sex--but recognize that you treat it differently than the vast majority of other people, so yeah, you're going to feel a bit isolated.

He kept calling my name and apologizing as I walked away, but I ignored him. When I got home, I saw his messages apologizing, and I told him I'm no longer interested and don't want to pursue this, so I blocked him, and he tried to contact me again. I'm going to block his phone number as well, but having your biggest insecurity confirmed by someone else feels like shit.

dating,11a7exl,2023-02-23 20:11:48,The no ‚Äúclick‚Äù,"I (31/F) dated a guy for 3 dates (35/M) and I thought he was a total catch. He shared a passion for the outdoors with me, we would spend hours talking about books, and had intense sexual chemistry (at least on my side, but pretty sure he felt too because he dropped the words ‚Äúsexy‚Äù multiple times). I wanted to have sex with him, but wanted to go slow because I was 4-6 months out of a toxic relationship that started too fast and I was so afraid of that happening again. So on the third date when we‚Äôre making out on my couch and he‚Äôs asking what I‚Äôm comfortable with, I tell him I want things to progress slowly. Honestly, I wanted to fuck the shit out of him I was just feeling really insecure and coming out of a really stressful time (I started the semester going back to school which was a huge adjustment as a 31 year old), so I played it extra cautious. He  then asked me what I was doing for the week/end and he was going out of town so we both knew it would be at least a week until we‚Äôd see each other next. He told me he would catch up with me when he was back. I texted him once a funny/flirty text to which he responded and laughed and said he‚Äôll catch up when he‚Äôs back. But then the weekend comes and goes and I never hear from him, so I felt like he lost interest in me. I was upset, and I texted him on Monday I felt disappointed our communication dropped off and that it felt a bit like a waiting game for him to reach out (especially when we‚Äôre texting at least once a day before this). I was super nice about it, and told him I really liked him and appreciated those dates, but that I want to spend my time wisely and I should move on. 
He responds that he‚Äôs sorry if his lack of communication bothered me, but that he was feeling reserved and didn‚Äôt feel that ‚Äúclick‚Äù moment he normally looks for, and said we could be friends doing outdoor things, etc. I told him I‚Äôd keep him in mind because I didn‚Äôt want to burn the bridge.  

At first, I was upset because that sounded like his interest dropped off because we didn‚Äôt have sex. There was definitely chemistry/click there in a sense of emotional and intellectual compatibility ‚ÄîI just think I left him sexually frustrated because of my own insecurities. I was very flirty and loved showcasing my seductive side with him so I purposefully built up the sexual tension. 
Now, a few days have passed, and I CANNOT stop thinking about him. Normally when I shut the door on someone, I shut the door and don‚Äôt look back. But with him, it‚Äôs different. I‚Äôm so full of sexual tension I have no idea what to do with myself, I‚Äôm going crazy. I realized I was being too guarded with a guy who seemed genuine and kind (and of course he wants sex, he‚Äôs a guy), and may have teased him without trying to be that way, I was just insecure.
I just can‚Äôt help thinking that the ‚Äúclick‚Äù was the sex that never happened, because I‚Äôd be lying to myself if I said didn‚Äôt want it too. 
I want to give this another chance, and thinking about reaching out to him and asking if he wants to come over for a bottle of wine and let the cards fall. 

What do you all think? Should I just try to move on because he mentioned the no click, or should I put myself out there and what‚Äôs the best way to do it?","Total catch guys always have options. Do you think you're the only woman who thought he was a 'total catch'? That past weekend, he was with a woman who wanted to sleep with him.

Women in the dating scene have multiple men in their contacts at all times because that's all you are to them, an option.

I‚Äôm a man who, in my early twenties, for a while dated a woman in her thirties. It was a positive experience, and I don‚Äôt hear much of any concern that a situation like mine was predatory. 

Can someone help this make sense to me?","A lot of women actually denounce older women who go after much younger men as predators, and the men in the comments will be like ""dude is living the dream""...

It's sad, and a real issue, there are men and boys who are victims of male and female predators and their suffering needs to be heard. 

That said, relationships were both parties are above 21 are rarely judged honestly, whatever the gender  of the older party, at least I think they're not looked at as much as I think they should be. There is that idea that if both people are legally adults then it's all good, and I think it's more complicated than that. Good if your experience was good though"
dating,zeura6,2022-12-07 07:09:37,Question for the ladies,"I recently saw a post elsewhere that had a bunch of agreeing comments and wanted to ask this communities opinion. 

The post in question basically said that a major ick for these women was when a guy followed a bunch of women, mostly Insta-model types, on instagram. 
Now my perspective on this is that it shows a lack of trust on the women‚Äôs part, since to me it is no different from looking at attractive women at the beach or the shops or whatever. I also agree with something my happily married grandmother used to say, ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre not looking, you‚Äôre dead.‚Äù

I am someone who follows a lot of Insta-models and 99.99% of them I know I‚Äôll never meet, and short of dropping a like or the rare comment, will never interact with. I‚Äôm not trying to ‚Äòslide in the dms‚Äô of any of these ladies, and even less so in the rare event I have a partner.

Opinions?","I‚Äôm a guy, but I get it. It would weird me out if a girl was following a bunch of oiled up sexy dudes. 

It just seems really immature and thirsty. You‚Äôre publicly objectifying the other sex. It also makes you look unaware of social boundaries. You‚Äôre literally putting your horniess on display in a public forum. Which leads one to wonder what you‚Äôre looking at in private. 

My insta profile only follows close friends, memes and cute dogs."
dating,z16p8b,2022-11-21 18:48:07,"If you have a girlfriend and she tells you she's not an affectionate person, she is not the one.","This goes out to a lot of men out there who stay in toxic relationships. If your girlfriend tells you she isn't an affectionate person, such as wanting to hold your hand a lot, cuddle with you, or tell you how much she loves you, or rarely shows it at all, she does not truly love you. 

&#x200B;

I have met many women who say that all the time with boyfriends they dated. They tell them they're not very affectionate, and their boyfriend is very needy. Years later, they meet someone new and they instantly click. All of a sudden her views on not being an ""affectionate person"" is all wiped out clean. All of a  sudden she is overly affectionate and desires that man. 

&#x200B;

I have also dated women who weren't affectionate with their previous boyfriends, yet one girl met me, and she said ""I have never felt this way about a man before. I usually am not like this or affectionate at all, but I just can't help myself when I am with you."" And she goes out of her way to see me, or does many things for me, even when you don't want it. But the girl is still crazy over you.

&#x200B;

She just does not feel that way about YOU. And that is fine. Maybe you guys really don't click, and you don't give her that feeling in her heart. It's probably best to not continue the relationship. She eventually will dump you regardless, or she will settle for you, but in her eyes you will never be her number 1 man. You will never be valued at all by her. She will never put you on a pedastal or even her equal, but beneath her. You will be treated to countless arguments, even when you just want the best for your relationship.

Please keep this in mind for future dating and relationships.","As a woman, I kind of agree with this.

I was known as a cactus in my 20 year marriage. I did not feel seen, protected, safe, loved, wanted for who I was.

My current relationship is about 5 months old and I am literally the most touchy feely, affectionate person ever. 

And when I look back to who I was as 16? She's who I am now."

The title makes it sound like a stupid question but please hear me out. 

I‚Äôm a guy who really likes dressing nice, having great hygiene, shopping for cologne, taking care of my skin/hair/nails, and I prefer more creative hobbies rather than sports. 

Literally ANY guy I seem to become friends with either says it‚Äôs weird or I‚Äôm gay. Being gay is not an insult at all, I just find it odd that any form of lack of masculinity makes people think someone is a homosexual.

Thank you in advance. I appreciate you","It sounds like you‚Äôre befriending some really toxic men that have no grasp of reality. They likely are even jealous of how well you take care of yourself and your creative talent. Stay away from such men.

Being well groomed and creative is a massive turn on for all healthy minded women. Personal hygiene is a must and being well groomed is objectively attractive in all human beings. As a woman myself I personally don‚Äôt even care whether a guy is interested in sports or creative arts, what I really care about is how he is as a person, how well he treats me, and how well he treats others."

dating,wsahti,2022-08-19 10:28:21,Dehumanizing people based on their height needs to stop,"""Hey, you're face is too messed up for me to date you""

""Hey, you're nose is way too big""

""You're eyes are just too far apart. That's not my preference.""

Although you have preferences about someone's face, nose, and eyes, you probably wouldn't say those things to a potential dating prospect. Culturally, we have mostly outgrown saying those things because we recognize that behavior to be very dehumanizing. Not to mention the fact that those qualities cannot be changed without surgery.

But its not just the verbalization of those above quotes that we have outgrown. It's the acknowledgement that we shouldn't reduce people's value to the way their face is arranged, their nose length, or the distance between their eyes. 

So, why is it still socially acceptable to reduce a man to his height by calling him tooo short (implying that none of his other qualities matter)? Or, in rarer cases, calling a woman tooo tall?

You might as well just tell them that their bone structure and genetics is not good enough for you.

And by the way, I'm not demanding that women be attracted to sho..rt men, nor that they pretend to be attracted to them. Same goes for men regarding women (usually because they are tooo tall). Physical attraction is typically non-negotatiable.

 All I'm saying is that, in the same way we have outgrown reducing people to many of the qualities that they can't change, we should strive to do the same in regards to height. 

Anyone who has ever had a relationship will tell you - Attraction is built over the time of getting to know someone. Even people you were intiially unattracted to/unsure about. And sometimes, those can be the best relationships you've ever had.","I think a key point in that debate is that preferences are not innate. You're not born with them, they come from somewhere. 

Having a preference for a certain height typically comes from being exposed to a ton of media that portrays the man as being much taller than the woman, and this form of dominance by the height being crucial to romantic scenes. Some women internalize this, and it's understandable, and end up being only attracted to tall men. But the origin of that needs to be questioned. 

Also, it's not a preference if it's an absolute rule. Like if you prefer chocolate, that doesn't mean you reject everything else and only ever have chocolate. The term preference is pretty insidious because it's kinda of a cope out."
dating,wcpyj3,2022-07-31 14:25:43,What‚Äôs wrong with a guy asking a girl on a date?,"Sorry, this question is just sparked from a couple of videos I‚Äôve seen lately. I‚Äôve just seen women being incredibly rude to men who, at least in these circumstances, seem to just be interested is setting up a date.

For one example, I just recently saw one instance where this woman was working out and this man politely waited until she was done with her current exercise to ask for her number. And without missing a beat she just said, ‚Äúoh no, I‚Äôm sorry, I‚Äôm too young for you.‚Äù

Or another where this woman was screaming at this man for even approaching her while waiting for seats at a restaurant.

What‚Äôs worse is following all these videos is something passive aggressively written like ‚Äúcan‚Äôt believe he would even ask me, made sure he won‚Äôt again üôÇ‚Äù

I understand when women go out, not everyone is looking for a date or a romance. And I‚Äôm sure if you are asked enough, it can get annoying. Or depending on bad experiences it can even trigger bad memories or panic. But, at least in these videos, that doesn‚Äôt seem to be the case. But everyone in the comments of these are like ‚Äúyeah u go girl‚Äù

I guess I feel like it‚Äôs best to politely turn down someone‚Äôs advances, and if they don‚Äôt get the message then you can get nasty. But by automatically being terrible, you may create a terrible experience for that person asking you out. And that may lead them to be someone another person would have to get nasty with in the future.

I just don‚Äôt get it really. Can someone tell me why some women feel the need to do this?",It sounds like people are opening the convo with women they DONT EVEN KNOW by asking for a number. And the other one is definitely because the guy was too old. Don't know why you asked about that one it was right in your description

dating,uzqpzc,2022-05-28 16:22:20,THIS is why FASHION will help you get girls," Fashion is one of the things that i think can improve your dating by 1,000 if you're not optimizing it.

The reason why I say that is because I am someone who didn‚Äôt optimize fashion at all growing up. I grew up with a single mom who worked 3 jobs and I had no time to even think about that kind of stuff.

As the years have gone by my friends and girls I‚Äôve dated have slowly helped improve my fashion, and one little thing can make a huge difference.

You get a better first reaction which boosts your confidence which makes for a better interaction.

And guys I have no passion for fashion, I‚Äôm literally the kind of guy who would dress in mis-matching clothes, multiple different brands and so on, but when your starting out and approaching, having that good first impression will make a world of difference.

Personally I have around 5 to 10 outfits that I cycle through, I don‚Äôt have a huge wardrobe I just wear the same stuff Bc I know it works.

One tip that has helped me is organizing my clothes into out fits.

This way, when I go to my closet I don‚Äôt have to think, hmm do these match, I just have a minimalist approach, have 5-10 outfits and rotate them

And a lot of my clothes are just all black.

It‚Äôs not something I have to think about and it‚Äôs easy to throw on.

You‚Äôd be surprised how much a girl will respond to you when your just wearing an all black fit, no logos or nothing. 

What‚Äôs more important is the vibe, your mood, how present are you, how congruent are you, what‚Äôs your emotional state like and what mood she‚Äôs in than what your wearing, but if your walking up dressed poorly, or your shirt is all wrinkled your losing an opportunity to have a good first reaction.

So looking up some simple fashion videos will make a world of difference. That‚Äôs something that I‚Äôve been doing recently and It‚Äôs definitely a confidence boost when you go out.

Alright so linked below I left one of my favorite guys for fashion but honestly there‚Äôs a million people you can pick from.

Also if your interested in coaching, and you want to improve your dating fast, I‚Äôm going to be taking in a select few so shoot me a DM and I promise you won‚Äôt regret it.","Everyone is different though. My ex and I wore a hoodie to our dates with logos and I thought he looked really cute. Someone who dresses too plain, isn't my type usually because I love the comfy idc looks or the alt looks"

I‚Äôve now been using them for almost two years and have had no luck whatsoever. I‚Äôm out here competing against girls who look like literal models and influencers, and even the absolute best pics of me (which don‚Äôt even represent how I really look) and well thought out prompts, aren‚Äôt enough. Even when I do get matches, I‚Äôm terrified to ever meet up with them because I know they almost definitely won‚Äôt be attracted to me in real life. The one time I did go on a date from Bumble, that‚Äôs exactly what happened and it crushed my self-esteem even more. Several guys have also messaged me insulting my appearance.

But the truth is, I don‚Äôt even blame these guys. Why would they bother going out with average or below average looking girls, when they have access to a plethora of girls who are absolutely stunning? Moreover, I‚Äôm also a brown woman, and it‚Äôs no secret that most men (of all races) have a preference for white or East Asian women, which in turn makes things even more difficult for me.

Well, things have changed a little bit. I know now that isn't the way to play the game. So after the date I labeled her name as ""Don't Do It"" in my phone. That way whenever I felt a little insecure and wanted that validation that makes me so high on life. I would remember. Now is not the time to show your cards.

For real, it SUCKED, I wanted to remind her that I am around. But whenever I thought of texting her I saw the message. ""Don't Do It"" It worked, it made me realize that she isn't the only one out there. I went to work, earned my money and didn''t succumb to that pathetic text asking ""How did your day go?""

My friends. My brothers. You are worth more, just like everyone says. You gotta believe in yourself. It doesn't really matter if she texts you or not. It is more about who you think you are. So my advice is, that when you feel you aren't nothing but a bucket of shit just give yourself a little extra credit. You are what you are and as long as you're ok with that; the rest is just getting others to follow suit. Now, get out there, find someone you like and believe in yourself. Best of luck! Wish me luck!

There are too many cultural and social differences that, in the long run, are too much work to explain. Does anyone else feel this way? 

Taking into account my experiences I‚Äôve had as black woman and a first

Physical traits are a common preference too. Skin color can certainly be one, but also body type, height, weight, facial structure, etc. determines whether or not we find someone attractive. Some women like tall men. Some men like thick women.

He was good company, I liked waking up to his voice and falling asleep to a long conversation with him. 
I‚Äôm not sure what happened this time. He called me on a Thursday.. I missed his call and called him back in the morning, but he didn‚Äôt pick up. I called him again over the weekend, no response. Silence. I called him again during the week.. silence. So I texted him and said - why are you ignoring me? And he replied to this saying - what is your problem? I was out doing stuff. I said ok and left it. I called once more.. no response. I sent him a nasty text after this and said ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt want to talk anymore, just say it- ignoring is so immature. Bye‚Äù and I unfollowed him from my socials. He replied saying yeah yeah bye, and now we‚Äôve both blocked each other.

""I don't drink coffee."" sounds like a hard no, slightly rude response

What would be a nice response if I want to say yes?

Edit: I don't drink tea, I love sugar and I like frappes, but I'm afraid not all coffee shops are like Starbucks

Edit 2: Yes I know grabbing a coffee *is about the company of each other, not about drinking coffee* itself, I ask because I didn't want to order nothing at a coffee shop that doesn't have a large menu, I feel like that would be a little weird that they'll enjoy their coffee while I have nothing and stare into their soul.

For me, I feel like if I asked someone to go out for some food with me, I'd like for us to enjoy something together. I wouldn't want to invite a friend to McDonalds if they don't like it and just sit there and watch me eat.",Just say yes and order something different than coffee. Tea? Coco? Chai?

dating,pzmge5,2021-10-02 02:18:35,Do you think there should be a section for penis size on apps?,"I think that size is a subject of extreme anxiety for guys, especially before having sex for the first time. However, I think that anxiety comes from the fact that there's really no knowing how a person will react, and that frankly, most guys don't fault that reaction which leads to not even perusing anyone out of fear.

Like many other things, I feel like it would ease that anxiety if men on dating apps knew that from very start, women talking to them are fine with it. Like other sections, there would also be the ability to simply put ""rather not say"" or ""ask me"" etc, which is very common.

Do you think this would make things better or worse, and what's your reasoning?","Ew no. I don't want to see that. I don't want to know that. And i assume that everyone would lie anyway and say they're bigger than they are.

Penis size is not at all as important as guys think. It's truly not. I think it's mainly just y'all trying to one up each other."
dating,psjrqo,2021-09-21 14:24:21,Why are so many people comfortable with cheating on their partners,"
To put it out there I know everyone cheats. Men and women both, everyone is capable of it. My rant is aimed more towards men because of a particular story that I had heard from my ex. 

My ex boyfriend used to be married, he told me a lot about his ex and the things that went down with them. He told me that he cheated on her at one point in their relationship. So me being the naturally curious person that I am I wanted to know how it happened, the chain of events that led him to cheat on her and he told me

He said he met this girl as the store that he was working at, he said she was incredibly beautiful and had taken to him. So after seeing her a couple times they eventually exchanged numbers. After talking for a little bit they agreed to meet up and after a few times hanging out they eventually had sex a couple times. They way he described it, how fluent all of this happened it honestly blew my mind. He was obviously attracted to her, he knew what he could possibly get from her and he got it. He went out of his way for this girl, did things that I can‚Äôt even wrap my head around like going to a bar and staying up for 24 hours to be around her. 

What‚Äôs even more baffling was that his friends were cheering him on. They encouraged him to have sec with this girl. He even told me that one of his friends at the time was constantly cheating on his wife and was cheating on his wife around the same time he meet this girl. But all his friends were telling him he should do it. His ex wasn‚Äôt the best person but I don‚Äôt think anyone should get cheated on. 

It‚Äôs just the principle of it all, it was too easy, it‚Äôs like for some guys this isn‚Äôt their own subculture. It‚Äôs honestly gross and I can never look at him the same after that. His reasoning for cheating was because him and his wife at the time were living in separate states and she wasn‚Äôt giving anything to him. I somewhat understand your needs not being met by your partner but I don‚Äôt understand cheating, I can‚Äôt grasp surrounding yourself with people who are okay with your actions and even partake themselves. 

I was disgusted, still am, hearing this. The excitement in his voice, he was proud of what he had done. He told the story in great detail, even thought it had been a couple years since this happened. I‚Äôve lost all hope in long term relationship and marriage. I‚Äôve lost all faith, knowing something like this could happen in the shadows and you wouldn‚Äôt even know it. This story haunts me, I‚Äôve lost all faith in relationships. 

TL;DR EX BOYFRIEND TELLS ME A STORY OF WHEN HE CHEATS ON HIS WIFE AND HOW EASY IT WAS TO DO","People who cheat, cheat a lot. This makes it seem like a lot of people cheat, but its really a minority of serial cheaters racking up overtime. This principle also applies to many things besides cheating."
dating,pm0tqx,2021-09-11 04:41:21,Girlfriend draws up 17-page contract for Tinder flame after dating two weeks. Isn't this legalized prostitution?,"New York post article:

""Within the 17-page document, Wright outlined all of her expectations for their relationship, which asked Head for no silent treatment, TO PAY FOR DATE NIGHTS and to not isolate her from her loved ones.""

Wouldn't this be prostitution or a form of it at least? If he is always paying for dates and they are having sex, isn't he just paying her for sex and companionship by buying her dinner and gifts? She NEVER pays. It's right there in the contract. I mean, he's a sap for signing it but isn't this just legalized prostitution?

I thought dating was supposed to be about 2 people getting to know each other that have MUTUAL interest. This seems like she is just looking for a free ride and wanted to make it legal so once he realizes it, he can't get out of it.

If this isn't legalized prostitution, what is it because it sure seems one sided to me and the guy is taking all the risk. Why can't she pay her half or pay every other time? Isn't that fair? Doesn't that show that she is invested in him too? What am I missing here?","Did my boyfriend engage in prostitution because I bought him lunch yesterday and we had sex at some point? No. This is a weird take. Her contract is super cringe. Is it prostitution? No. She isn't specifically exchanging sex for money. She's looking for a sugar daddy and there's nothing illegal about that, just sad."
dating,pih7mh,2021-09-05 17:22:26,"Is wanting to date a woman with a healthy body composition an ""unrealistic standard"" for a normal man?","According to medical publications, a man with higher than 17% body fat and a woman with higher than 32% body fat are both classified as ""overfat"" which is a condition of high enough body fat to no longer be healthy. I think health and fitness are important. I work out every day (biking, swimming, weights, or body weight) for 30-40 minutes. I practice intermittent fasting and try to eat mostly healthy foods. My body fat is around 14% and going down slowly over time.

I would like to date someone similar to me who also maintains a healthy body composition. I asked about this yesterday, and the answers I got all essentially (and angrily) said that it is unrealistic for a normal man to expect to date someone similar to him in this regard.

The answers said that a woman with a healthy body composition has so many options she will demand the man be tall, or white, or beautiful, or look like he's on steroids. I am none of those things.

Thus I was told I should not expect to date anyone similar to me. Parallel to that, someone in another thread suggested I also increase my exercise to 10 hours per week (1-2 hours per day) as I'm not getting exactly the endurance and strength I want from my current routine. I'm considering it but I also fear that this will just disconnect me from the women I am able to date further.

If I am working out 10 hours a week, I am concerned the prospect of meeting someone compatible likely goes down not up. Although my fitness might improve somewhat, since I'm still not going to be using steroids, I likely won't reach the movie star physique threshold. Thus I won't get the benefit of standing out against the steroid users on apps. At the same time, my lifestyle will become even more abnormal compared to the average sedentary person.

What do you think? Is wanting to date a woman who similarly maintains a healthy body composition with a lifestyle like mine an unrealistic lifestyle standard? Do you think going up to 10 hours of exercise per week might make it better or worse?","I don‚Äôt know about the exercise thing but there‚Äôs nothing wrong with wanting to date a woman who also maintains a healthy life style, i, myself, am not attracted to men who are sedentary and don‚Äôt take care of their body and that‚Äôs just a personal preference."
dating,oxerhk,2021-08-03 22:37:16,Men‚Äôs advice. Understanding and following basic attraction rules doesn‚Äôt make you manipulative. Not putting a woman at the center of your universe doesn‚Äôt make you a jerk,"To be clear, there is a lot of manipulative behavior that is promoted when it comes to attraction. It typically involves exploiting insecurity and using subtle tactics to degrade.

However, often times this type of behavior is conflated with being successful with women in general. There‚Äôs a perception that success with women is in inherently tied to deception and narcissism.

If a man understands that he should text with restraint, mirror behavior, be playful and tease while still being respectful, utilize subtle touch to escalate emotion, dating as much as many people as possible until a relationship is established, this doesn‚Äôt make him manipulative because he understands the true nature of attraction.

Some guys are labeled ‚Äòjerks‚Äô, when in reality they simply aren‚Äôt Nice Guys, and neglect all other important components of their lives for a woman. They have integrity and are upfront with their feelings, but are still seen as jerks because they have boundaries and aren‚Äôt pushovers. Yes, a lot of assholes are successful with women, because their behavior is often confused with with assertiveness and masculinity. However, a centered, respectful man can still be assertive and strong.

There‚Äôs a contradictory expectation of men nowadays. Women revile and reject the Nice Guy, but it is also expected to be our default setting as well. When a man deviates from what society tells us is the proper way to win a woman over, i.e. through unwavering devotion despite any behavior she may throw at him, he is traditionally labeled as a jerk.

Remember, a good majority of behavior that is attractive to women runs counter to what society has conditioned men to believe through Hollywood and other forms of media. If you have authentic respect for someone and who they are, and don‚Äôt engage in behavior for the sole purpose of getting a specific reaction, you aren‚Äôt being a jerk. Especially if you have acted like a Nice Guy all your life, not immediately responding to a text or disagreeing upfront might feel uncomfortable, but it is how attraction really works in real life.",">Women revile and reject the Nice Guy, but it is also expected to be our default setting as well.

Oh so you just don't get it. Allow me to mansplain.

See if you're nice, cordial, plan the date, pay for dinner, AND (this is important) EXPECT second date, sex, or anything else BECAUSE you did nice things, you're in the wrong.

You can be nice and not demand things, not feel entitled to things. If you are doing these things and feel you're being taken advantage of, find someone else who values your behavior.

>Especially if you have acted like a Nice Guy all your life, not immediately responding to a text or disagreeing upfront might feel uncomfortable, but it is how attraction really works in real life.

It sounds like you have anxiety issues if you feel you pressured to reply instantly and can't disagree. How do you expect to find a meaningful relationship if from the get go you lie about your thoughts."
dating,os9qny,2021-07-26 22:27:09,Why are short women and tall men so picky in the dating scene?," 

Both groups of short women and tall men have the weirdest height preferences even from what i've seen. Short women usually below like 5'4 sometimes have a minimum height requirement of at least like 5'10, in a lot of cases even minimum 6 feet. If a guy is taller than them but they aren't ""average or above"" they are ""too short."" Reverse this with tall men. I've seen tall men say that women that are 5'6 and up are ""too tall"" because they are not ""short"" and they only like ""short"" women so they only like a certain range that is ""short"" to them even though a 5'8 woman is 8 inches shorter than a 6'4 man she is not ""short"" because she is considered a tall woman.

I've even seen tall guys literally state that they only like women under 5'4 and they actively reject women that are 5'4+ because they are literally not short by the countries standards. Oftentimes both requirements of these groups meet and then they usually gloat how much better they are than other groups respectively. Other people like short guys, average girls, tall girls and average guys aren't usually that strict about height, its usually the short women and tall guys tbh.",What's wrong with short women preferring taller guys?

3. Don‚Äôt be boring. You don‚Äôt have to have the best personality. If you are good looking you don‚Äôt have to be that funny. Women will laugh at your not so funny jokes just because they are physically attracted to you and don‚Äôt want to lose your attention. 

4. Do nice things but keep it at a minimum. Do it enough to keep their interest. If you do it too often they will view you as weak. Don‚Äôt be a pushover.

But no one would do that. Because we all think we have some kind of value that demands something better than that. In other words, we respect ourselves to a certain degree. We don‚Äôt think we are worthless. So we refuse to treat ourselves like we are worthless.

So feeling entitled is actually **healthy**!! That‚Äôs literally what self esteem is. What‚Äôs bad is when there is a discrepancy.

After posting a Instagram photo I shoot my shot and complimented her beauty through the DM and asked her for basic contact information to get to know her better.

The results shocked her and thinks this whole conversation we had was all a dream, she would say things like ‚Äúomg I can‚Äôt believe this, it‚Äôs so hard to decide because I know your mother and you‚Äôre so young‚Äù then I told her on my end I promise all this will be our little secret because I don‚Äôt kiss and tell. Now we have regular conversations asking about upcoming plans and dates we‚Äôre doing soon so she agreed for this upcoming Saturday at a Italian restaurant.

I‚Äôm excited for this date because I know how to be a gentleman so easy, I‚Äôm a social butterfly I know how to make good times happen and I‚Äôm gonna get her small gifts like a rose when I pick her up for our date then take her for a walk around town.

Wish me luck I hope things go well.","I‚Äôm going to be completely honest with you here and please don‚Äôt take any of this the wrong way. First off, congrats on setting a date with someone it sounds like you‚Äôre very attracted to! But remember to just chill and be yourself. I‚Äôm 34 and would already be very apprehensive about dating someone in their early 20‚Äôs, and then I‚Äôd be inwardly cringing if they gave me ‚Äúsmall gifts‚Äù including a rose on our first date. 

Every person is different, and maybe you know this woman and she would be into that, but it is almost always the best course of action to treat this first meeting as a low pressure way for you *both* to become more familiar and decide if you actually like them as a person. 

A young guy tripping all over himself to impress me and giving me a rose on the first date would feel really strange and immature to me and people in their 30‚Äôs are generally looking for an equal partner.

But I actually quite enjoy them, and this is coming from a male. For one, I get to meet different people ... which normally wouldn't be the case as I hang out with the same friend group. Even if it's only one or two dates with a week of texting, sometimes it's fun just to dive into someone else's life for a couple weeks. I get ghosted, unmatched, etc like everyone but it just means they weren't interested so who cares? On top of that, in what other world can you just browse potential matches from the comfort of your toilet?!

I dont know. I haven't found that person that makes me stay up at night, but I've had a lot of fun with people that I know I would have never met otherwise. I feel like OLD gives me options to find a more suitable match rather than trying to work something out with a person I meet through friends or the bar or w/e. Most of the apps I can tell what theyre into, their religious/political views, wether they have kids, etc before even deciding if I want to swipe on them.

Personally I think the benefits of OLD outweigh the negatives ... and I guess I'm the only one on that sinking ship hahaha.","You love them because you're some combo of tall/white/handsome.

dating,lpcyfd,2021-02-22 02:31:09,People who post about politics on their dating profiles are usually crazy.,"I‚Äôm not referring to political affiliation: liberal or political affiliation: moderate or whatever it may be. 

I‚Äôm talking about people who need to frequently post about equality or I‚Äôm a career oriented woman..if you can‚Äôt handle me, swipe left. 

In today‚Äôs world, most women are career women. Rent costs $2k a month for a 600 sq foot apartment where I live...how the fuck can you survive if you‚Äôre not career oriented. The average single family home where I live is $1.6 million. Childcare costs $2k a month where I live. If you don‚Äôt bring money to the table, it‚Äôs a struggle to survive and raise a family in today‚Äôs world. Being a housewife today isn‚Äôt practical in most coastal cities in America where the jobs tend to be. The fact that someone needs to have their dating profile consist of I‚Äôm a career woman and if you can‚Äôt handle me, swipe left rather than other parts of himself or himself already raises red flags..to me, a person posting this kind of stuff on their dating profile is stubborn and selfish. 

As for equality, obviously this along with racism are systemic issues but bringing this up in your dating profile? Maybe if this is your job or if you spend a lot of time helping women or oppressed people, then posting about equality is great...but otherwise...you come off as an arrogant complainer. Unfortunately most people who feel the need to talk about equality are in the latter. 

Edit: I myself am liberal. I have voted for Obama twice, Hilary, and Joe Biden. I am also a registered Democrat. A lot of what republicans have been doing is pretty corrupt and awful but I don‚Äôt think your dating profile is the place to talk about that given the space constraints.","Has it not occurred to you that they may be doing that because of their past experiences with men? Some men still struggle with their masculinity if their partner out-earns them, some men still expect women to give up their careers when it's time to have kids, some men still believe women are not equal to them. If you live in a liberal city, you'd think these types of men are rare but there are so many of them that exist outside of your liberal city and it's likely these women felt the need to put a disclaimer in their profiles to filter out such men."

Listen, I'm all for feminism, but to me the sub seems like a ""woke, yasqueen, menarebad"" type of feminism.","Yeah I lasted a day in that sub before I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. It‚Äôs more harmful than helpful imo.

dating,l5rjcu,2021-01-27 00:09:30,When a woman says that she prefers chubby guys I can‚Äôt help but to think that they are full of shit,I believe they are settling and hoping someone better looking comes along and if that were to happen they wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to leave their current partner and I don‚Äôt blame them. I would do the same if the shoe was on the other foot. If I met someone and I liked her personality as much as I liked my current partners and she was way better looking than my partner I would leave that relationship. Chubby people like myself are placeholders at best.,"Its just another one of those feel good talking points people spout to try to make people feel better. Im 35 and honest to God, ive never met a woman that genuinely prefers bigger guys. Ive met several that SAID they did, but then all they ever date are little scrawny guys. This is a falsehood perpetuated to make chubby guys feel better about themselves."
dating,kz2og9,2021-01-17 08:24:11,"For women, find the guy who is ok with your past and mention it early so you dont waste your time.","Its always the same thing. Most women are lied to or are naive enough to think their ""wild phase"" wont matter or shouldnt matter. But the reality is that it matters. To almost ALL MEN. No man wants to wife the girl who has banged the whole neighbourhood.

Most men dont get to bang as many women as they want but women do. Its a LOT LOT easier for women to get laid and I dont think most women get this. If most men arent banging girls, then who is? Its always the ""hot guys"" or the ""rich guys"" that bang women on their 1st date and move on to another because women let them bang. Now imagine it from the man's perspective. He meets one of this guy who you banged on your first date with minimum effort from his side. Say he is his co-worker. How would he feel? He is with a girl that he shows so much care and affection for and worked so hard to win her over, who was banged and disposed of by this guy. He didnt have to put in effort to get your girls attention and love and here you are trying your best. You feel like a sucker.

Finally, it not about the sex. Its about your virtue and morale and how you are as a person. Almost all guys wont have a problem if you have slept 1000 times with your ex- long term bf who loved you or your ex-husband who died but will have a problem if you had sex just 10 times with 10 different men. That just means you are easy and not valuable enough and to spend such time and dedication to win your love makes him a sucker. And the only reason men say they are ok with your previous partner is because they know , nowadays they cant find a women without it. They dont like it but they dont like the alternative of being alone either. Between a high number woman and a low number woman, almost all men will always choose the low number woman. Obviously, personality and other factors also play a role in a relationship but if he could find the same version of you with less number, he will choose the less number.

Also, I find it ironic how most women here dont like being judged on their past but judges the guy for wanting a girl who hasnt slept around. At the end of the day, its your only life and you should live how you want. But its also important to understand the possible consequences for your actions. Its important to see the world for what it is then what it should be like, according to you.","I do, and I will judge a woman on her past. I don't have any hate in my heart it's a simple logical decision.

From my observation the girls with a high body count are more likely to cheat. From seeing my friends when they date girls who have been around they end up being cheated on, or the relationship doesn't work out. My friends who have virgin or close to virgin girlfriends have a more successful relationship, the girl tends to be more loyal, respectful and generally has better behaviour.

Choosing my life partner is the most important decision of my life, I'm going to be very judgemental and ruthless in my decision making to protect myself from ending up like the majority of men. Divorced, cheated on, and has a shit life because of the low quality woman they married"

dating,kkpq5n,2020-12-26 20:53:30,I'm a 26yo Male and I no longer see any point in dating,"  Heres why:  
 

1. Sex is just not worth the time or effort it takes to get it 

It seems like this is the driving force behind most of the interactions I have with women. Most of those interactions are pulling teeth just to get them to engage meaningfully in the conversation. They always complain ""guys only want one thing"" - The reason for that is most women don't have much going on upstairs anyway, and the ones that do are usually to introverted to open up because they're afraid of 'being too smart' or whatever. 

The only thing worse than a woman playing 'hard to get' is the ones that throw pussy at you - which honestly just makes me feel like they might have AIDS or serious daddy issues, so its just a huge turn off when things move too fast. Finding a woman that is well adjusted, with a healthy sexual appetite, and limited baggage, that isn‚Äôt already taken is impossible. You have to bite the bullet somewhere and her flaws only become more apparent as things progress. 

Sex doesn't make up for the minefield you have to tiptoe through to get a mediocre blowjob and some starfish action. It just seems like most women have the attitude that 'you should feel lucky to get anything at all'. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just a lack of attraction to me but judging by the loads of women who report having very few or no orgasms at all - It seems they have little interest in sex and just use it as a bargaining chip for resources and attention. I always end up feeling like I‚Äôm begging for a treat from someone I‚Äôm not the least bit interested in as a person - but I‚Äôm left with virtually no other options. 

2. My efforts rarely feel appreciated

There seems to be an unequal amount of effort being put forth - just seems like no matter how things are going she always has other, maybe even better options, and she just keeps me around because Im available - but at the end of the day, if things go sideways there‚Äôs ten other dudes ready to take my place in an instant. 

""I could have another You in a minute, As a matter of fact he‚Äôll be here in a minute‚Äù - Beyonce 

I‚Äôm completely disposable ‚Äì nothing I do will ever amount to anything more than momentary pleasure for her, and the entire dynamic is set up to serve her needs over mine. Everything from paying for dates, to buying gifts, to paying her compliments, to listening to her problems, and waiting on her hand and foot is all about keeping her happy at my expense or else. It would be ok if it were 50/50 but it just never is, and if you make too much fuss about wanting equal treatment ‚Äì they just default to ‚Äòyou‚Äôre the man, that‚Äôs your job‚Äô or ‚Äòif I‚Äôm not good enough for you then leave‚Äô at which point you are replaced. Its never that quick and easy for the guy ‚Äì no matter how successful he is, and even then, you just end up with another woman that expects the world in exchange for what ever she decides to give him no matter how small. The man seems to be expected to ‚Äòfeel lucky‚Äô just to be with anybody at all, were as the woman needs to have all her needs met at all times or else the guy is a selfish piece of shit, that doesn‚Äôt know how to please a woman and will likely be replaced soon. God help you if you marry her and have kids and get dragged through family court to have your wealth stripped from you under threat of imprisonment. Its just a raw deal as far as I can see.

3. Relationships are more maintenance than fun

Even if you manage to maintain a stable relationship ‚Äì it‚Äôs a grind from day to day just to keep the plates spinning, and the situation usually blows up in your face anyway. After all the communicating, and bonding, and planning you do as a couple ‚Äì you‚Äôre always a few bad days away from a breakup. You can try to hang in there an ‚Äòmake things work‚Äô, but its never going to be as easy as just not starting one in the first place. Once the initial sexual attraction wares off I just find myself sitting next to someone I don‚Äôt really have anything in common with but am committed to and obligated to keep. Maybe some superficial things like our shared taste in media or politics ‚Äì maybe we have a similar out look on life or a similar lifestyle, but they‚Äôre their own person, with their own thoughts and motivations. Its only a matter of time until you conflict on something major and it takes a toll on your own happiness. When stuff like this happens, I just feel like I need time apart to think about our future together and how to follow through on it. But then they get super needy and clingy like im about to break up with them, which just drives me away even more. It always comes down to a ‚Äòits me or your own happiness‚Äô kind of vibe ‚Äì so I just bail and end up feeling a weight off my shoulders when its all over. 

Why bother carrying a boulder uphill against the wind just to have it whine that youre not working hard or fast enough to get to the top of the hill?? Much easier to just drop the boulder. Maybe I just don‚Äôt feel the need for companionship enough to suffer through all the drama? Its so nice to wake up in the morning knowing I can do as I please, when I please, and for my own sake and happiness without feeling guilty for prioritizing myself over a partner the way women often do.

4. Having children seems borderline immoral and selfish

How many kids grow up in broken homes, raised by stupid parents, that have no idea what they‚Äôre doing? They give their children a series of hang ups and mental illnesses that they inherited from their awful parents, as they try to either live through them vicariously or just completely drop the ball raising them and outsource their responsibilities to other people. Children are mostly raised by the public school system and the media ‚Äì parents are either overworked trying to provide for them, or just fucked up and accidently got pregnant and had them with no plan or purpose as to how they will live their lives. The world is full of toxic adults that all started out as neglected children. No thanks ‚Äì I don‚Äôt want that responsibility and pretending like im just magically going to be a way better parent than all the other idiot parents is naive. Plus, I don‚Äôt want to lose half my paycheck in child support once my spouse starts prioritizing the kids over our relationship and looks for a more affluent provider.

5. Online dating is just exacerbating all these issues

Seriously ‚Äì that shit is insane how its totally set up to advantage women. I don‚Äôt need to go into detail about the ghosting, using people for free food, sugar babies, and just straight up insane behavior and expectations put on men in these arenas. There are thousands of articles on this shit and it‚Äôs all true. Ive used Tinder, Bumble, Badoo, Pof, Hinge, Blk people meet, Scout, Clover, etc, and theyre all terrible.

Im about to buy a sexdoll and call it a life tbh ‚Äì I look forward to getting a dog and enjoying being single until the death of me. Ive been a man whore, Ive been married, Ive committed, and cheated, And the whole experience of dating, sex, and relationships has left me feeling completely disinterested in continuing. Im just over it‚Ä¶. What do you think?","> the reason for that is most women don‚Äôt have much going on upstairs

So, I thought he understood that. 

I recently got a text from him saying he was at a party and got a girl‚Äôs number. I don‚Äôt know if she offered first or he asked her, but it doesn‚Äôt matter too much to me. I got angry because the conversation that followed between us implied that he was romantically interested in her. The thing is, he wasn‚Äôt telling me this to break things off so he could date her. He just wanted to inform me that he did this, but wanted to continue seeing me and was shocked at my reaction. I have no idea what response he wanted or expected of me. 

Since this obviously showed that I wasn‚Äôt treated or seen as exclusive with him, I basically told him to screw off and just go date the new girl. I‚Äôm not interested in partaking in some ‚Äúcompetition‚Äù where this guy potentially flits around between girls to see which one he likes best, then to ditch the others. I told him I‚Äôm not okay with that, and felt as though the fact he stayed for a few months meant he had the same opinion. 

Breaking things off made him lose his mind. In text form he started pleading for me to reconsider, and kept asking why was this a dealbreaker/making me upset because in his words ‚Äúit was just getting her number I didn‚Äôt even go on a date with her yet.‚Äù Uh not literally yet, but it implied he was interested in getting to know her romantically, what a dipsh*t.

I left my phone alone hoping he‚Äôd run out of steam but he then started blowing my phone up with calls, with texts asking me to ‚Äújust talk to him‚Äù in between. That‚Äôs when I finally blocked him. This just turned out unnecessarily crazy, I wonder what was going through his mind the whole time.",">while we aren‚Äôt in a relationship

Wait, you guys were never in a relationship?... What's the issue?... Did you ever tell him that you liked him?

Did you started getting romantically interested in him and expected him to just ""figure things out"" and you guys are not a couple?

>I recently got a text from him saying he was at a party and got a girl‚Äôs number.

I can agree that this is weird, but I think his main goal was to make you jealous into you asking him out, because he doesn't know how too. But if you like him, you should have told him. Guys (especially younger guys) are not relationship experts, a majority of them don't know how to tell a girl that they like them because of fear of rejection. Yeah you flirt with him and send him hints, but that's not enough for him to make the move"

Let's talk,"Have y'all had this strange experience with online dating where you really think you find someone attractive and then something makes you sharply realize you're not attracted to them or to each other? Even though literally everything else was fine and dandy there is just that one thing you can't overlook and it ruins it all? And it happens over and over and over again? What are your stories and what do you think causes this specifically in online dating?

For context, I (25,F) matched with a guy 2 weeks ago. Loved all his pictures, found him attractive etc. Our date comes up  and although  he makes me laugh a lot (which I like), takes care of the bill , appreciates my time, compliments me and appreciates my humor, we have an amazingly deep intellectual conversation, has a great career etc, I cannot get over the fact that he is not my physical type in terms of height. Turns out his online photos make him look taller. He's interested and wants to hang out again but I don't want to have the conversation of letting him down only for him to ask me why.

TL/DR: interested to hear your experiences about a single issue that ruined a connection with someone you otherwise found amazing?","so glad to see someone with their priorities straight. i mean, what does intelligence, generosity, personality, kindness, sense of humor, and financial stability matter if he's not tall? you look at all the good, happy, healthy relationships and you see, clearly, that it all stems from the fact that the man is tall.

dating,bibrkp,2019-04-28 14:27:31,What's wrong with Canadian women?,"I am Canadian, but lived in the Netherlands for most of my adulthood in a student city (in a program with mostly German girls). 

During my first year as a student, I had constant sex with a girl for half a year, then slept with 2-3. In my second year, I slept with 8, and met my current gf, the hottest piece of ass I've ever seen. We've been together 5 years. She let me sleep with other girls, sort of, but I also cheated a few times. During my bachelor, I slept with a dozen girls mostly German, all between 17-22, all 7s and above (only one ugly, and one being the hottest in our program). Half of them I met from Tinder. I got twice as much nudes, and blew my chances to be with a lot more. Some of them actually wanted to date me seriously. 

Coming back to Canada, my gf lets me sleep with other girls because she's not possessive and she used to let me go to hookers in Holland so she just doesn't care. However, chirp chirp, my Tinder is like I'm shadowbanned. 1 match a month (obese girl), and that's it. In my new university, nothing at all. Didn't meet a single girl, except for a weird French girl who paid me drinks and touched my thigh but didn't want to make out (and another thot with wrinkles). I slept with a Canadian immigrant last year, and a 17 year old three years ago, my only Canadian girl since 2013. So since two years, I had less activity than in my worst 4 months in the Netherlands.

So what's up with Canadian women? Where are they? I realized that not only the most sex I've had was in Europe, but the most sex I've had in MY country is from my gf visiting for a month every 6 months. There was such an abundance in Europe that the most sex I've had in Canada was from Europe.

What's up with that?

Well if I look around me I kinda have an answer to my question. My generation in Canada is mostly immigrants hanging amongst themselves, and the few white women are like my sisters, either being only into non-white immigrants or having multiple short term flings. 

The best part is that I'm 177 cm, which is shorter than the average woman in that province of the Netherlands.",Congrats on being a disgusting piece of garbage!

OK, so I'm not here to crush anyone's true sexual orientation. In fact, I strongly SUPPORT people being who they are, WHEN IT IS SINCERE.

I've just noticed that the seeming *majority* of women on online dating sites are ""bisexual,"" ""heteroflexible,"" ""demisexual,"" etc.

I just have a hard time believing that this is a *sincere* trend. 

Maybe I'm wrong, but I just think a lot of people (more prominently women, it seems to me) have labeled themselves with these sexual orientations to lure people in or to show that they are (falsely) open-minded. Like it's cool to be a whatever-sexual, as if people will give you some type of ""social bonus points"" for those orientations.

Be as critical of my opinion as you please, I welcome open and frank opinions.","Up until very recently gay marriage wasn‚Äôt legal in the United States, and is still illegal in many parts of the world. There is still a long way to go where gay rights are concerned, but finally being something other than straight doesn‚Äôt mean you could lose your job and face a staggering amount of social stigma. 

Bisexuals are able to pass as straight in many cases, and some choose to do so rather than deal with the bullshit and hatred, and yes, people thinking you‚Äôre just looking for attention. More people are willing to be visibly bisexual now because it‚Äôs become more socially accepted and they no longer have to hide. "

At the end I went in for a kiss and got the cheek and was told ""I like to wait until it feels natural"".

I few years ago I broke an engagement to a girl I was with for 7 years because she just didn't show me enough passion or affection. Since then I have dated many girls for whom affection is enjoyed much more freely and those early signs translated into every day life with them; from little gestures like stroking my hair while watching a movie, to wild passionate sex.

So I read a lot into the very early signs of how someone treats physical affection and I am very paranoid about falling into a relationship again with someone who is uptight about affection and sex and so on. So I am taking this as a hard red flag, not really worrying about why it is she rejected it but just taking it as a sign things would not progress to a really physical passionate kind of relationship.

Am I being unfair?

The reason I don't entertain men who don't do these things consistently is to weed out time wasters. So many men out there are looking to waste a woman's time and extract gf benefits or casual sex without any intention of true interest. It makes it easy for them if they don't have to put any energy or time or money into it. So I make it ""expensive"" for them to waste my time. Last minute dates? Asking to come over? Asking to go on a walk? Even coffee or ice cream is a huge NOPE.

Men, dgaf what you think about this. Because I know all of you will complain because this makes it harder for you to get what you want from us for free. Women, take note and aim higher. Don't let him waste your time. Every man who has real interest in me has never even suggested low effort or free or cheap dates to me.

I cant stop crying because it confuses me so much. I dont get why exactly i desire sex.

I personally dont know if its good or bad to want and desire relationships and sex.

Here is a thing i noticed, i get demonized for desiring dates... i get told im disturbing for wanting dates and sex.

I want sex within a relationship, im told this is disgusting and women dont want relationships anymore! Not only this, but ive had friends who were women, who would... just kinda randomly have sex with hot guys, but tell guys like me i ""need more money"" or ""Need a better job"" or i need more hobbies and so on.

I have brought girls over to my friends houses just to be left in the living room while he gets his dick wet real quick FOR FREE for NO REASON.

While for me sex is on a condition i meet a bunch of prerequisites? why?

You wanna know what their hobbies are? Smoking weed, and sitting at their parents basement, and girls FUCK THEM. FOR FREE, while im told im not working hard enough.

I have tried the online dating route, and have had, tinder, bumble, hinge, match, meetme, POF, eharmony, badoo, and... i think thats it. Basically i have an account on every main stream dating site, and never get matchs.

To claim automatically when none of you know me at all, that its my personality is huge lies and just world fallacy. You want me to be sexless cause you think im ""evil"" when you dont even know me.","I'll clear up the confusion, but it'll be brutal, sorry. 

You're not attractive to the women you're pursuing. That's it. 

People who can easily have casual sex or get dates, can do so because they're attractive to the people they have sex with and go on dates with.

I like him and I know that he is interested for the least.

However he has literaly not asked to meet up yet, YES WE HAVE NEVER MET, he lives 3 hours away but I feel like it shouldn't be a freaking excuse.

A few days ago I straight up told him what my intentions were, that I am searching for something for something serious and I'm not playing, I asked him what his intentions were with me, because I had doubts if he just liked me as a friend, or is just playing with me or is searching for something serious. He said that he would never speak to a girl just for fun or to waste her time, and he added "" I want us to get to know each other and see how it goes"" .. so I took it as he wants to take it slow considering he had been hurt in the past.

i dont know why but I have a feeling he's talking to other girls.

So the latest thing that happened today is, he texted me in the morning and we talked a bit then, and then he stopped replying and now it's been 5 hours, which has never happened before, however I check that he just posted a story, if it's not hurtful enought that he's been online and not responding, the story was a video of a table of food and I noticed 2 glasses, and I immediately thought ""is he on a date?""

I need help please, an analysis of the situation, and if anyone has advice for me on what I'm supposed to do with this last specific situation, as well as the talking, should I just assume he will never come around and move on?

edit: turns out yes he was with a girl yesterday, but he later texted me ""oh hey i was at the beach with some friends this afternoon""

**edit : I am writing here literally asking for support and the comments who are making fun of my attitude and belittling my reaction are not helpful at all, if you don't have something genuinely you think is helpful to say then please don't make someone feel stupid for the questions they are asking considering that you don't know the full story.**",It's not too late to delete this

I never feel judged by him no matter what and he's just the sweetest person. 

The problem is. I'm just not physically attracted to him. I don't want him sexually, he's just not my type at all. For one, he has a beard and I hate beards, and I just don't feel anything sexual about him.. 

Sometimes I hate this because we have such a special connection and it's like why does it have to be like this!? He is attracted to me. We've had many conversations about it. 

I don't know what to do.. people around us see our chemistry and always instantly assume we're in a relationship. 

We've cuddled a few times but that's it, we've never kissed or anything. Idk why I'm posting this I'm just a bit lost. I want him to stay in my life but I get the feeling that pretty soon he's not gonna be around anymore because he's too heartbroken that I don't feel the same way about him..

(20F),"I (20F) know this probably gets asked a lot but this is a specific situation. My best friend and I have really similar faces and we act really similarly (we both act kind of weird). But I can't help but worry that guys would almost always pick her over me because she has big boobs (DDD cups or something, she told me at some point, and she's average weight i.e. softer body type) and I am a 32C but very thin (I have Zendaya's body type basically, just a few inches shorter).

I know if a guy is looking for a relationship, he will obviously think about the personality. But strictly based on body, would a guy almost always pick a girl with a large chest over a girl with a small chest? I ask this because we are so similar EXCEPT for our boobs, and it makes me feel really insecure. Someone choosing someone who looks like me, instead of me, is my biggest nightmare. I never was insecure about my body, because I have a very good body in society's terms, but in terms of attractiveness to guys, I feel like my body sets me back a lot. But I'm not sure if I'm worried for nothing, which is why I'm asking.

TLDR: If given the option between breasts on the smaller side vs breasts on the larger side, will a guy usually pick the larger breasts (without being ginormous I mean)? Not for a relationship, but just for sex.",Hell no! Small perky tits are the best üíØ

I‚Äôve been on and off the dating apps for years with no success, here‚Äôs my luck: 1) the attractive guys are just flighty/want sex, 2) the decent looking guys that have a decent personality are just too short for my preference and 3) the ones with the good personalities are just not attractive.

dating,11r0wah,2023-03-14 08:42:48,Do most women really rate themselves a 10/10?,"I sometimes get recommended clips from a podcast on YouTube. I've clicked on a couple different clips, and the guy will ask a group of women ""what do you rate yourself on a scale from 1-10""? 

99 percent of the time they will all say unanimously -""10 out of 10"".

Now, don't get me wrong, the question is somewhat vague because he doesn't specifically say ""how do you rate your looks?"". He just sort of asks them to rate themselves, which maybe the women are confusing for personal worth or something?

I don't know, I dont really understand how so many women ""rate themselves"" as a 10 out of 10. In my view, there's nothing wrong with saying something like "" meh, without makeup I'm like a 4."".

You can still have high self esteem while simultaneously being honest about your looks. Me personally, I rate myself like a 3.5 out of 10, because as a guy I'm only 5 foot 7 and I have fairly average features and I don't have a lot of money.

That's nothing to be sad over. I'm merely acknowledging that I don't really look like a ladies man, but I still can just laugh it off and enjoy life.

So, ladies, what would you rate yourselves on a scale from 1 to 10, without any makeup on? And what do you think most women will answer to this question?","Dude. What kind of question is this lmao

You sound bitter and I don‚Äôt understand what you‚Äôre trying to get out of this. You seem upset that women have‚Ä¶ confidence? Are you implying that they shouldn‚Äôt?

dating,11kxdjy,2023-03-07 11:57:45,"Any stories about men saying ""I love you"" first where it worked out long term?","So I've come to believe that the reason a man should wait to say ILY is that women need to feel safe in a relationship, and part of that is the psychological safety of knowing that you and your SO are falling in love at the same time.

  
Meaning, a woman doesn't want to date someone who is falling in love with her faster than she is with him - this creates an imbalance where she feels pressure to make decisions because she doesn't want to hurt you.

&#x200B;

After failing last time, my current position is: I'll never say ILY first, I'll just find non-verbal ways to let a woman know I love her and create that safe position where she feels free to say it because she loves me, too. 

&#x200B;

Anyway - back to the question - any situations where a man said it first and things worked out long-term (as in marriage)? Or did it usually result in a relationship that eventually ended?","That's fucking stupid. The path to falling in love is not some solitary journey that needs to be taken without the other person knowing about it.

In my relationships there are countless conversations about how we feel for the other at any given moment and how those feelings are growing and evolving.

Saw another topic on this recently and I'm really curious if there's any kind of majority consensus one way or another.

For me personally as a man, I will pay for dates either to be kind or because I know I have to deal with people's ingrained sexist biases and it's easier to just play along for a date or two until things even out. In general though, I refuse to date any woman without a career/financial independence. Not much turns me off more than a grown woman who is totally dependent on others, and having a relationship with someone like that seems borderline pedophilic to me. As if she is a child who is incapable of taking care of herself and has to rely on other people for everything. And I'm surprised that there are still people who believe that women should be dependent on men, ironically while other women are out there winning Nobel Prizes, inventing the GPS, curing diseases and saving millions of lives, etc.

That's just me though, what do you all think?","Damn‚Ä¶who is paying for a woman‚Äôs living expenses? Lol.

As for dating: if I‚Äôm asking a girl out, and I‚Äôm setting up the date, I am paying 100%. If the girl asks me out somewhere, I‚Äôm at least offering to pay 50%, but will not deny her if she wants to pay for it all. Guys that think they can ask a girl out on a date, and then expect her to cover 50% have no idea what they are talking about. That‚Äôs not what you do at the beginning of dating.

I get it he‚Äôs dorky, but I can‚Äôt help but have it keep going through my head that he might be gay. The sex is great and he seems to have a high sex drive and we always finish. Anyways, how do you tell if someone is closet gay and can you judge based on mannerisms (I.e. talking with your hands, very smiley, etc.)?

dating,t5p3qn,2022-03-03 11:02:12,"PLEASE READ, LEARN FROM MY MISTAKE!!! A warning to men. Learn who you are before it is too late.","Let me prefaces this with I never thought I would be writing something on reddit. But I felt this was too important not to share.  I am writing this post for two reasons. One to help men who might be on here, to help them learn from my mistake so they don't lose the greatest love of their life. And two, that the person I hurt might read this and find it in their heart to speak to me again one day.

I met the greatest love of my life online back in October 2021. She was stunning, and gorgeous, and smart, and strong, and independent.  Just amazing. We went to a movie for our first date, she was even more stunning in person. We got hot and heavy quick. Everything was electric. I felt so comfortable with her. I couldn't stay away. The second week we were together I spent the night every night lol lost a lot of sleep because I had to get up extremely early to get to work. I knew I wanted to marry this girl, I was going to marry this girl. I wanted to love her, comfort her, provide for her, take care of her, be loyal and honor her  The last good night we had together was Christmas Eve. That night will be burned into my heart forever.

But I started the relationship with a lie. I had hooked up with someone before I met her. She was a nice enough girl but I really wasn't attracted to her, just lonely. So when my girlfriend and I discussed previous relationships I made up a lie about my fling. At about the 1 1/2 month mark my girlfriend got cold feet and broke up with me.  Out of loneliness and desperation I reached out to my previous fling. She was down, but the very next day my girlfriend wanted to talk and we got back together. Now this previous fling, I came close to cheating on my girlfriend with her at the start of our relationship.  Hell, I might as well say I did cheat on her, though I never had sex with my fling while I was in the relationship; but it was so close that it might as well have been cheating. I ended up just ghosting her. So now that I was back with my girlfriend I had to get rid of the fling again. I had felt bad about ghosting her once, I didn't want to do it again.  I've never been in this situation before so I didn't know what to do. So I lied, I lied a lot. I led this other girl on, pretending to want to be with her while I was with my girlfriend. I made her think I was into her deeply, when I was really just buying time.  Eventually I just ghosted her again. She did not take kindly to that and started googling me lol. She found my facebook and the person I was in a relationship with then proceeded to send her screen shots of our text.  My girlfriend confronted me about it. I feared loosing the love of my life, I feared hurting the love of my life. So I lied, I looked her dead in the eyes and lied like my life depending on it. She knew I was lying. And for a month, she gave me chances to come clean and be honest, I just lied some more. Until she couldn't take it any longer and broke up with me on New Years Day. I eventually came clean but it was too late. She was kind though, agreed to wait a few day before she made a final decision. Unfortunately for me it was still to tell me to hit the road.  One of the last things she said to me was she forgave me and hoped we could be friends after some time had passed.

After all of that though, I was pissed, I was angry, I was full of hate for the other girl. I texted her and said a lot of terrible, disgusting, horrible things that I am ashamed of. No one should ever be told the things I said to her. I'm taking an educated guess that she also sent these horrible text to my ex-girlfriend. Because about two weeks after our break-up I had a sinking feeling something was wrong, my ex was hurt or in danger or something happened. So I reached out to her to make sure she was ok.  When I finally got through to her, the response I got was ""Stay away from me. Never speak to me again"". I have no idea what happened. But I found one of her post tonight. The things she said about me I found shocking, painful, hard to read. She said I was abusive, and narcissistic. Well, I never laid a hand on her. But if she felt I was abusive emotionally or psychologically, I didn't realize it, and her feelings are valid. I've never been diagnosed as a narcissist, selfish yes but I try to do better everyday, I suffer depression, and I have a personality disorder, I know these things and I'm honest about it, and I go to therapy for it to try to improve and be better.  But she does have a history of dealing with narcissistic people; so I have to take that to heart and believe it a possibility. I've tried to make amends with her. I sent her a two pairs of earrings, I told her I would take her to get her ears pierced but I kept putting it off. So I got her these earrings so when she did get them done she would have two nice starter pairs. But lol after what I read tonight she probably threw them in the trash without even opening the box.  

So the moral of this long winded novel is don't make my mistakes. J.J. was the love of my life. I've never been able to be friends with an ex before, never wanted to. But she is so important to me that I wanted her in my life. Now, I don't know if she will ever speak to me again. DO NOT MAKE MY MISTAKES. Learn who you are. Find your flaws, work on them, improve them. Become a better person now. And when you find that person you love, don't ever lie to them. Be honest. Doesn't matter if you fear losing them or hurting them. Be honest always. There is never a good reason to lie.  Take care of yourselves, become better men.

J.J., should you ever read this; know that I am truly sorry and remorseful for everything I did. I read your comment and I took it to heart. I will be better, I will improve myself and work on myself.  I just hope you will forgive me one day and reach out a hand of friendship. Until this I love you, I miss you, and I wish you the absolute best. I hope you find happiness. Never settle for less than you deserve.","Let's be honest, you didn't respect or love her. Why do you want her back? Loneliness again? What did you do to change your character so this bs doesn't happen again?"

That's making marrage an ultimatum and its extreamly manipulative. And if you want to marry a man so badly but he hasn't proposed to you then you should propose to him. Marraige is never the end all be all in a relationship and you should never treat it like that, but if you really want to marry someone dont wait on them to initiate it and try initiating it yourself.","Women who want to be married by a certain number of years should either make it known or just break up if it‚Äôs been ‚Äútoo long‚Äù.

dating,mcnhrg,2021-03-25 02:20:36,I want to apologize to everyone for existing and assuming at times that me trying to date someone is something I should attempt to do,"It‚Äôs all clear everyone. I get it. I am ugly as fuck. Like when anyone sees me they are simply immediately ready to move on to the next thing. There‚Äôs nothing going on here that you want to have anything to do with. I‚Äôve kept myself skinny and at least somewhat in shape. It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôve completely let myself go or something. I haven‚Äôt at all. I‚Äôm just not enough.

Beyond that, what I **am** is also unbelievably boring. I‚Äôm not sure why exactly. But it is a fact that no one wants anything to do with this. I‚Äôve never had a girlfriend. I‚Äôve never had a boyfriend. I‚Äôve never even been on a fucking date. I am apparently not dateable material. I‚Äôm not even sure anyone has even ever momentarily found me appealing in any way that you might say could be related to being dateable. I didn‚Äôt go to any dances or my Prom in high school. I never even so much as kissed a girl at a party in college. No one has ever wanted me to. I really believe that.

My positive attributes are not enough to override these things. My hobbies, my career as a doctor, my openminded and agreeable personality, anything else positive going for me. It‚Äôs not good enough. I am not valued. I am worthless.

I am sick of being worthless. I‚Äôve been worthless my whole life no matter what I accomplish or who I become. It‚Äôs never good enough. I‚Äôm at a point where I am obsessed with blowing my head off most moments of every day. And I am starting to think this is the way things should go. It is an appropriate ending for my stupid little life. No one ever valued me so I deserve to die. Might as well do it myself. I‚Äôm starting to consider going out and buying a gun in the evenings. I think I want to do this. I want to end myself.

I just wish I knew why I‚Äôm fucking predestined to be this fucking unlovable to everyone. Why I‚Äôm predestined to be so fucking worthless no matter what I do or achieve. I just can‚Äôt do anything about it. I suck. No matter what","Trust me, if you keep hating yourself this badly you're never going to make something out of yourself and even if you were to be in a relationship it's going to be very unfulfilling. You're not ready for a relationship, you have to start working on yourself from inside and out. Probably seek therapy, find out what you need to improve on looks wise (there's many helpful subs for that), get some decent hobbies.

dating,m6qdzq,2021-03-17 02:50:54,Is it a red flag to have the US flag in your profile pic?,I saw this point being mentioned a few times on Twitter and Reddit about the profile pictures with the US flag in the background. Some of my friends warned me that people with those profile pictures are usually white supremacists or KKK members and such and I should keep away from them. I am an American but I immigrated here a few years ago and my first language is Spanish. What is your opinion on that?,"it's worse than that, it's also white and blue"
dating,l7z6ig,2021-01-29 17:56:11,A complete misunderstanding of dating apps that some have.,"If you're a man who's either very average in the looks department or have some flaw that's not drastically made up for by something else, you need to come to an understanding about what you're probably gonna get from these apps.

I'll use myself as an example. I'm actually a pretty good quality guy in terms of ""mate value"". I'm 6' tall, decent face, got some muscle. I'm probably a 7 or 8 if not for the fact I'm a bit on the heavy side. But that's one flaw that's hard to get around until I drop a few pounds (which I'm already doing). 

I'm telling you right now the only reason I'm using tinder is for something casual. I plan on moving to another state later this year and I'm not looking for a serious thing at this point. But if I was, I would not go near any of these apps unless I was slimmed down quite a bit more. Because I know for a fact regardless of my build I can do better outside of OLD. 

I'm not saying cut your standards down to way below your league, but you have to manage your expectations. I realize some of these women are not the types I want to get too serious with, and I do my best not to mislead. But I also have a high sex drive and there's a major difference between a woman I'd have sex with a few times versus one I'd be with exclusively. And I'm not suggesting go have a bunch of unprotected sex all over town, but we all have needs. And the way some of you guys are complaining, my best guess is you probably need to get laid. 

If you're not willing to make some compromises vis-a-vis casual flings, you'd better quit relying too heavily on OLD or make sure you're on there looking like a hard 7 or better. And that's assuming you do everything else right, which isn't that hard to figure out. Like not double messaging/being needy, cringy messages, bios that make you look like an asshole, etc.

In a nutshell if you're not super attractive by the eye test, there's still probably a great woman out there for you. One you find incredibly sexy and great in many other ways. But all I'm saying is that same one who might find you interesting and attractive in person, probably wouldn't message you once on OLD if you even match with her. So if you're complaining about OLD not being what you expected, I hope I was able to give some insight as to what you should really expect. And hopefully you can make an informed decision of whether or not (or how much) you should be using apps.","If you‚Äôre not handsome, you‚Äôre much better off approaching women IRL than relying on apps"
dating,jpc1b3,2020-11-06 19:50:14,The best advice the men here are gonna get,"This is how your life should go.

1 month every year you should dip your toe into the water of dating, online or otherwise.

If after that month you're having trouble, flakes, ghosts, whatever, shut everything down.

The rest of your year is now for making $$$ and improving how you look.

Focus on no aspect of personal improvement but those two things.

Your personality is fine.

Who you are inside is great.

Nothing is innately wrong with you.

And when I say improve your appearance I mean...

Do.

Whatever.

It.

Takes.

Those improvements are the only improvements that matter.

And once you treat the game as it is you will begin to view it in the proper context.

Edit: 

To be clear, this is not the blackpill. We live in the most advanced age. There are so many options for you to improve yourself it's ridiculous. Just get the $$$.

Personality is supreme in relationships.

But relationship skills and attraction skills are pretty much orthogonal.

Attraction is primarily your looks. If you have problems getting interested people of the opposite sex, start there and only focus there: looks.

If you have problems in your relationships then you need to do some self work, probably some therapy (your attachment is likely fucked), i.e. personality.","Ah, yes. Focus on no other aspect of personal improvement other than physical appearance and money, the only important aspects for you in your life because I said so. Because your success is based on that and that's your goal, so others can like you maybe, next year?. Treat your life and people you get to know along the year to fit in your new stupid schedule.

dating,j2xwk4,2020-10-01 00:09:47,Preferring taller guys,"I recently just got on the apps and is it mean that I kind of lose interest in a guy when I find out that they are my height. I'm relatively short around 5'2 and tbh I prefer guys who are like around 5'5?  I feel so shallow. I met up with this guy and he was already sitting down when I got to the restaurant and we actually had pretty good conversation (ie. I babbled and he humored me cause I'm nervous babbler haha) and he seemed like a genuinely good guy, but when he stood up I realized that he was kinda short and he was pretty much my height and it kinda turned me off of him. Ah. I'm so shallow I'm so sorry to you guys out there.

And now whenever I look at a guy's profile pictures I try to estimate how tall they are and then I get sad because I feel so shallow. I've had guy friends who struggle with dating cause of their height and I always try to comfort them, but then I feel like a hypocrite cause I myself don't want to date someone my height or shorter than me. 

Anyway this is just me venting. I'm sorry dude you're super cool. I'm just a shallow and superficial :'(","I mean it‚Äôs just a preference of yours right? Just how I (23M) prefer girls who are in the 5‚Äô0-5‚Äô6 range. I need to be at least a couple inches taller than her. Don‚Äôt let it turn into a hatred towards shorter guys though, how some girls do when they say ‚Äú*If you aren‚Äôt 6‚Äô0 or taller you‚Äôre my sis*‚Äù. Like how fucking rude do you have to be to body shame a guy because he isn‚Äôt tall? It‚Äôs nothing we can control one bit.

This is not an old thing, as of the last decade or so it's become almost the status quo that 18 year olds are kids. I've seen some argue that even 21 year olds are kids. I have a buddy who's 32 dating a 19 year old uni student and they have fantastic chemistry and I don't even find it a little strange. Yet some of my friends go as far as to call him a total creep and far worse things. 18 year olds are adults legally for a reason, they're adults.

I'm over 30 and I think back to when I was 18, I had a pregnancy scare; was covered in tattoos and worked a full time 9-5 job and paid for my own stuff.

Seriously. I can't help I have literally 0% attraction to any and all black women and have a heavy preference to white - white-ish women. How is this my fault when it's not something I can help? I'll call you racist if you're not attracted to me. Ehy, see how dumb that sounds? People are all like ""but you're judging an entire group"" no.... I literally am not attracted to dark skin. I've seen literal thousands and thousands of black women IRL and many more via TV n whatnot. I've never found a single one to turn me on. Aesthetically pleasing yeah, in the same way I can look at a guy and recognize that he's good looking. But I'm 0% turned on by men. I'm not turned on by dark Indian girls either. I really only like my skin color and lighter. I'm also not a fan of natural curly hair or wide noses, any other type of nose is fine. I cant help it. Btw. I live in an area where over half the population is Black and 80 to 90% of the young people. So YES I've seen just about every shade, every height, weight, etc. Never been close to a single one.

And this is NOT even abnormal. It's very normal to have preferences to your own race. I'm not totally white myself I don't think. I'd probably count as ""Off-White"" or something. White ish looking but not totally white, I've got like olive skin color.

I'll also add probably most or at least half my friends are Black and I don't hate anyone based on skin color. N B4 someone else calls me a white supremacist.

I'll also add that I don't tell black women I don't find them attractive because they're Black. I pretty much do say "" Sorry, I'm not attracted to you. Hope you find someone though!""  It's just when I'm asked about it I give my honest opinion. ""Why do you never seem to find black girls hot?"" Why? Because I'm not attracted to black girls.  


And as far as is it racist? Is it? I guess so, in the same way it's homophobic to not date the same sex or trans people. But it's not hateful. I don't hate them. So tell me how I'm a bad person.","It's not racist to lack attraction to a race. It is racist to say ""I don't like black girls"" or ""I only like white girls."" That's a categorical statement on a race of people. I don't see why it would be hard to say ""Sorry, I'm not attracted to you. Hope you find someone though!"" and be done with it.

dating,2hp73h,2014-09-28 14:41:24,Ten things never to ask a woman,"David DeAngelo has come up with a list of ten dating tips to guide men on what they should never say to women.

The author of *Double Your Dating* says there is nothing worse than making mistakes that will later be regretted and one way to avoid them is to remember the following.

First of all, a man should never ask a woman if he can kiss her, as she will only say, a man should never ""ask"" for a kiss.

Asking her for a kiss will only make a man look like a boy, which is what a woman is not interested in, and even if she says ""yes"", it could mean she is just being polite, while on the inside her attraction meter will read a firm, ""No"".

Secondly, a man should never ask a woman if he can take her out on a date sometime, as she would like to be with a man who is a leader and in control, not someone who asks her permission to hit on her.

A man should confidently ask a woman out, by simply saying, ""We should hang out... what's your number?"" or tell her about a specific place he wants to take her to.

Thirdly, a man should never brag about the car he has or the kind of house he lives in, as it would seem like he is trying hard to impress her.

Women would be far more impressed by a man's material possessions if he does not mention them in conversation.

The fourth thing a man should never ask a woman is what she wants to do for the night, as she likes a ""man with a plan"".

The man needs to have a game plan before he calls her, so as to ensure that she will not be burdened with having to think about what to do.

Fifthly, a man should never ask a woman if she likes him, as this is one phrase that turns off a woman completely.

He should just assume that she likes him, and never ask the question, as it would look like he has no confidence.

The sixth tip is that a man should never ask a woman why she never answered his message, as one, it would show that he cared she did not reply back, and two, it would give her a guilt trip, which is seen as insecurity by women.

The seventh tip is that a man should never ask a woman how men she has slept with, as this shows that he is suffering from insecurity.

The eighth tip is that a man should never hint at a future date with a woman he has just met, as she not only wants but needs a guy who is somewhat of a ""challenge"", and will lose interest if she senses she has won.

The ninth tip is that a man should never end a phone conversation with a woman with a ""next step"", as firstly it would kill any spontaneity by being predictable, and secondly he would kill any chances of her calling him.

The tenth tip is that a man should never talk bad about a woman's guy friends especially if he hasn't met them and doesn't know her very well, as this is the fastest way for her to mark him as ""insecure"".

I've watched too much porn for interracial which i mean black male & white female.;

So i think i am misunderstanding the white women prefer the black men than white and Asian men.

Because of the sex. 

Are they the white girls (American) really prefer the black guys than the the white and Asian men??

Also, are they the white women hate for dating with East Asian male? Even the marriage? 

: The Japanese and the Korean.

Because i am Korean. The South

I've been still watching the porn of bbX Gangbxxg videos and don't know the truth of Western women.

East Asians have a lot of fantasy for white people's society.

dating,13va5v9,2023-05-29 23:36:04,"When men say that women should lower their standards, they are talking about PHYSICAL standards","Often times when  a man suggests that a woman lower her standards, the response is often times something along the lines of ""I would rather be alone that been in a @##@ty relationship.""

Men aren't suggesting that women enter bad relationships simply for the sake of being in a relationship. In fact, they are suggesting quite the opposite.

Most of the time, when a man says that a woman should lower her standards, it is under the following circumstances-

1. The woman strives to be in a relationship

2. The woman has an incredible number of likes/matches on dating apps (in the thousands or tens of thousands)

3. The woman complains about the dating scene/lack of options (despite evidence to the contrary)

When men say that she should lower her standards, they are specifically advising her to focus on qualities that actual predict long-term relationship success, as opposed to merely physical qualities (like height, looks, etc.).

They are also not suggesting that a woman needs to date someone who she finds physically unattractive. For example, let's say a woman normally only dates guys who are over 6ft tall. Assuming that she is happy with her dating life, most guys probably won't say that she should lower her standards. 

However, if she is unhappy with her dating life, many men may tell her something along the lines of ""Hey....what about all of those guys that are 5 ft 11? 5ft 10? Etc."" Yes, they are asking that the woman lower her height requirements a whopping few inches, but merely as a response to the woman's dissatisfaction with her dating life. In other words, they are trying to remind her that there is more to a relationship than a man's height and looks, although she need not completely be detached from those qualities.

None of this has to do with oppressing women and their ability to choose mates. If a woman expresses that they are happy with their current boyfriend/dating life, you will hardly ever see men telling her to lower her physical standards. It just wouldn't make much sense at that point. It's only when women pass up potential partners on the basis of an inch or two, and then complain about how little quality options that they have, that some men try to bring a little daylight into her dating choices.","As a woman I can say this is fair.  Women often confuse what their equal is in a relationship by mistaking the caliber of man (physically) who will have sex with them, vs the caliber of man (physically) who will treat them well in a relationship."

I(26f) got into a bit with my friend(27m), and I expressed my frustration on working so hard and not really having much time to do the things I love and enjoy. My body, feet,back, neck is sore and aching. It was 10/10 pain yesterday. Plus, I'm going to college and trying to keep up with my work. 

I'm not just exhausted physically but emotionally  and spiritually. Growing up, I've always wanted a lifestyle where I get to enjoy my hobbies, being a housewife, taking care of my husband, and making his life easier. Have a little part-time job because I enjoy it not because I have to. 

I told my friend how I'd like to marry a wealthy man and how I'm going to get fit and be more visually appealing to attract the kind of man I want. Yes, love is important, but I've dated for love and nothing else, and it has gotten me used and abused. So, I re-organized my priorities and placed love on the side for a bit. If the man I'm dating is a great guy and wealthy, of course I'd love him. I believe in growing in love. I'm definitely not going to marry a shitty guy for money. 

I tried to explain that to him, and he didn't understand what I was saying and seeking. I'd love a traditional lifestyle being a housewife with hobbies and part time job and doing things at my leisure and taking care of my husband.

I, a childless nursing student, was called a gold digger for wanting a traditional lifestyle that I believe only a wealthy man can provide, not just for me but for our future children as well.","Yeah sounds pretty sad to me, you just want to be a pet."

I firmly believe that everyone is chasing their own feeling of 'love'.

We began talking, and I made every mistake known to womankind. His voice was so smooth, and he comforted me, at a time where I was really in need. I'm 40+ and be is 30+. I am a gainfully employed, homeowner, whose brother lives with her, and he is practically unemployed living with his retired parents. I haven't dating in many years, so I must've come across desperate, and I basically was! He was going through a bad divorce, and the loss of a child, and I was dealing with a lot, and so we bonded. We spoke on the phone daily, and facetimed. We really couldn't date a lot, since he wasn't really working and I didn't want to totally turn into a cougar! Quickly we realized we had a sexual compatibility, and friends warned me about him. He started send D pics and D videos, like really. He knew what he was doing because he got into my head, and I became dic\*matized!!!! I invited him over, which I rarely do, because of my brother. My brother decided to leave for a few days, and that was probably the best thing, but I did not want him to feel inconvenienced. BACKSTORY: He stood me up on our first date, and literally borrowed money from me! Yeah, stupid, I know! I promised myself I wouldn't get emotionally attached....Next thing I know he's basically moved in and my brother moved out.

1. He stood me up on our first date.

2. He borrowed money from me.

3. He got three speeding tickets on my car, had all kinds of people in my car, and one of them vomited in my car and left alcohol bottles behind (and not even top shelf)

4. He got locked up, and is now in detox

5. He stored coke in my bathroom without telling me, sent his father to my house to get his belongings. His father asked to use the bathroom, I turned him down because that seemed weird and It was really early. After he left, I found the stash, and I can only assume he was trying to get it before I discovered it, Who does that?

6. After his dad didn't retrieve what he obviously was coming for, he called me from Rehab, but I never mentioned it!

7. He was unreliable, He is a rapper who is not employed, smh

He was literally the best sex I have ever had!!!

All that said, I still can't stop thinking about him, and I just hope he doesn't call me when he's home because I don't know if I have the strength not to take him back..... I really liked so much about him, his personality, like I really want to cry!!! I don't think I love him, but he told me he loved me. I don't completely believe him, but I miss him, and I don't trust my judgment!!

How do I get this man outta my system?","Yes ma'am you are dickmatized. I don't really know how to break the curse other than to be strong. All I can tell you is that it happens the best.

I noticed many guys always get a kick out of me being angry at them. Its like they're not bothered or threatened by it. E.g., instead of them wanting to calm me down, they'll egg on the behavior and laugh as if I'm being hysterical. 

But I still feel dismissed and invalidated. I've been guilty of sending angry texts. Like cursing the guy out. And the guy just just remains nonchalant without flinching. They'll apologize but act unbothered. Or in person, they'll chuckle and treat me like a pet by patting my head. 

I don't think they are weak either. With other men, they're always so quick to get aggressive and defend themselves.","A lot of men just don't do drama. If you start pouting and yelling, they'll brush it off and not let it get to them. It's hard to say whether they're being dicks, defusing your own aggressive behavior, or making playful jokes that you're taking far too serious. If you feel all men do this to you, that raises a red flag. You either make terrible friends or have a personality that provokes situations. Evaluate and communicate."

We were trying to arrange our first date because he lived an hour distant from me. We spoke on the phone frequently, went on a few Skype dates, and I felt strongly about him. He had an excellent career, was physically active, and didn't have any children, which was already unusual.

He eventually invites me to visit this botanical garden, which was two hours from him but another hour away from me, to view Christmas lights at night. the moment he arrived to pick me up. He was driving with two infants. He claims to be a father and that he lied to me. I was furious. But since he had just traveled an hour to meet me with these kids, I felt compelled to go on the date.

We stay outside for the full additional hour, but I'm still angry, so I'm not saying much. The infants are f(6) and m. (4). We arrive at the destination, and when everyone stepped out of the car, I saw that his daughter was completely unprepared. It was a chilly night, and she was dressed in a t-shirt, biker shorts, mismatched socks, and mismatched ballet shoes. Her wavy mixed-girl hair was also completely undone, giving the impression that she had just rolled out of bed when he carried her outside. WTF, I thought. I felt ashamed because I knew people would mistake us for her mother and wonder how the heck I managed to get her out there looking like that when I was rocking cute Gucci.

He wants to be totally focused on me and ignore them the entire time they're in pain. He smelled strongly of tequila when he was close to me, I also noted. They are now shouting, ""I hate you, dad,"" and telling me they don't like me. I'm sitting there like look I'm with y'all I'm starting to hate y'all daddy too. They had no access to food or drink in that area, and there was no small shop where they could purchase jackets. Look, I'm ready to go, I said.

It is now after midnight, so we are leaving. We leave and proceed across the city for about 20 minutes without stopping to feed the children. Oh, and he can't drive; he swerves all over the place and is probably intoxicated.

The kids are asleep when we arrive at the closest gas station, so I dash inside to purchase some snacks because I'm also hungry while I believe dad fills up the car. I spent at least ten minutes in the store because of the lengthy line. I went into the store to ask what was wrong when he started walking in and said, ""I need to pay for petrol,"" so I was like, ""What did he want me to fill his tank?"" He was standing by the pump when I walked out and got angry when he saw me.

He pays for the gas, gets on the road, and starts swerving erratically. He claims his phone is dead when we arrive at my house, which is around midnight. Don't I",
dating,11ivkq9,2023-03-05 12:06:13,How is dating going after losing the love of your life?,"What are your experiences with dating after losing a person who felt like ""the one"", or the love of your life?

Is it possible to fully open your heart again? Can you love another person just as deeply (or more) than the person who felt like the love or your life?

Or will there forever be this aching feeling... because you're not with the person that you feel you were supposed to be with?

I was dating someone just for a few weeks, and maybe it's too soon to draw this conclusion, but it felt like he was the love of my life. Since it ended, I have been feeling so sad. We've been apart for longer than we were together, but I miss him more every day. I genuinely feel that he's my person, and though I know that the intensity of my feelings might decrease, I'm afraid that it will forever hurt that I'm not with him. Yet I don't want to be stuck in pain forever; never being able to love like this again. I hope your stories can give me some hope üôèüèª.","It's a little bit hard for me to be open to new person, but I was in a 7 year relationship. I dreamt about my ex last night, leaving me again.

But a few weeks? I think you'll get over it. Sometimes you get into a funk and it feels like you're going to feel that way forever, and you can't imagine ever feeling better. But then one day you wake up, the sun is shining, it's a new day and you feel like yourself again. And if that doesn't happen, you can always spiral into depression and then get professional help.

dating,104b1sd,2023-01-05 21:40:03,(Genuine question/concern) Does not wanting sex make me undesirable?,"This is something I've been pondering for a while now, and it's really starting to bother me. I've come to realize that sexual intercourse/other sex stuff like that is completely undesirable to me. Honestly, if I knew why this was, I'd explain it, but I don't and it's a problem. I can't for the life of me figure out if I'm destroying my chances at experiencing love because of this or not.

Most things I see on the topic of sex are always overly conflicting.  
On one hand, I've seen people say you shouldn't expect sex out of anyone regardless of circumstance.  
On the other, I've seen others say that sex is a normal part of any relationship.

I'm not at all saying that I don't want/like physical contact; cuddling and spooning are two things that I very much desire. I want to feel loved and desired, but I'm afraid of that not being possible because of this factor (plus any other problems I may have).","Sex is an important part of a romantic relationship for the majority of people (probably the large majority), so many will not want to pursue a relationship for someone who does not share that desire. However, if you seek out other asexual or sex repulsed individuals, you may have better luck finding someone with the same relationship goals. 

Are you monogamous or nonmonogamous? Nonmonogamy may give you some greater flexibility with who you date, as you‚Äôre relationships with your partners can be only romantic while your partners have relationships with other partners that include sex."
