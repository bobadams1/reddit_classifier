dating,1471ube,1686509373.0,Am I Clueless?,"So there is this girl I‚Äôve known my whole life. We have a lot of the same ideas and similarities as to what we want in a future relationship. Well her mom and family members ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt you date (my name) we love him, he can cook, he‚Äôs kind, etc.‚Äù well she told me she didn‚Äôt tell them no just she wanted to think. Well here we are this week I picked her up to hang out and sleep over for a few days. Last night she slept in my bed with me. Nothing happened but it was an interesting moment. She said just the other day we would make adorable babies. She asked me one time if I would marry her in the future. When we are together and hanging out there‚Äôs this feeling like we both know but neither will make a move. Or at least that‚Äôs how it seems to me. Am I really just clueless and it‚Äôs been sailing over my head? Or is it something else?",
dating,1471t0w,1686509291.0,Is my Ex talking to the girl I like on purpose?,"The title explains it all but here's a bit of context for the situation:

Me and my ex met this girl 7 years ago because we went to the same school, then me and my ex met a year later and started dating 

Me and this girl flirted a decent amount when me and my ex took a decently long break a couple years ago (by this time me and my ex were going to different schools) but never mentioned to anyone and kept it to myself, but one time my ex after we got back together she woke me up and straight up told me ""I had a dream you were flirting with so and so, and you guys were kissing and i couldn't go back to sleep because of it"" and i got chills after she said that because I dropped contact with the girl and had to get over her (which was easy because we never did anything) and I hadn't even thought about that girl for like half a year at that point. We didn't even see each other anymore because I had moved. But regardless, i stayed firm and let her know i didn't have any feelings for that girl and that it simply was just a dream.

2 years later, me and my ex are in a horrible spot, our relationship is going downhill very fast and i got back on using social media, because I had lost contact with all my old friends and for some weird reason I'd drop every person my ex was insecure about or didn't like (biggest mistake, i lost my entire social life) so I'm back on IG messaging my old friends and liking post and my ex loses it, and avoids talking to me and tells me she doesn't want to talk to me, why? Because i liked a post that the girl had made. Nothing revealing, nothing to be concerned about and nothing thats inappropriate. So i didn't think much of it. So i was pissed. Because at this point I've lost friends, she went through my phone and blocked girls that were old friends that had nothing to do with me romantically, and has gotten mad about me liking simple post of my friends. And this is the last time she brought up that girl.

Fast forward a couple months, we broke up. It sucked but i came out okay, and she ended up dating the dude she told me not to worry about and I'm still doing my best to keep improving myself. so one day I had a dream about the girl and i was curious as to how she was doing, i clicked on a recent post and surprise my ex is in the comments being super supportive, the usual...  ""yassss queenüòçüíÖüèº"" and It's super weird because she was never like that and was super insecure about this one girl.

Now that sometime has passed this girl and me have interacted a few times (texting and liking each other's post) and it reignited the feelings i had when I was on that break. 

now where I'm concerned is that my ex is only gassing the girl up because somehow she knew i once had a thing for this girl and this is her way of is making sure i don't end up with her. What do you guys think? I plan on making a move but I'm worried my ex is subconsciously interacting with this girl on purpose as they were never close like that.",
dating,1471gsn,1686508506.0,Advice for Dealing with Anxious Attachment Style When Dating,"I suffer from Anxious Attachment Style.  It very nearly can destroy your relationship if your not careful.

Some things that I have to remember

Your anxious feelings will be at their highest in the first 2 months after meeting someone.  So you need to be extra careful in this time period.  Your going to obsess about whether or not they really like you, will you stop hearing from them one day, etc.  The first 2 months is the danger zone.  Be careful.  After 2 months you'll likely have an idea if things are going well with the person, and you will feel a little more secure, but you got to get through the first 2 months first without sabotaging the relationship.

Don't love bomb.  I'm guilty of this.  In your mind you think you're trying to show them how much you like them.  But in reality you are dumping all your insecurities on them.  Your love bombing them with an over the top amount of affection because that's what you want from them in order to get rid of your anxious insecurities.  Recognize your tendency to do this, and don't do it.  They will feel uncomfortable when you do this.  Instead, be more subtle in your displays of affection to them, especially early on.

Texting as an anxious type...it's going to drive you crazy when they take a long time to message you back, or don't message you as much as you hope they would.  Resist the urge to text bomb them.  If they take 6 hours to respond, just wait.  Wait.  It will be agonizing.  It will hurt.  You will feel like a drug addict that's been ripped away from his steady drip.  But remember this.  If you text them back with a 'where are you' or 'what's going on' or God forbid an angry or hateful type text, you will only make things worse.  You must realize that.  Being anxious only hurts your prospect with this person.  It does not help at all.

If they haven't texted you back for a long time, then they just don't feel like talking to you.  Accept it.  You must be vulnerable.  You must accept that the person you like does not want to talk to you right now.  You have to come to terms with them not being available or wanting to communicate with you 24/7.   But this DOES NOT mean they do not like you, or want to break up with you, or anything like that.  They just don't want to talk to you right now.  That's it.

Now, if they are always taking forever to get back to you, then yes, they probably do not like you.  But if they take a long time to respond to only 1/4 or 1/5 messages you send them and even take the time to explain why they took so long to get back to you, then they're probably someone who likes ou.

Avoid stalking their social media.  Do this, and your just adding fuel to the fire of your anxious attachment style.

Finally, remember that your far more likely to repel someone by being too attached and clingy, then if you were too distant and unavailable.  Anxious attachment minds think the key to winning someone over is going all in - but we think this because it's how we would like to be treated - and we like to be treated like this because we are unwell.  Remember that.  If you think you aren't doing enough, remember that it is better to be on the side of caution and do too little.",
dating,1471coz,1686508235.0,I want to send a letter to a guy I dated a few years ago.,"Ages at the time: me (26) him (29)

A few years ago, I dated someone for a short period of time. Maybe 3 months. During that time, we were together 4 days out of every week. We spent a lot of time. It felt like I knew him for a lifetime. He didn‚Äôt reciprocate feelings for me and told me I deserve someone who feels the same about me. I never saw him again and it broke me for a whole year afterwards. 

I‚Äôm in a very different place in life than then. I own my home, it‚Äôs beautiful. I have a great career doing what I love, I love myself more and know what I deserve. If someone isn‚Äôt willing to reciprocate my wants and needs, that‚Äôs on them. 

I‚Äôve gone on many dates, been in relationships since then, but I still wake up everyday, thinking about him and what could‚Äôve been. I‚Äôve never met anyone like him and it makes me sad til this day. He was the most charming, one of a kind, handsome man I‚Äôve ever met. I want to send him a happy birthday card and a handwritten letter, telling him how much he meant to me and how I adored him, and that I hope he‚Äôs doing okay. I know it‚Äôs not going to change much of anything, but I still want him to know. I feel like I never had real closure from him, or what his real reasoning was; not that it matters now.

LOL I am so fucking lonely
Recently my activities have consisted of hyper fixation on old Hollywood actresses and their tragic lives because secretly part of me wants to see myself in them. Every guy I‚Äôve ever had feelings for has chosen some other girl over me.
I can‚Äôt even be mad at the other girl because she‚Äôs just what he wants. But here‚Äôs the thing that fucking kills me inside:
If she‚Äôs the one that he wants, why does he even fucking bother me in the first place?? I make it very clear I am a good person, loving, loyal, and have my own unique personality and interests. I have integrity, yet guys always choose the next fucking girl that looks at them. 
What did I ever do to deserve this endless fucking cycle of being chosen and then left for someone else. It was shitty the first time but over and over again starts to feel like hell. Like I am living in my own personal hell. 
I‚Äôve taken up so many fucking hobbies I could write a book about the things I‚Äôve taught myself to do. I‚Äôve cultivated self love through hardships, taught myself how to sew, embroider, paint, knit, how to use herbs. I am beginning to fucking hate myself, 

I am never the first choice.

dating,14708qy,1686505627.0,My date found me crying at the end of our 4th date. Are my dating chances with them over?,"TLDR: got overstimulated, cried, date found me crying, now worried i ruined their perception of me.  


I have been dating this one person for about a month now. they're the second person i ever dated. I'm 20 and I have never dated anyone until i turned 20, so this has been really exciting for me!  
Things have been going really well. We have quite a bit in common, we're both ND (have adhd specifically), we goof around a lot, and we're both very physically affectionate with each other and cant go most dates without touching each other, usually just squishing each others faces, holding hands, playing with each others hair, head pats, snuggling, non-lip kisses, and the like.   
This was how we always were since our first date, which greatly shocked me at first since i have NEVER done like most of these things with anyone before and i hardwired myself as a kid to not touch anyone or get near their spaces, but at the same time, my heart felt overjoyed that someone actually liked me enough to want to touch me on purpose.  
For our 4th/most recent date, we went to a queer dance together. things were going pretty well. however, gradually over time, the dance became overwhelming, and the lights and sounds became overstimulating, even with the noise cancelling headphones i instinctively bought, and me feeling bad because i didnt really know how to dance too well and just really embarrassed myself whenever we'd go on the dance floor, which started to trigger my social anxiety. after like 4 hours of that, it kinda got to me, and once the dance was over, i ended up finding somewhere outside for me to have a moment, which turned into a cry, at.   


my date ended up finding me crying, and ended up comforting me. they even gave me a ride back home and hugged me good night. i appreciate them for that, but im worried that them finding me vulnerable like this this early may have changed their perception of me for the worst, even though they insisted otherwise. i'm slowly starting to realize that i might actually like this person, and i really don't want them seeing me cry ruin any future chances of us having a meaningful relationship. i dont know reddit, what do you have to say?",
dating,147045l,1686505325.0,I only go on a few dates a year because it always leads to disappointment,"https://imgur.com/a/XYYrUJA

30M

So I‚Äôm pretty active on dating apps and honestly I mostly use them to hookup or just something super casual because frankly it‚Äôs easier and there‚Äôs no expectations and disappointment 

With that said, I go on like 3-4 real dates a year (with the intentions of getting to know them). Most of the time it‚Äôs nothing special and I don‚Äôt care too much for a second date. But out of those 4 dates a year, one of them seems to get my attention and I want a 2nd date

So last weekend I had a date planned and was this close to cancelling it bc I was talking myself out of it. I decided fuck it and went. She looked better than her pics and we got along and I was definitely open to a 2nd date. After the date she said she was open to that too

And then she just really didn‚Äôt text me back for a few days and just assumed she lost interest and didn‚Äôt really mean it when she said she wanted a 2nd. Granted she‚Äôs not a big texter at all. Anyways she texted me the other day after a few days of assuming she lost interest. We planned a date for today so I got excited and then just got the text shown in the screenshot

Without overthinking things, I think she‚Äôs being genuine. I doubt she‚Äôd reach out to me otherwise. She easily could‚Äôve just not texted me again after the first date. But I can‚Äôt help but think into it and think ‚Äòof course this happened, I almost never want a 2nd date and when I do, they don‚Äôt‚Äô

I guess there‚Äôs not too much of a point to this post other than me venting. I just hate getting disappointed. Obviously I‚Äôll get over it if that‚Äôs the end of it but I‚Äôd like to play things out with her to see where it goes",

We have spoken about family, childhood, the future - but in a very natural non-overbearing way. The communication was amazing and he was making the effort to make it obvious he wants to see me also.We haven't been intimate (only kissed . It was going so well, we both felt really comfortable with each other instantly and really got along. I have been on a fair few dates/am usually quite closed off person but with him it was very different. but had to leave town for 3 weeks and he continued to message me, ask questions and carry on conversation whilst I was away and we had planned a date to see each other when I returned to town. But a few days before the date he let me know that he was going out the night before our date for a work event and was going to be really tired for our date. I said no worries, if he's not up for the date we can cancel, but he said no let's still do something. He then lets me know on the day of the date that he has to go out in the evening so we only had 2-3 hours to see each other ?? I still went because I wanted to just see what it would be like , he brought drinks and a blanket as we were going to a nice park in the heatwave.

Over the last two years, I have had four failed attempts at a relationship. I was the first one to make the move for the first three and really put myself out there when I was getting signals of mutual interest. They all responded that they really liked me, but weren‚Äôt ready for a relationship and didn‚Äôt want to do long distance. Surprise, they all turned around and committed to serious relationships that are long distance. 

In January I decided to take a break and do the emotional work to be happy single and accept being on my own, and that decision alone helped me a lot mentally. But a month into my sworn singleness, a previous acquaintance sent me a Happy Birthday message. ( In college we had mutual friends who thought we‚Äôd hit it off, but covid and life sent us in different directions.) I was skeptical and jaded, but I decided to let things happen and just see where the conversation lead. I didn‚Äôt even tell any of my close friends about him because I was tired of being ¬´¬†that¬†¬ª friend that is always a mess in the relationship dept. 

He took me by surprise. For the first time in so very long, he made me feel secure. I don‚Äôt really trust peoples‚Äô words anymore, but he started to win me over with his actions. He sent flowers, each with a small note. My sister found a candle she thought I‚Äôd like and he bought it, wrapped it up, and sent it to me with a hand written note. We started talking on the phone and the calls would easily last over an hour. That never happens for me because I never feel comfortable enough to be myself. Eventually we made plans to see each other memorial day weekend, and he was able to get off work early and change his flight to fly in earlier than we planned. 

The weekend was‚Ä¶incredible. He was affectionate with me in all the ways I‚Äôve ever wanted from a partner. Without having to ask. I never questioned or was suspicious of his feelings for me. And I admitted to myself that I was falling hard for someone that I hadn‚Äôt been expecting to even meet. Because for the first time in so many years, i loved the person I was with him as much as I liked him. It was so easy to be 100% authentic. 

But then things blew up. On the way to the airport he admitted that he has some stuff he‚Äôs dealing with, to include a recent divorce, that made him question his ability to do a LDR. Something he‚Äôd assured me he was dealing with in therapy when I had addressed it at the beginning of us talking.  It shattered me. Why make all of the effort to fly to see someone, even get an earlier flight, if he didn‚Äôt want to do long distance.

Because he‚Äôs neighbors and best friends with my sister and her long term boyfriend, and because I really felt we had something real worth fighting for, I reached back out and we had a long talk on the phone. In short, we agreed to keep in contact since he saw the possibility of there being an Us. But since then, all the effort has been on my end, and i get nothing but short one to two word answers. 

Reddit, I do not understand how such a 180 is possible. If i can‚Äôt believe words, and if actions can lie too, what is left to have faith in? This has utterly broken me, as I was sure we‚Äôd come out of the weekend a couple, with the strong possibility of marriage a few years down the line. 

TLDR I fell for a guy who reached out because he regretted not getting to know me. His actions both in person and over the phone demonstrated strong affection for me, bur It fell apart after an amazing weekend and neither my friends nor I can make any sense of it. Do I keep trying? Maintain some sort of presence in his life? Its how my sister got with her boyfriend, he just stuck around no matter what she said.",

I've gone out on one date before and it was fine, but I knew it wasn't going to go anywhere because the person I saw was moving out of the country that same week. I have previously talked to guys when I was in high school and college, but it was all negative experiences. For example, one was flirting with me and I really liked him, but he lied about being broken up with someone and when I found out, it hurt like hell.

Although I am not a fan of dating apps, I pushed myself to be on them to see what's out there. I have previously thought that I am not going on dates because I haven't found anyone who I like, however I started talking to this guy and I like him, but the idea of a date scares the shit out of me. I have gone on a date before with a guy who found me and DMd me on IG, but like I said, he was moving out of the country and I also realized we were better off as friends. I have been in therapy on-and-off for three years and every time dating comes up, I am just told to ""try it"". ""Just go out"", ""don't think of it as a date"" etc. but none of that works.

What's weirder is that I am an extrovert - I love making friends, going out and meeting people at parties/events, etc. BUT when it comes to going on a date with someone off of a dating app, I freeze up inside and panic. I may have an Avoidant Attachment Style, but not 100% since I don't have a problem opening up to people who have been friends with me/in my family circle. It's only with guys in romantic situations where I begin to panic. Any advice/help would be appreciated!",

dating,146xx2f,1686500070.0,Girlfriend called me horrible names to another guy yet claims she loves me,"Hi everyone,

My girlfriend (24f) and I (24m) had a bad series of arguments and we broke up. After we broke up, she went to her guy friend which was someone I‚Äôve been suspicious of since the beginning, and texted him pictures of me and called me weird, a crybaby, and a b*itch. 

Fast forward a week, my girlfriend and I start talking again and one of our boundaries is emotional cheating and how we shouldn‚Äôt go talk to other guys about our relationship problems. I had asked her if she talked to anyone during our break which originally was supposed to be a break up (we‚Äôve broken up in the past but it just turned into a break).

She claimed no and she was reassuring me no for weeks and would even send me screenshots. It wasn‚Äôt until I saw her phone where I saw these texts. I‚Äôm torn but she claims we were broken up. Although that may true, the way she treated and talked about me after our break up says a lot. 

She also lied all week when we were seeing each other and broke trust and hid texts, so I‚Äôm telling her that what she did was emotional cheating. Also, when we got back together, she told me that in her head, we never broke up and she only thought me and would never cross a boundary. I‚Äôm torn because she went to great lengths to hide these texts from me and send so many notes about she did nothing, plus she didn‚Äôt just talk about relationship issues, but completely degraded me. I think I lost all trust. Is the relationship over?

Even before this period I was turned down by the two women I tried dating after I broke up with my ex.

Since I started trying to date again I either get turned down or we don't make it past the first date. I had a date the other day, it was pleasant but the conversation wasn't flowing, even though we'd met before and got along really well. I was gonna call her the next day to say maybe we should try to do something else next time as the conversation got a bit dry, but before I could she text me saying she'd rather just be friends.

I don't really get many chances to date as I don't really know anyone, and I don't mind if people aren't interested in me as two people need to be mutually interested in order for it to work, but damn, this has never happened to me before. Just getting turned down over and over.

dating,146x90q,1686498427.0,Should I post myself with another girl to make her jealous? (IMPORTANT),"18M-18F - both in college. So I'm in an exclusive fwb with this girl. By that, I mean that we only kiss and sleep with each other, but are not a couple. We got to know each other in late March, we went out a lot since then, had sex almost every time and we vibed very well. In early May, I told her I liked her, she said she liked me too but needs time to think because she was scared of commitment, she also had a 3-month rule where she would not get into a relationship with anyone before knowing them for 3 months. She suggested we become exclusive and postpone the relationship thing till later because I was gonna travel for 6 weeks at that point. I'm currently traveling on vacation and have 2 more weeks until I go back to her.

Before I left, we agreed that we were gonna call a few times per week and do one online activity together per week (Netflix, online games, etc..). When I traveled, she did not look like she was THAT interested in this, so I honestly never pushed to make it happen and she never brought it up either. Throughout the first 2 weeks of long distance, I was putting in most of the effort, but she was always down to go on calls and she would talk ( we usually called once a week ). I think it's also important to note that she is a full-time university student and works 2 jobs (usually 6-12 hours every day in just jobs).

2 weeks ago, we called for 20ish mins and she looked very stressed so I decided to be nice and door dash her favorite cookies to her place. Her reaction was not as good as I expected, but at least she looked happy, and made her day better. After she said thank you bla bla, I liked the message on iMessage and have not texted since to see if she would text first. It's been almost 13 days and I got no text from her. 

Part of me is telling me she's busy, she has no reason to text you when you're overseas and can't meet her in person, and that I should just not text her either until I'm back. The second part of me thinks she's fucking someone else rn. We are exclusive tho so maybe I'm just overthinking. 

I know the obvious answer is: communicate with her. But should I really do that? we are not really in a couple-type relationship and I don't want to seem clingy when I'm overseas and can't meet her for 2 more weeks. 

So I went on a date here with this very attractive girl. I don't really have interest in her and I made it clear with her after the date, but I did take a photo of her with the food at the restaurant that we ate in. Should I post it on my close friends Instagram story to make her jealous and possibly put more effort? or is that just gonna backfire in her doing the same thing? I still got 2 weeks overseas so it's risky. 

Please advise me on what I should do. Thanks a lot! 

TLDR: FWB has not texted me in 2 weeks. Should I post myself with another girl to make her jealous?",My goal right now is to maintain the fwb with her. I don't really care about the relationship that much anymore.

I‚Äôve been chatting to this girl for about a month, she‚Äôs my mates gf‚Äôs friend and things were going well. I met up with her and we were quite drunk but spent the whole time with her arms wrapped around me. Second time was a bit more awkward but we got on, she was leaning against me and we didn‚Äôt stop chatting once we started.

Now a few days ago we met up again and it was just not really the same, and her replies got a bit worse but then she always said how much she liked messaging me. She says flirty things but then also treats me like just a friend, lots of mixed signals.

But also calls me mate and bud when she doesn‚Äôt know what to say.

Yesterday I was drunk and so was she and I just text her and ended up just saying that I couldn‚Äôt tell what her intentions were and she just avoided the question, went to bed later and now she‚Äôs being really standoffish and weird.

dating,146w8v3,1686495955.0,I‚Äôd convinced myself I was unattractive and not worth dating; now a cute girl wants to go on a date with me and I‚Äôm terrified,"
I‚Äôve always been an ugly duckling and growing up I had no romantic experience, I really got myself down about it and it really messed up my self esteem but over time I started caring less and less and just numbed myself to it. I still have really bad self esteem but I don‚Äôt torture myself over it all, I just had the attitude of it is what it is. I‚Äôd missed too many milestones, I was too far behind, I wasn‚Äôt attractive and I was too boring, so how could I ever date anyone?

Lately though things have kind of changed. When I go out women flirt with me. I get quite a few matches on dating apps and a few times it‚Äôs almost ended up in a date. But there‚Äôs like some part of me that still fundamentally believes nobody could ever want to date me even though it‚Äôs an irrational thought. I‚Äôd totally convinced myself nobody could possibly be attracted to me, and I end up getting in my own way when it comes to dating. I‚Äôll not respond back with flirting, I‚Äôll ghost people who seem interested on dating apps and find some minor fault that means we won‚Äôt be compatible, etc.

Last night I matched with a girl on tinder who I‚Äôd have said was out of my league. We totally just hit it off. She‚Äôs smart, she‚Äôs funny, she‚Äôs cute, I got her number and we were texting for hours and she said she was really attracted to me and loved talking to me and that she‚Äôs down for going out and grabbing drinks.

And I‚Äôm terrified. Because now this is making me have to confront all my fears and anxieties. Cause there‚Äôs the truth; people can want to date me, people can be attracted to me, and I can‚Äôt run away from it all forever out of fear. I can‚Äôt rationalise my way out of the fact we have chemistry, I can‚Äôt find a single reason not to go on a date apart from my own insecurity, and if I don‚Äôt take her out I‚Äôm basically just admitting that it‚Äôs nobody else that‚Äôs the problem, it‚Äôs me.

I can‚Äôt keep letting my anxiety and fear dictate my life. I‚Äôm just so terrified to go on a date, I‚Äôve never been on a real date in my life, I‚Äôve never had sex, etc., and what happens when she realises how inexperienced I am, or how ridiculously nervous I am, or a million other things that could go wrong happen? My instinct is just to stop replying to her and forget it happened, but I realise how unhealthy it is. I can‚Äôt keep living like that forever, I need to face all my fears at some point, but it just feels so overwhelming.","A lot of people grow up being bullied and then when they are an adult they don‚Äôt realize everything has changed.

dating,146veqv,1686493895.0,How many people have you hooked up with? And has it improved your dating life?,"This is just something I have been wondering. To each their own, but I am curious. Call me old-school, I am a heterosexual women who prefers to only have sex in a committed relationship. But what sparked my question was learning that a lot of friends, who I go to college with, prefer the occasional hook-up rather than relationships for now. Is this a result of the culture in America? How many people did you have hook-ups with in your life? ","OK .. Let's get the perspective of both genders in here. 

&#x200B;

As an average guy .. Well .. It's not really all that talked about, but I can't go out and be ""I want to be in a committed relationship with feelings all all sorts"" 

&#x200B;

I'm not going to get a lot of interest from women and when I do they tend to be weary as to whether I'm ok or just some desperate dude looking for ANY woman. The only way for me to get a relationship is to go this route:

**Chemistry/fun -> sex -> ??? -> more sex -> relationship**

All the way never being the slightest needy or pushy. Feelings and talking relationships is better saved for later else I'll get the *""You're a great guy, but I think we should be friends""*. 

&#x200B;

That is one thing .. The other is that we don't have sexual chemistry with ALL people .. Most of us have experienced meeting someone that seemed swell and once we got naked it all just fell apart with the sex just being awful. They smell wrong and everything is off. There is an element of biology to the sex act. 

The DeadBedrooms subreddit is filled with horror stories of people that waited until marriage and then discovered they where absolutely not compatible sexually. 

I'm not dating for ages only to discover that the sex stinks. 

&#x200B;

I'm old (50) ... Struggled until my mid 20s due to not realizing the above and then met my wife at 32 and was married for almost a decade.

Mon - Bible study  
  
Tues/Thurs - Climb with friends  
  
Wed - Chores  
  
Fri - either dinner with friends at a pub (I dont drink personally) or a walk in a local nature area/park.  
  
Weekends - Im usually doing something. Skiing, climbing, going to the farmers market, I recently joined a volleyball group which I found through friends.  
  
I have also asked friends if they know of anyone but that always turns up dry so I dont ask that often.  
  
So beyond what I do, what do people mean by ""put yourself out there""? What else can I do? I am social and friendly whenever I meet people. But no one really seems to notice me, or notice that I am single. Even if I try to flirt and ask girls out. On top of that it seems that no one else is single.

dating,146tyfy,1686490085.0,Is she interested or just being friendly?,"I am following a specific class once a week and since a few months there is a new girl in this class. For a while we have been greeting (like a nod or a simple smile) each other when passing by in the hallway without having talked before. 

I really wanted to talk with her, since she seems very nice and looks attractive. The thing is, during this class she is always with two other friends, so it is difficult to start a conversation. Eventually I did manage to speak with her a few times, but the talks we've been having were very brief and really basic smalltalk. 

Now when she sees me when I am in another class or when she is passing by she always has a big smile and sometimes even waves enthousiasticaly at me. However, when she is with her friends she doesn't do this and completely ignores me. This also happens when we are in the same class and her friends are there. She doesn't even acknowledge my existence.

dating,146tptd,1686489403.0,Do you think gay dudes have lower standards for sex and dating than women do?,"Tinder, when I accidentally toggled the preferences to any instead of just women, at least 30 swipes from dudes shot in within a day. Usually I only get around 10 or 15 a day from women.

Another huge factor is that the men that swiped on me were really really good looking. I'm talking Calvin Klein model type shit. Half of the guy dudes on there were looking for something serious, the other half something casual. If you're wondering why I looked into their profile if I'm not interested in men, it's because I wanted to know out of curiosity from the men thag are into me, what sort of dudes are interested in me. 

In real life, I've been cold approached by a dude two times in public asking if I'm into men, which I'm assuming is implying they found me attractive. I've never been approached by a girl though.

On reddit, I made a post on a sub with my face in it and got a FOURTEEEEN DMs from men, most of which were pretty direct and flirty which sorta stroked my ego, but it left me wondering with all this what's up since I've never had a girl slide in my dms on reddit. 

Do you all think men have lower standards for men than women have for men? Maybe I just look a certain way that men find especially attractive or maybe there some other factors at play.

Also, it'd be cool to hear if anyones had the experiencd vice versa being a woman and attracting lesbian women, but not men.","Oh yeah ... but also

&#x200B;

From a gay perspective:

If you have 1000 single men .. then something like 50 are going to be gay. Having a dating pool of 50 guys is easily manageable .

From from a woman's perspective:

Out of those 1000 men something like 950 are straight. If she isn't particularly attractive then there still are going to be 300-400 of those guys willing to sleep with her. If she is the slightest attractive then all 950 guys will want to sleep with her.

We still follow each other on social media.","There's no universal right or wrong answer here, as it depends on the specifics of your situation and how you both feel. That being said, here are some things to consider:

- Reflect on why you want to reach out: Are you genuinely interested in rekindling the relationship or are you feeling lonely or nostalgic? 

- Understand her feelings: Remember, she expressed that she was looking for something easy and simple. Reaching out might lead to complex feelings for both of you.

- Be ready for rejection: There's always a risk that she might not be interested in reconnecting or she might have moved on.

- Evaluate your feelings towards the issues that led to the breakup: Have you really changed your ways? Do you think you can prioritize her this time around?

If after considering these points, you decide to reach out, it's important to be respectful and sincere. Mention that you've taken time to reflect on the situation and express your feelings without any expectations. However, respect her response, whether it's positive, negative, or indifferent."

I'm not saying this is an arrogant way to go - I just know it's not too bad for an average looking woman like me.  
  
So far, I've talked to two men about their dating experiences. One is a friend of mine and the other is a guy I just dated today. Both are pretty good looking guys and very nice. They both told me that they had a hard time even getting a match, let alone a first date. It made me feel bad for them, especially the guy I went on a date with today, because he was really a cute guy. I could tell he was nervous. ...... When he said he had no luck and was surprised that I had matched him, it really got me thinking. Is it common for even cute people to struggle to get dates? It seems like the world of online dating is frustrating enough, but maybe it's so hard for men.

I had a great first date. Texted him first and told him I had a great time and that ""next's one on me"".

Second date yesterday. Took him to lunch, had a more thorough personal conversation, he offered to pay half but I told him no lol (said maybe next time or we can take turns lol). Went back home, got funky, had a lot of fun and he had to go back home that same night because he's got return ticket home.

At the lunch date, I did tell him I don't like two-timing people and I much prefer to keep talking to on person at a time. He said it depends on the person so it's understandable. But the night was a great and he couldn't perform (but he did drove me over the edge and I got there in the end - even managed to do a porny-thing I never thought I could do!). He looked so happy he managed to do it lol

So now we're getting to the 3rd date.

I was thinking I'd tell him I want to stop talking to other people and see if he thinks we could do that together. I just really like him and he said the same thing, and he texted me today to say he'd love to see me again. But at the same time, I don't want to rush him.

Is the 3rd date okay or should I wait a little longer? And what about the other matches? Do I meet them still? (Tbh I don't feel like it because I really, really like this guy)

\*This is the first time I started (real) dating and while I do have some matches, he's so far the one's that straightforward when setting the date (he literally set up a meeting after we got to know each other on Bumble) and he's consistently been texting me since","It sounds like you're really enjoying getting to know this guy, which is wonderful! When to become exclusive or stop seeing other people really depends on the individuals involved and the pace at which your relationship is progressing. If you feel comfortable and ready to have the exclusivity talk, the third date could be a reasonable time. 

That said, it's crucial to be open about your feelings and not pressure the other person. Explain why you feel ready to stop seeing other people, and ask him how he feels about it. 

As for your other matches, if you don't feel like meeting them because you're really interested in this guy, it's perfectly okay to focus on him. However, it's advisable to keep an open mind until you both agree to exclusivity.

Remember, every relationship is different, so there's no absolute right or wrong answer. It's all about how both of you feel and what makes you comfortable."

i've basically never dated. i went to a really small priv school up until junior year, and only made a few close friendships before i graduated. i've never kissed, held hands, etc. i have a complete lack of experience when it comes to the opposite sex. i'm currently using the dating app Hinge, and it's been pretty much a complete waste of time. it's the same in-app purchase/upgrade scheme that i guess all dating apps are based around now. 

i'm worried that my lack of experience at this age will be a turn off to most potential dating partners, especially when most guys have had multiple by this age. actually if i'm being completely honest, it's really affected my confidence and self-esteem. i feel extremely unusual and abnormal at times, like an anomaly or something out of the ordinary. it also makes me think that i'm not capable or masculine enough sometimes. i realize that i'm probably not the only one in this situation, but i guess since i expected it to happen by now it's sort of a repeating cycle of disappointment. but what do you guys think, is it as embarassing as i think for a guy in his early 20's to not have his first kiss?","Don't fret about it too much. My personal experience is that I had my first serious relationship at 22 towards the end of my time in college. Experience in anything can make you more confident at it, but consider that a lot of people's experiences may be negative or unpleasant as well. The key is to prepare yourself as best you can before dating: sort out your mental and emotional health so you're content and happy living single, you don't feel pressured to date someone to prove your self worth, and you are capable of honestly communicating your feelings with people.

After you've taken care of those traits, the rest isn't nearly as bad. The physical intimacy experience is easier to learn on the job if you're going into that with a mindset of respecting consent/boundaries, relaxing, and making sure you're both having a good time. There are books people recommend often that encourage prioritizing the woman's orgasm. I think it's called ""She comes first""."

We are talking for almost 6 months online and since we haven't met in person (long distance) and I think he's not interested, we decided to just stay friends. But even if we just stayed friends, we talked everyday and obviously I developed feelings and got attached to him (I hate myself for that). However, when I found out he has started seeing other people, it breaks my heart knowing he will soon be in a relationship and I will be left out in the cold.

dating,146rp8a,1686483339.0,I want to ask out the cashier at my local goodwill but I'm terrified..,"Hi everyone, so I'll try to make this as short as possible. There's this girl that works at goodwill and for the last few months I've been developing somewhat of a crush for her. I kind of think she likes me too because there have been a few signs (but I'm not 100% sure, I could be misreading) for example: she always uses the word ""hun"" to address customers, and in fact this is how she originally addressed me the first time she checked me out. However, as of recent, she's started addressing me as ""love"" ex: ""thanks love, have a nice day"". She's called me that on more than one occasion and I've never heard her call any other customers ""love"". Another thing she did that I think is a sign she likes me is that she gave me 3 stamps on my blue card one day out of nowhere (for those of you who don't know, some Goodwill's have a thing where if you spend $10 you get a stamp on your blue card and once you get 10 stamps you get $10 off anything in the store.) Now obviously, she's not supposed to do that but she did it for me, am I misreading this? 

Anyways, I've been thinking about her a lot and the plan I've come up with is to maybe slip her a note with something along the lines of ""hey, I think you're really cute, you can text me if you'd like, my name is ***** btw"" and then put my number obviously. 

Another idea I had was to maybe wait until one of the days where she's stocking items on the shelves so that there aren't a bunch of other customers/co-workers around and maybe just be like ""hey, it's 'her name', right? I hope this isn't awkward but i think you're really cute and you seem really fun, I was wondering if maybe you'd want my number?"" 

Does this sound like a decent plan? I'm just really scared because I don't want to misread and make it awkward because I shop at this particular goodwill a lot.. also, I've never actually really asked a girl out, I've always just met women on dating apps, so I'm just really nervous but I'm afraid if I don't I'll miss my chance.

*Edit* autocorrect","Go for it.  But not with a note.  Put effort into saying something.  I'd probably say something along the lines of ""hey I think you're cute and would love to talk with you some more and get to know you.""  Leave your number on a paper. But leave it at that.  Don't hit on her on the line unless she openly says she's interested. Leave her some time to think without the pressures of her coworkers, customers, and most importantly you. 

To avoid awkwardness afterwards don't dwell on the results of her response.  Keep conversation casual like it was before. It's only awkward if your too persistent or too emotionally affected by the response

Good luck"

No sex yet but lots of foreplay etc., we went down on each other. One time in bed I kind of accidentally indicated that I don‚Äôt want sex and that I‚Äôm afraid or something like that.

But that‚Äôs ABSOLUTELY not the case and sex would have definitely been on the agenda next time we meet. Thinking he lost interest after my remark and won‚Äôt even make time to meet for another night, thus giving me no chances. 

Just happened, idk, maybe I was making a joke or something, I quickly forgot about it. But when he postponed meeting after meeting, I started to analyze what may have gone wrong and realized this might be it.

If the woman is part of your daily life, it's probably best to go the friends route and see if anything develops and have that conversation later.

dating,146qed1,1686478995.0,I (M17) am trying to pursue this girl (17F) as I've discovered that we share the same feelings. But there's a problem. [Serious],"So, it's been a month of pursuing her, and it's worked out well (in fact, I could really say that I feel like she's the perfect one for me).

And as I've tried to seek approval from my parents, in order for the relationship not to be strained, and work out well, my mother told me quite a.... revelation.

I don't really know how to react to it, because I didn't really want to admit that it could be true.

Apparently, the girl has had two exes, and she told me that herself. But apparently, she has had history (w/sex) and apparently has been made an issue of (because the guy had done her, and made her the talk of the town, which brought her, and her family to so much shame. Which in the end led her to almost taking her own life, which was fortunately prevented.)

And now, my mother told me that she also has a massive disapproval of the girl, since she dresses skimpily (which isn't that big of a problem for me) and that she has had the history of getting her virginity taken, im which, she's really worried that if I were to end up with her, she's most probably going to leave me for another guy. 

I can say for myself that the girl is quite the innocent soul, and is what one would definitely love. I fell for her even more after knowing of that.

Before I get possibly jumped on or anything, I want to say that, if she's had exes, it's not a big problem for me, so long as the girl herself stays faithful, and really treats one kindly in kind, and is also willing to work on the relationship to make it work out. However, it's kind of a different matter since it concerns her virginity, and I'm not really that well-versed in this kind of matter, and I don't really know what to do with that in mind. I would most certainly hate it if the woman I love would turn for another man's dick if her boyfriend is away, but I don't also want to judge immediately after just hearing from one side only, I want to hear from multiple parties, in order to establish an unbiased opinion, but I don't really know if what others would tell me is actually factual and really true.

Please help me, enlighten me, because I love her, and I don't really know what to do now that this predicament has faced me, it's also my first time actually dating.","Where are you from? I don't think most people in the West really care about virginity in that way, especially not someone's parents. Also, you should probably realise that, at 17, it is more than likely that eventually you guys will grow apart and break up, you're so young and have a lot of growing to do still"
dating,146q301,1686477910.0,A good love story up to the 2nd date,"I met this girl a month ago, as we had to do a small class project (3ppl) for a common subject in my masters and watch a stream/work in the library. She was very well dressed, in heels and long blond hair; I remember feeling intimidated and me focusing on the work to avoid thinking of her, I got so much done in that hour and although it wasn't my intention, that impressed her. We started talking here and there, she made me a gift and the day of the delivery she invited me to her country (we are both international students). I don't usually wear cologne in class but you bet that day I had it on. I was leaving in a month by that time so I said we (and our mutual friend) should meet before.

After meeting a couple times, and many many signs from her (I was scared of misinterpreting them) I invited her to ""hang out"", clarifying, just us. Before the big day, which hasn't even arrived, we went to have some ice cream after a long day of studying. It was romantic, very messy with the ice cream but also funny. I'm kind of shy so when we parted, I was at her door and kissed her on the cheek. In my eyes it was awkward but I think it's still a win because at least my heart didn't break out of my chest and left me unconcious on the street...

Having to study hard these last 2 weeks is just adding fuel to the fire. I manage to concentrate but at night and when I wake up, her is all I think about; my heart aches and I am short of breath. Last night I was hoping it wasn't all a dream.

A day later I message her, to roughly let her know the plan for our date (I read it gives something to look forward, and well even though I believe she trusts me, it's better for her to know where she is going). Not gonna spill what happened in the convo, but we want each other. When I pick her up for the date, I want to embrace her by the hip, look her in the eyes and get really close, whisper how beautiful she is, ""may I kiss you"", kiss her on the lips, and gift her purple flowers. The evening after that would be glorious.

We then would go to the movies and watch The Little Mermaid, drink, dine, walk through a very very romantic place (this is Italy) and I would accompany her home. I have no ""sex"" thoughts on my mind, I don't want that to happen yet. However, I haven't in my life felt this need to have a woman in my arms, to run my hand over her blond hair and fair body, to kiss every inch, to feel her warmth on my skin. If the date goes well, perhaps she tells me to go upstairs, and we cuddle and whisper for hours, falling together asleep. ***Do you think she would like that? If you are a woman, would you like it?***

By then we will have less than 2 weeks left, and it's exam period so even less time. My mind may try to hide the fact, but my body knows it. I do not give a single damn if I have to take on a long distance relationship with her, but still, let's make the most of the little time we have.

dating,146phgv,1686475773.0,Opinios on relationship (f19)(m27),"So i've got two friends who are in relationship for 4 years, they broke up for a week a month ago (their second break up). Now they are back together and the ralitionship is a bit better but slowly going back to what it was. I talk a lot with him and with her, over the past month i got really close to her and she is an amazing person, who supports him no matter what. I talked to both a few times about ther relationship as well so i know both of their opinions. A quick summary:

Her: i love him but i know but relationship is not that healthy, right now i dont have a reason to leave

She does all the right things, goes the extra mile for him and so on.

Him: 
-low sexual attraction
-sees a problem in lack of common interests
-said he still doesnt really understand her after 4 years, as a person
-last two years of dating were bad
-bad communication outside of sex, they dont talk about anything really
-no common interests
-finds the realtionship pointless at times
-doesnt see the relationship with her in the future
-finds it hard to be with her at times

Some other things to mention, he often doesnt pick up the phone when she calls, likes to drink a bit too much, mentally not doing too well, before the break up, he'd often tell her he doesnt want to see her for a few days, he would prefer to spend time drinking than with her, no romantic dates, relationship is mostly about what he wants, they had little to no sex before the break up.

Since the break up, they didnt see each other for a week, then went back at it. For a week he was nice to her, a proper boyfriend, now it seems like he's slowly going back to the way he was. They do have sex almost everyday, but besides that...

My question, why do people stay in such relationships, for how long can such a realtinship last, why wont he just leave? Or she? I mean i know her reasons, the sex is good now and if she left she fears he would hurt himself or even commit suicide. How long till they break up again? 

His mom and dad are in loveless relationship and the way things are going my friends might end up in one as well. Im afraid he is just using her when he feels bad and for sex, is that possible?","Even if you know all the details about their relationship, you can't understand no matter how hard you try, because you never know how and what it feels like to be in that relationship since you only view them using a third persons point of view. Trying to fit on somebody's shoes is way too different than actually fitting those shoes. Another thing you can't understand them because you are not them, you have a different outlook on life, principles, morals, character, preferences, and more. In short, you're not her nor him just let them be, they're adults they know how life works. Don't meddle in their relationship it's theirs just be there if they need some help don't go overboard. One day those friends of yours will realize and then decide to end or continue things. Human feelings are complex the more you try to understand, the more you get confused."

dating,146p5jk,1686474583.0,Re-Entering the Dating Pool,"I am finding this whole dating thing a nightmare after coming out of a long marriage, you guys. 

I (35f) got married when I was very young to someone I met when I was even younger - and I was always something of a serial monogamist so I had limited experience of fuckboys. When I was in my late teens / early twenties the tacit rules of dating were that if things were casual then you never did couply things or talked about feelings or went below surface level. It felt very easy to navigate. 

Now it seems there‚Äôs a sort of hybrid model and it‚Äôs doing my head in. 

I recently met this guy and he was very communicative, eager in the beginning, we had a great connection and lot of fun. Four weeks in to us seeing each other in what was not even defined as dating at the time he out of nowhere said that he loved me and while I think I had some fond feelings at the time (in hindsight I think I‚Äôm trying to overcome three plus decades of people pleasing) I could have taken or left it at that point. 

So rewind back to my frame of reference of what saying I love you meant, was that things would begin to build and evolve. Not so, it seems in 2023. We had a conversation where we agreed that we were in fact dating, but that also apparently does not inherently mean exclusively. (Which I also don‚Äôt get, just from a time perspective how many people can you keep in your head at any one time really?)

From that point we still only saw each other sporadically and only when I would suggest it. He‚Äôs not the best in between communicator in terms of texting and so it feels very much out of sight out of mind. But he said the L word so I sort of allowed myself to get emotionally compromised. 

It‚Äôs been four months and I feel like we are stuck in this half in half out loop - when we‚Äôre together it‚Äôs certainly more than a casual no strings thing but there‚Äôs no impetus to move past it on his side. At this stage I would expect us to stop seeing other people, invest a bit more time to figure out if this has legs and if it doesn‚Äôt, move on.

So I guess I‚Äôm asking those if you who have been more in the scene if that‚Äôs normal? Do I have lots more of this in store? 

It used to be a guy would run for the hills if things even got remotely intimate or emotional but now it seems they want the girlfriend experience without the boyfriend obligations. 

TLDR; fuckboys say I love you now? How to sort the wheat from the chaff?",
dating,146ox4l,1686473767.0,Getting over a guy that hurt me. Advice?,"Earlier this year this guy I met at work was messaging me everyday and flirting goodnigjt good morning texts, he was picking me up and everything but not anymore. Yeah we rushed

Anyway it was already a fed flag from day 1 when a girl told me he sent the exact same thing to someone else ‚Äúsince my first day think your cute I‚Äôd like to get to know u‚Äù then friendzoned her and he didn‚Äôt even like her it lasted for 2 days, less than mine.   I learned about his disorder (bipolar) which has something to do with it. So I ignored it. 

Anyway it didn‚Äôt even last a monthüòÇ and I‚Äôm this upset about it because this is the first time a guy I met in person ever took interest in me and pursued me romantically.   I wasn‚Äôt even sure about him after the one date then the unexpected second (an unexpected one night stand lmfao) he was the first guy I ever kissed.  

I went home from our dates thinking ‚Äúhe‚Äôs so egotistical. Ew.  I like him but idk.  He‚Äôs my fling not my right guy.‚Äù   He said the same thing about me - he liked me but at the same time he doesn‚Äôt know.    Yet it‚Äôs been months and I‚Äôm still obsessing over him. Idk why. It‚Äôs an attachment, aye?

So anyways he ended it bsck then by telling me his disorder was acting up and had been crying all night. And we should stop talking because he‚Äôs unstable 

I avoided him at work from then on. I needed a real reason and messaged him, he told me it‚Äôs mostly
Mixed feelings about his ex - she cheated but he still needs to get her out of his head before he can speak to anyone else.   Which still gave me hope he‚Äôd come back around lol.   

I was upset. Then things got even worst when my bff joined our workplaxe - I was already thinking form day 1 I hope he doesn‚Äôt hit on my friend, because I get the feeling he has the habits of a playboy.  Then it actually happened. Lol. 

Another lady I work with told me she can tell I have a crush on him, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt give your heart to him. He‚Äôd make a great friend but relationship wise not so much.‚Äù She told me she asked him if he‚Äôs told me he‚Äôs not interested and she‚Äôs not sure if I picked up on it or not,    and told me he told her he told me about his breakup FROM A YEAR AGO.   He‚Äôs healing. Apparently he feels bad.   As if!

 Guy who complains his ex cheated on him with his bff, goes ahead and does this to me.  Then again the dudes a lot younger than  I am - I‚Äôm 23 and he JUST TURNED 20!  Idk what I‚Äôm hyping over. He‚Äôs literally a red flag and given me a few icks!  Why am I still liking him?!   He told me we‚Äôre young and he just wants to have fun -.- 

She told me she also told him that I‚Äôm so much prettier than my bff because she‚Äôs on my side.  The girls told me I can do so much better.   She called my friend a shtty friend because she‚Äôs flirts w him, asking to see his dog, joking around w him, moving two chairs away from me just to sit facing him at one point which pissed me off inside. 

She didn‚Äôt know I liked him, but even now that she‚Äôs knows I don‚Äôt see much difference.  She told me herself he was trying to make moves on her but ‚Äúhe can flirt all he once but I ain‚Äôt an easy girl. He‚Äôs not my type.‚Äù  Well u sure don‚Äôt act like it.  

Quite a few people have commented they think there‚Äôs something going on between them because when they talk together they never shut up back and forth and joking around. It used to upset me to watch. My friend ended up finding out and told me he‚Äôs not her type he‚Äôs not hers, and we call him mr walking red flag.  I told her some rude things he even said about her.  When she found out she told me herself she‚Äôd stay out of my personal business and him.  She doesn‚Äôt want to third wheel

It reminds me of her telling me back in school - there was a couple that were dating and she was close friends with the guy.  And the girlfriend would say to her ‚Äúcan u stop talking to hhim so much?  HES MINE!‚Äù Talking sht about how he‚Äôs just a close friend she doesn‚Äôt want him. But I can see where the girl was coming from. I know how it feels

So anyways 

I‚Äôve been out with them two times now and everytime I FEEL LIKE THE THIRD WHEEL. Last outting he lost his phone, I had his number so I asked I can call it for u but they didn‚Äôt hear me, my friend beat me to it and asked for his number to call it - and they saved each other‚Äôs numbers.  Which made me once again feel insecure. 

He would walk over and sit infront facing my friend everytime. I asked him at one point face to face if you‚Äôre not interested just tell me, don‚Äôt just keep unfollowing me over and over again. Which he told me ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt have to follow each other. We‚Äôre taking it slow.‚Äù - then changed to I see u as a friend 

Anyway the beef between us got even worst  after that recent outting with him and some other coworkers. He got drunk, then on the way home texted me he‚Äôs made it clear that he isn‚Äôt after anything with me - the one for him is Jenny‚Äù I asked which and he told me u know who the one we were with last night. 

I was so upset and angry at the same time.  I didn‚Äôt even realise I screamed at Jenny on the train until he told me she told him.  I asked her to message him that she isn‚Äôt interested and she did. She was sending him a long as message wishing him to get home safe - which I told her is a way of leading him on -.- 

The next week he apologised to us both for how he acted. That‚Äôs not the real him, he was drunk. 

I accepted his apology and felt at peace, until he had to comment ‚Äúwhat I said was true though.‚Äù  Which ruined the mood and made me angry.  I stood there for the remainder of work having to listen to the two of them joke around. I hate watching it. 

We‚Äôre supposed to go to a concert with him in a few months and I have the tickets. I sent it to him and told him i don‚Äôt want to go with him anymore. He already has guy friends to meet up with.   He said something along the lines of ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want to go w u anyways. I‚Äôve tried my best to be nice I don‚Äôt understand but if you‚Äôre going to be that way then fine. Don‚Äôt feel so cut just because I find Jenny prettier than you, and nicer.‚Äù     :(

I‚Äô have a reason to be rude to him after everything that‚Äôs gone on. I don‚Äôt want to talk to him anymore. But these feelings are still there idk why! I want to be over him 

Those words were like a stab in the heart.  From then on we now avoid each other and don‚Äôt even look at each other.  He‚Äôs also talks to Jenny less as well because it‚Äôs awkward, some coworkers have noticed why aren‚Äôt u guys talking. 

Jenny tells me she doesn‚Äôt care about him. She will go concert with me and the girls.  Deep down I have this feeling of anger towards both my so called bff and him.   

I kind of feel bad.  But at the same time I‚Äôm not apologising. I‚Äôm not taking to him. It‚Äôs awkward at work now 

He‚Äôs clearly not a good guy.   Advice on feeling happier and getting over him fast? :(","So you knew from the get go what kind of dude he was, yet you're hurt that you got the same treatment as all other women and that he didn't see you as something special?"
dating,146oq02,1686473023.0,Did I catch feelings?,"So my friend, Cameron and I (both F22) just finished college at Texas A&M and decided to move to Houston for our new jobs/ big girl apartment, etc.   
Bit of a backstory about me, never had a bf, only been on a couple of casual dates, and kissed a few guys at bars (never had a first kiss, so I did the desperate thing of kissing random guys at bars one time when I turned 20). That's the extent of my sex life or lack thereof.   
I had never been in a serious relationship before in my life (my strict Catholic parents and my wanting to focus on school). I didn't get attached to anyone on the dates as the idea of being in a relationship gave me anxiety at the time. The times I made out with the guys weren't a good experience for me and the only thing I tasted was bad breath and weed. We didn't even spend a lot of time talking before too. None of them were very attractive. I just didn't want to be that loser who hadn't kissed anyone by the time they turned 20.   
Shortly after moving into the new place, we spontaneously decide to go out to a club downtown. We were pretty drunk but we see this cute group of guys there. Cameron and I single two of them out (Peter, M23, and Alex, M25). Both were cute and I hit it off with Peter and Cam with Alex. They ditched their friend group and spent the rest of the night hanging out with us. Sometimes after a few more drinks and shots of cheap vodka, Peter made the move to kiss me and I have no clue what it was, but it felt good.   
Someone explain it to me- was it that I found him hot and he gave me attention or was it cause I was drunk asf or both?  
Story continues-  
Cam and I go home for the night and I immediately pass out on my bed. I woke up in my hungover haze to a text from Peter asking me if I was okay and if he wanted to go out with him that night to another club. I agree, happily and oddly confused as to why a guy that I didn't meet from a dating app is taking interest in me. The club was lame so we decided to go back to my place. I don't pick up on signals if guys want to have sex or not, seeming as I am a virgin and the most I've done is kissed a guy.   
But we cuddled, talked, and made out for a bit and I was so oblivious to the hints he was dropping that he wanted to go to my bed. I liked cuddling with him, I didn't know how to describe it but I clearly had never done it with a non-friend before. I was expecting him to get up and leave soon, but he never made an indication to. I mean it was thundering outside and I offered him our guest bedroom, but he insisted on sleeping on my bed with me. Again, never did that before with a guy.   
We just made out a bit and I guess I started getting anxious. I mean things were getting streamy and I  wasn't prepared for anything beyond making out. I did hint that I wanted to sleep at that point and we both did pass out.   
We talked more in the morning. He was clearly shocked at my lack of experience and I was shocked at his abundance of experience. He said he'd never try to pressure me to do anything sexual and would never have sex with someone right away with someone who had a lack of experience.  However, he did say that he wanted to hang out again before he took his Uber home to his place. We both were on the same page about keeping it casual because the idea of the relationship still scared me (and still does haha).   
And we didn't talk all week for some reason. I was actually hoping he would text me first. I clearly had never been in the position where will he text me back, but here I was. I know I could have easily texted him, but I didn't know if he even wanted to hang out again. I felt used in a sense.  
I did reach out eventually that Friday if he wanted to come out with Cam and I that weekend and he said he and Alex were actually having a small party and that we could come. Alex and Cam had been casually talking all week.   
The party was fun and Cam and Alex were all over each other. I thought it was kinda cute. I knew she really liked him. Peter and I did talk and I did get to meet more of their other friends too. However, I couldn't help but notice that Peter's phone had several messages from a girl on Tinder. It looked like an active conversation and I think they were planning on meeting up soon based on the gigantic font on his full-brightness phone.   
It didn't bother me and I guess what happened last week was a one-time thing. Cam ends up crashing with Alex. I hang back and talk with Peter and some other people at the party. Just as I'm about to call my Uber home, Peter convinces me to stay and insists he'll drop me off in the morning. All he says is that his bed is big enough for the both of us and we'd just be sleeping.   
I agree and know that Cam and I can leave home together in the morning. However, instead of sleeping, Peter and I begin making out. This is the first time anyone has ever kissed me on the neck or grabbed my boob and I liked the feeling? I'm new to all of this.  
He asked if we could do oral and I chickened out. He said last week he wouldn't have sex with someone right away if they were inexperienced, but maybe in the heat of the night, would we have ended up having sex? He was really into everything in terms of foreplay.   
Nothing exciting happened after that. We all got up and had breakfast in the morning before the guys dropped us off. Everything kind of fizzled out. Alex ghosted Cam after that night, even though he told her he was interested in dating her. He just stopped replying to her messages. As for Peter and me, we did end up running into each other at another small party the following week from a mutual friend I had met at Peter's party. We hardly talked that night but he was super friendly to me.   
A few weeks later, I texted him if he wanted to come out with me, Cam, and some friends. He said he was going out of state for a work thing that weekend. He never asked me to hang out again, though.   
And after that, nothing happened.... we didn't really speak again. No bad blood, just dried out I guess.   
And the part that fucks me up is this. Why does it bother me? Why do I keep replaying those nights in my head and keep wondering what would have happened had we had sex? I just felt so turned on for the week after and I couldn't do anything about it other than masturbate.   
Is it something I said or did that make things fizzle? Or did he want sex from the start and I just couldn't see that?   
My biggest question- why is this still on the back of my mind? Why can't I get over him or what happened? Why am I hopeful he will reach out again or we can rekindle this casual thing? I clearly deserve better but why can't I see that? Is this because this is the most male attention I have ever received in my life?",
dating,146opt6,1686473002.0,AITAH for still having feelings for my ex?,"It starts with my ex-boyfriend (A). We have been together for almost 4 years, and I love him so bad. We laugh, we kiss, and he shows me that he loves me too. But the problem is, I'm the one who comes into his house, and we stay there. In our whole relationship, we stayed only at his house. He never shows me to his friends or family.  
  
It's just like I'm stuck in his house.  
  
One time I asked him, ""Let's go outside and go to a restaurant like a date,"" and he agreed, but he told me, ""Not now, maybe next week. Which I understand. But the date has come. I've been waiting and waiting for him to invite me to go outside, but nothing has happened. Just because I love him so much, I understand him and move forward, not to mention the date again. but when the time comes, I feel bored for always being at home, and our routine is always the same. So I decided to break up with him even though I love him so much and know that he is not yet ready for commitment. I feel like we are just playing.  
  
As the years passed, I met my boyfriend (B). We are happy and have been together for 3 years, turning 4 this year. That's the opposite of my ex; he shows me his world. I know his friends, I know his family, we go outside every day off, and we bond together, but the problem is that I love him (and I do love him) but not like my ex. Still, my heart keeps staying on my ex, and I want to forget him so bad. for the sake of my boyfriend now.  
  
One time, I accidentally saw my ex in a coffee shop, and this is when my heart started beating fast. We talked again and laughed for a long time after not seeing each other, and I really missed him. He asked me if I had a boyfriend now, and I said yes. I saw his sad face, and he told me that he missed me. We finished our talk and exchanged contacts. Since this happened, I haven't told my boyfriend.

dating,146nnss,1686469122.0,The current dating climate is making me suicidal.,"Let me preface this by saying I (27M) don't have any issue with getting a woman. There's several women that regularly contact me (toxic people always have something up with their phone) to ""perform""... this issue is, that I can only get laid. 

I can't get a relationship for the life of me. I could do everything right, & genuinely keep my expectations low... then I'll just get ghosted. Yet like some sick twisted joke, i could walk up to a random woman in bar. Look her dead in the eye, & say something like, ""I guess I'd let you choke me."" ... then somehow I'll end up back at her place.

Yes,  I've been in plenty of relationships... All of which have ended within 3 months for one of 3 reasons: 

my disorders being too big of a concern (type 1 bi-polar, severe anxiety, ADHD, OCD, & manic depression)

I find out their a genuinely bad person 

 or  I get ghosted for being to easy.

To my first point; I get why my disorders can be too much, but I actively do A-LOT to reign everything in. People are always shocked that I'm mentally ill. I train MMA CONSTANTLY to maintain my endorphins, & then try to process negative emotions. I write everything from poetry, to long form stories... I even refuse to drink alcohol when I'm depressed, & monitor my nicotine consumption when I'm anxious/stressed.

The last two points go sort of hand in hand... I genuinely belive how you love speaks volumes about you as a person, down to your most fundamental morals. This sometimes makes women think I'm a doormat, & one of two things happen: Usually I notice a series of manipulative plays, & break things off. The inverse is that I get dumped for not giving her some kind of conflict.

The kicker in all of this is... I have an IQ of 130. I could easily play ""games"" with dating... the thing is: playing games with someone's emotions is sociopathic. Now these games are officially the standard of dating.

sure there's no motivation to being a ""good man"", but goodness dies with incentives. What's torturing me is that being s decent man just gets you hurt now. While toying with women has many incentives, and even more securities.

To top all this off, I'm a romantic. I love doing those little, or possibly grand gestures to show my love. Everything from a text with a line of poetry I just came up with, to making every woman on the dance floor jealous of my date... yet all of those romantics get me tossed aside. 

Normally with a rant like this, there's some a egregious flaw that the OP is entirely unaware of. For years now I was trying to figure out what my flaw was. 

That's where the real tragedy hits, I'm always getting calls/run ins from exes... They're always crying about how some other man treated them after me. They'll hit me with the entirety of toxicity in all these talks. However; I'm always clear that I'm never going back to someone who hurt me so... not like any of them would leave the new guy anyway.

Do you any of you have any idea what this is like? Trying to just be a good person, & be a good man to someone you love... but women would literally prefer to be getting abused by a guy less attractive, less wealthy, worse in bed, & has no personality nor morality.

One ex ghosted me after I guessed her favorite flowers on valentine's day, now her new bf is a bald douche who manages (but really steals all the income from) her OF... that HE talked HER into. Obviously I hope she gets into a better situation, but that's just out of baseline human decency.

Another ex dumped me after I basically wrote all of her essays her first year in college. The guy she left me for made her drop out, & now viciously beats her... she posts old memories of us together on her snap whenever they argue. I tried getting her in contact with certain services for women in those situations, but ultimately gave up on her when she started defending that scumbag. 

That's why I want to just end all of this... I'm at this twisted impasse. Either I give in, & become a horrible person... or I die alone.",Hey man I think you need to take a break from women for a while.

dating,146m3vr,1686463546.0,How do you guys move on from past relationship?,"Long story short, about 5 months ago, I found out my ex boyfriend has been cheating on me with his ex coworker. After we broke up, he kept saying it was his mistake, he realized that he wanted to be with me. But since he is in military and he was about to move to different country, he wanted to pursue the relationship with me once he comes back to states. And i was super closed to fall for it. One day, i had weird thoughts on my mind, and i decided to show up in our apartment ( i moved out right away when i found out he has been cheating on me). I saw different girl was in our apartment. I don‚Äôt know how i did it, i knocked the door. And it turned out she was one of his trainees (he was military basic training instructor at that time). So I reported them for inappropriate relationship. Past 5 months were hell. I was crying all day, lost quite some weights. Due to this awful break up, i went to see psychiatrist and therapist. I had experience with hallucinations due to side effects from one of the meds. All of these happened in 5 months.

dating,146m348,1686463475.0,(F19) possibly interested in (M28) and not sure what to think of it.,"I (M28) have a job working out in forests on old buildings and my company frequently partners with corps that have younger groups. I'm not the type of guy who goes out looking for younger women or anything (my last date was over 2 years ago, last real relationship 4 years ago. I'm very out of practice with all this stuff üòÇ). Anyway, we've been working with this crew and one of them (F19) I found out has a lot in common with me and we really hit it off. I didn't think anything of it until tonight when we were having a great conversation around the campfire. She mentioned how we should hang out outside of work, she wants our dogs to have a play date and listen to music (which she has amazing taste in). There was that ""hard to leave the conversation"" feeling that I think we were both having and we ended up staying up way later talking than either of us should be. I'm usually in bed by 8:30-9pm and we both stayed out till 10:30 after everyone else was in bed by 8. I find her attractive, but keep getting hung up on the age gap and the work situation (relations are prohibited, but people break that all the time). So I guess my question is how weird would it be if this went somewhere? Or what are people's experience with this? At this point in my life I'm looking for a serious relationship (not that I would expect one) and don't really care about hook ups and (as someone that used to be that age) I know things are very short term for younger people.

dating,146lzhr,1686463151.0,What is your definition of a ‚Äúcasual relationship‚Äù?,"I‚Äôd like to hear some responses. Ty for reading in advance, summary at the end. 

A few months ago I (28f) dated a guy (29m) who I wasn‚Äôt initially attracted to (a few inches shorter than his profile stated which is a tough cause I‚Äôm a tall. He‚Äôs not conventionally good looking but still very handsome in his way (he actually looks a little like Pedro pascal)). However, we ended up really getting along, and having a lot in common. I liked being with him and the almost 10 hr date ended with a few nonsex happy endings. He especially impressed me with his skills‚Ä¶. 

The issue is he was relatively recently out a 5year+toxic relationship. He also wasn‚Äôt jumping to pay for my meal but I think I was probably the first to say we can split it, cause I liked him. But after years of being taken advantage of by boys and past BFs I‚Äôm really looking for someone who likes me enough to want to pay for my $10 meal on a first date.

He wasn‚Äôt messaging me afterward, no effort, like I never existed. I reached out with a few texts and he finally answered a funny meme a made about wanting to have sex üôÑ I should have known. My profile was very clear about not wanting hookups and he even brought it up before we met. He answered me saying ~ I really like you but I‚Äôm not ready for anything serious but I‚Äôd really like to see you again but be ‚Äòcasual‚Äô. I responded saying thats no problem, I‚Äôve been single for almost 6 years dating around. Naively, I didn‚Äôt assume that meant casually effing other people, just not committing. 

Anyway, I invited him to my house for dinner, I love to cook and his kitchen was completely empty when I was over so I wanted to treat him to a good meal. I wasn‚Äôt expecting to have sex because I currently wasn‚Äôt on BC and had not had sex (by choice) in over a year üíÄ however he ended up doing his thing, came prepared and I caved. He slept over and we had a great night.

He once again ignored me, and I like to think I have ESP. I just KNEW he was went out with someone that next week. He then reached out to me for the first time just to talk. Sus behavior cause he felt guilty I think. I ended up telling him I‚Äôm not interested in someone who doesn‚Äôt like me enough to text back within a few days and he came back with how sorry he was cause he‚Äôs busy and he wanted to talk it out in person. When he came over he came clean about having sex with someone else and I somehow already knew. I had also still been on the apps and had a date lined up for that weekend. He was visibly jealous and I was disgusted. 

It just sucked like we both obviously liked each other we had some very intimate moments that felt a lot deeper than I‚Äôve ever felt. I joked ina text after he left ‚ÄúI guess we just didn‚Äôt have a spark‚Äù (I had given him a flint fire starter bracelet I bought for him because he camps every weekend, I love gift giving) and he responded, ‚ÄúI think the issue is there are sparks, and that complicates things.‚Äù I responded, ‚ÄúIt didn‚Äôt have to be complicated.‚Äù

We‚Äôve talked a little afterward only cause I reached out cause I‚Äôm totally crazy and finally I find a guy I actually like, and he‚Äôs not ready for a stable relationship. Which I totally get after healing for 6 years. 

Summary: Dated a guy who wasn‚Äôt ready for a relationship and wanted something casual. I had no problem with that, however the week after we commenced the ‚Äòsituationship‚Äô he had sex with someone else. So tell me, when you want a casual relationship, does that mean it‚Äôs open to casual sex with any other girl you date? Sorry for the long story. I have been mauling over this for like 3 months.","I'm a woman, but if someone tells me they want something casual I'm assuming they want to hang out sometimes and have sex and we're not exclusive. Due to this, I'm not going to put in much effort. I'll show up, talk a bit, have sex, and then I'm out. I'll text minimally in between hanging out."

dating,146l7gw,1686460462.0,I think ive turned into a penguin...,"What i actually mean is this. Apperently penguins only fall in love once. Ive been in love before but never like this before. The first few times were sudden and haphazardl. Spent most of my time fumbling through them before findingthe right answer and by then it was usually too late. 

Well fast forward to now. I have fallen extremely hard for not only my coworker but shes also one of my best friends. She gives me shit when i need it most. Keeps me in line and makes me think in ways ive never even imagined. Before her i had a fianc√© who turned into a monster as soon as i popped the question. I had never been at such a low point before in my life. Come to now. The one came into my life then. Helped me sort through all my bullshit. Saw my ugliness and still looked at me with loving eyes. A caring hand. I too helped her through horrible ugliness of her past ex. Then i turned into a jerk and pushed her away probably due to me being scared of losing her. And in that time. She found another guy who might actually be half decent but i havent met him yet and it honestly makes me physically ill to think about. 

I recently came clean to her and told her i was deeply sorry for how i was acting and how much she really means to me. How i want to spend the rest of my life with her. Her to annoy me and give me the little love punches she would do. I bought a promise ring and showed it to her to prove to her my seriousness of how deeply i love her and want a life with her.

Now shes the type to take a long time to decide on things. She has said to me that she always has something going on. And multiple people have said that to her in the past. I told her that i understand and that i would wait patiently for her answer. 

Me and her have been fwbs in the past to help eachother and to get over our exs. But in the meantime. We also fostered an incredible friendship. She still likes me i because she told me. And that she in the past wanted to pursue a relationship with me. I just so happened to do it about 4 months later when she told me about the new guy. My whole world began to shatter. I could barely eat anything for the following week and been that way since basically. 

I want to do everything in life with her. I want the fights. I want the crying. I want the laughter. I want the love. I want kids with her. I am so willing to give everything to her, all i need is for her to say yes and accept me. The only problem is that its hard as hell to sit and wait for an answer from her. Especiallysince she is still probably talking with the other guy. 

What do i do ? I bet everything on her. She is my soulmate. I can say it with utmost certianty because ive never met another girl like her and not any other girl has come even close to her in any way in my eyes. Ive tried going on dates. Ive tried doing nothing. Ive tried forgetting about her and my mind is never far from thinking about her. Never far from some way of how to be better for her. Never far from thinking on how to make her laugh. Or smile. Or to even brighten her day a little.",

How do I handle this in the best way?,"For the past 2 years that we've been together, I've always had a feeling of being unsure. I love this person, I love being around this person, I love the times we've had together. But deep down I've always known that they weren't the one. Our incompatibilities have been glaringly obvious and this decision has felt like it's been building up. From our sex life, our world views, our morality, our humor, our goals for our future, our everything has felt like a challenge. We get a lot from each other, but I just can not see myself with this person for the rest of my life. So I think it's best for the both of us to not drag this out. 

Here's my problem: When I met my GF, she was extremely immature and generally inexperienced with life as a whole: She didn't know how to be a independent functioning adult. I've spent the past 2 years teaching her and growing with her and now we have an apartment together for the next 10 months, which neither of us could afford alone. She has major issues with her family and constantly tells me how happy she is to live with me and away from them. She has tremendous abandonment issues and severe trauma. And not to speak poorly of her, but with her ADHD and potential autism (it's obvious, just not diagnosed) she has difficulty with simple tasks of life. Together we relearned what relationships should be and I've provided a safe place emotionally/sexually/physically. To leave all of that is really really difficult. So I need to find the best way to help her stay on her feet and continue on her path without me. 

I love her to death, but I can no longer be with her. Where do I start?",You can start by not starting

dating,146l1ok,1686459907.0,Why the girls I used to date were all about upseting me when I saw them again in public?,"Didn't know where to vent. It's going to be a bit long but I'll keep my best to be short lol It is the weirdest thing that happened to me this year.

3 years ago, I used to date this girl from university(let's call her S). She lovebombed me at first and I fell for it really bad. We used to hangout and kiss and cuddle but then she would play the hot n cold. She checked all the boxes of being a narc. After a couple of months of uncertain dating, she discarded me out of blue and telling me lots of bad stuff. I found out she had returned back with her ex. It took me a lot of time to recover as everything was ruined. My self esteem, feeling blue all the time, and very bad thoughts. But I moved on nonetheless, learned a lesson and ingored her for the rest of the year.

When I got better, I met a girl at a movie event(let's call her G). Everything was going nice and dating every day. She told me she had an abusive past and wanted to take things slow. I said no problem and see where it goes without getting too attached. After a couple of weeks she began to play hot and cold and play mind games. I spoke with her that I didn't liked it and it's better to stop dating if she behaves like that. She got mad. But still tried to contact me. I sent her a final message and told her to leave me alone.

Then last year I went for a hiking 3-day trip with a group of people on the internet. When I arrived at the bus that was going to transport us, I saw S too. Still ignored. I met a nice girl during the trip and shared a few moments. S got in the middle, befriended her and was doing her best to sabotage us. She would come and knock on my hotel room's door and tell me how sorry she was. The more I ignored her the worst it got. The new girl I met just told me that she didn't want any drama and didn't talk to me again. So I said to myself to hell with it and met with S. We spent the last night together in my room and had sex. When we got back, she became too clingy and needy. She was lovebombing me all over again. Acting all nice and telling me to accept her back in my life and yadda yadda. Then she told me she was going away for a month and wait for her and not to fool around. Which was a lie because I already knew from a mutual friend that she was going away start a job with a 1 year contract. I still had some anger from the first encounter and waited for her to leave the town. I didn't want to end it face to face because I knew how crazy she would get and try to revenge. I made sure she reached on the other side of the world and called her and told her to cut every form of contact because I didn't like anything about it. And I just ghosted her, until she stopped texting me for days and gave up.

A few weeks went. I was walking down the street when I saw G right in front of me. She stopped me and hugged me. I was confused. Then she asked me for a coffe. Again, I said to myself to hell with it. We had a long conversation and she told me that she wanted to date again, but this time in a serious way. I agreed but didn't trust her. We had sex and we both enjoyed. The more times we had sex, the more she would become clingy and overracting on everything. But I could see with my eyes closed that it was all an act. I could tell that she was not only unstable but also dating other people. But still I wanted to get physical with her and do my own act. Then she blocked me out of blue. We didn't had any fight and we didn't had any slight disagreement. I laughed it off and went with my day forgetting the whole situation with her.

Forward to this week. I had been in a trip to Africa and went to Egypt to get to my plane and return back home in Europe. Out of every single country in the world, I saw S at the passport check queue at the airport. Once she saw me(we were 2m close in the line). She was with a group of friends and once she saw me she became furious. She was trash talking out loud and making sure I could hear. And making fun of me in a subtle way. She even started to talk with every other guy around and flirt with them. I was holding back my laughter because of how pathetic she looked like. But still made it through.

Today I went with a couple of my friends at a bar. Guess who was there. G! Once she saw me there, she started to talk to every other guy on the bar. She even tried to flirt with my friends but was unsuccessful. Than she tried to catch my attention but I was ignoring her all along. She came right next to me and told me that I was a bad person for not trying to reach to her, and that blocking me was to test me. I laughed and told her I dodged a bullet there and she did me a favor there. Oh boy, her face turned red and was fuming and mumbling. Then she left in a hurry.

So far it is been a really confusing week. Don't know what to expect anymore. But still I don't understand their behavior and why they had so much anger for me when they were the first to try and play me. Maybe they got hurt for not doing whatever fucked up scheme and manipulate me. But still after all this time it feels quite bizarre. My friends told me that I'm the problem for dealing with these kind of girls. And I feel bad right now for going through them again. I just want to erase them from my past like I've never met them.

Tl;dr: Dated two girls on two different periods of time each. Got discarded and ghosted, and did the same. During this week, I was in the same place with them by coincidence. And they acted in public trying to make me upset and whatnot.",

dating,146kv9b,1686459312.0,"Feeling a bit lost, would appreciate some advice.","Hello all, this is my first time posting here, not entirely sure what to expect.

To start, some background about me. I am a male that is currently 18 and going into my second year of college. 

Starting from about a year and half ago, I have been on a major self improvement journey. Complete diet, fitness, emotional, and mental reformation. I feel I have a very good physique, style, and I feel very well read. I am also on an entrepreneurial mission to build a product as well. 

The beginning of some of these changes were to build myself into the man I want to be, but also the man that women would want.

I have been in several relationships before, but recently it's been pretty dry, and I haven't had a solid actual partner in about 9 months.

The problem is that I feel extremely lonely romantically. I have friends that I consider to be brothers, family that I can rely on, but I long for something more.

A main challenge is that my college is a tech school that is 66% male, and most of the women there are unavailable, making things challenging. 

My main question is just where do I find women exactly? I have tried dating apps to no avail, most of the experiences from that feel shallow and the whole process feels disgusting. I also feel that most women rarely use those services anyway. I want something real and at least somewhat long term.

I would also like to find a way to practice building confidence in some form, as I think it needs work.

Any help/advice would be appreciated.",

dating,146kp6f,1686458741.0,[UPDATE] I dislike everyone around me because they're annoying.,"Hi again, I don't really remember how long ago I posted my last part to this but I know it was recent. Please stick with me and don't judge my writing because English is not my first language. I also have to post this in a different category (sorry I don't use reddit often)

So it's been awhile and I guess I really am indecisive. Yeah my friends are hella annoying and I really don't like them, but I don't think I'm aromantic. I think I like C again and I don't know how to tell R. I don't even know IF I SHOULD tell R. Last time I told R about my feelings everything got really awkward. What I didn't include last time is that after I told R I liked C a few days went past before I said I didn't like C, and in that timeframe was the most terribly awkward situations. R is one of those people who really like, I think it's called MLM? But R fetishizes gay people, mainly men. Both me and C are men. I think the main reason I lost interest in C at the first point was because the continuous subtle jokes from R about me and C giving each other sexual pleasure. Example, if I lend C a pencil because he didn't have one R would speak up and be like ""oh just give each other head at this point"" ??? 
I really do think they are annoying but I don't want to leave R or C. (Plus I'm kinda into C again, I'll explain later)
During one of those days R ""subtly"" asked me if I wanted them to push me into C and I'd land on top of him. (This isn't some fantasy, that would hurt.) I obviously told them no, and that ""that was a stupid idea"" but they just giggled it off. I eventually got really tired of it and just decided to force my feelings away. (you'd know if you tried it doesn't work all that well, so they've always been lingering) I tell R something along the lines of ""hey can we tell C that the secret I was keeping was I was Inlove with his mom. (Mom jokes)"". Because prior, ask another joke, R said I had a secret about C TO HIS FACE!! not cool. R obviously agrees after I tell them I think I'm aromantic. (I'm not, I just thought I was) after that R is like, ""oh I don't like C either, I'm going to go after the senior instead.) R is 15, Senior is basically and adult. Weird but okay. Let's call the senior S. S was also into R at the time but didn't act on it. S also made a joke about kts so often, I then R and S would fit because they are both stupid. But R has been with my so long, I don't want to abandon them. So stupid of me I know, but I just can't bring myself to.
Anyways, explaining how I caught feelings for C again. So after me and R broke up we really didn't talk to much to each other online unless it was for advice or important stuff, so I've talked to C way more then any other of my friends. C is cool, he's really pretty and has amazing music taste, he's introverted which I hate but I can be an extrovert for him, it's whatever. I've always been a little nervous to tell him how I feel because he's intimidating. Imagine a 5'4 guy with too many piercings, bleach blond hair, and very ""punk"" like clothing. Me and him are kind of opposites in style. I really wear baggy pants and shirt and then a huge jacket to top it off. I'm pretty basic but I'd like to think I look nice. C is very honest and shares at of interests with me, except a few (like gaming, who doesn't like to game?! He plays the sims 4 only really. {I forced myself to play that game and like it to relate to him}) we always talk well and really never run out of stuff to talk about. He doesn't really like dark humor so I've been stopping using a lot of that, but he lets it slide when I make a racist joke about my own race (I'm Hispanic). Sometimes we jokingly flirt and used flirting emojis like ""üòòüò≥üòèüòçüòô"" but I know he means it as a joke. Back when I was around early 14 me and R were together (we are poly) we would make jokes about us both marrying him, but he'd always deny and say he was with our parents and don't want to break their hearts. (Okay weirdo??) But I recently found out he's reread those conversations over and over a lot of times, so I'm think I either maybe have a chance, or he ignored what I told him about R and fell inlove with them. But then again I don't think I have a chance because I really don't know how to express myself and I say ""I hate you"" or ""kys"" or ""die"" to him a lot. He's really the only other person I talk to other then my mom. guys I don't know what to do, I forced my feelings for R so this is my first time every really liking someone. I'm kind of nervous, and I feel like I don't have a chance at all. I know I'll never know until I try but we've all already made plans for the future and if I ask him out and he rejects me we'd either give those plans up or awkwardly stick together, remembering that time I confessed. This isn't really me asking for advice but it's me trying to get this off my chest. I don't know if I should tell R or what. I feel like I can trust them even though how they reacted the first time. I know they'd make this awkward again but I just want to tell someone, this is eating me alive.",
dating,146kfhd,1686457855.0,"Getting frustrated with being single, would love to read your success stories",Would love to hear your story about how you meet your partner and any details/advice that would help someone who is growing impatient with being single,"Hey! I serial dated throughout my teenage years and into University. It broke me completely, as I felt empty and alone by the end of a series of unhealthy nights- everything was transactional and there was no empathy, honesty, tenderness, or care. 
Then, I snapped out of it; I stopped giving myself away to people that did not know me or deserve me. I figured out my wants and needs, then found someone who could fulfil them: handsome, kind, charming, humorous, lively, reserved when necessary, aligned with politics, a romantic, respectful, charismatic, kitschy, and SOOO much more!! 

1. Stop living for other people, as it will hijack your anticipatory thoughts and emotions. Find your own path in life: you are allowed to be selfish, do not anyone anything emotionally, and entitled to explorative years through singularity. 
2. Find a community and engage with it. EX: political activism, internships, spirituality (yoga, church, etc.), schools, professors, counsellors, physicians, mentors, family dinners, etc.
Note: be cautious about telling friends and family members about certain dreams and ambitions, as they may be jealous, insecure, or downright cruel about it. As an immediate result of, they may attempt to derail your progress- this is a symptom of their insecurity, not yours.
IMPORTANT: you will typically find a partner by doing things you love and value. I met my boyfriend in a German lecture. We sat next to each other every day for an entire semester; we were strictly friends for six months before considering a date.
What do you love? Is it running? Great! Join a run club and train with a group‚Ä¶ you may meet someone your own age. 
3. Love yourself before you give love to someone else. As my mother always said, ‚Äúcheck yourself before you wreck yourself‚Äù; as my father always said, ‚Äúbecome the person you want to date, then the match will follow‚Äù. 
4. Proper exercise, nutrition, and sleep hygiene. Seriously. Do not get sloppy with this. Take care of yourself, please.
5. Replace social media with books and make a goal of reading one book per week. What is your screen time? Exactly. Replace it by reading something you take an interest in. 
6. Stop using people for validation or gratification. If they give you a compliment, then accept it with grace and gratitude.
7. Dress sharp! Are you male? Great, women love jeans and polos- something suave that makes you appear confident (even if you aren‚Äôt). Are you a female? Great, males love women in dresses with dainty jewelry. 
Overall: dress for yourself, but also know that you need to be appeasing a certain gaze to find success. Traditionally, males and females are looking for someone with a classical, elegant, refined look."

We decided we were going to watch the NBA final (his team lost btw).

He asked me to make out after the first commercial. I said no. I also said I would give him 1 kiss but I literally chickened out saying his breath smelt like whisky. By the 2nd half he wanted to go into his bedroom. I said no. Then I left. To his credit he was nice and understanding.

It got me thinking‚Ä¶ wow I really am the kind of girl who can‚Äôt put her mouth on a boy who she really doesn‚Äôt like. I could have kissed him but he also didn‚Äôt contribute. I ended up feeling queezy. Someone please tell me I‚Äôll feel better w a man one day!","If it helps. You shouldn't consider that a date. It was an attempted hook-up from his end. Also...

Wow you are brave. I know it sucks to think this way. But so much could have happened going to a man's house that you've never dated yet üò¨.

I'm glad you are safe. That you didn't just do what he said. But you should just remove that night from your mind. Block him. And start fresh. GL out there and stay safe."

Before then I was so involved with school and work and also quite content with the love I received from my friends. When I started dating guys I always thought my heart, personality, interests/hobbies, and pretty decent looks would be enough. But it doesn't appear to be, I find men even those my age have lived so much and have been to so many places and dated so many people and here I am feeling like a child. I never really left home commuted for college and just live humbly, I guess dating made me realize how mundane I am. Don't get me wrong I could talk about anything for hours and I've accomplished a lot in academics and my field (I work in mental health with the elderly) and am very passionate about it. But I just can't help but feel it's not enough, am I missing something?","although everyone moves forward at their own pace, its unfortunate you are unable to find it relatable from those around you. others simply focused on a different path than yours, theres nothing wrong with you and you arent alone. you sound quite successful with all that you have accomplished with your career, you are anything but mundane. you still have the luxury of catching up, just keep moving forward. continuing to compare your journey and experiences with others will hold you back and doubt yourself."

dating,146idn0,1686451241.0,Why do people throw so much negativity at guys that vent about woman in the dating scene?,"Something I‚Äôve come to learn growing up is that if you‚Äôre a man well then the world just does not care about you or you‚Äôre problems. You could‚Äôve have risked your life for someone else and if you see in need you will be brushed aside . 

This is especially true with woman when it come to dating. I know ima get backlash for this but I don‚Äôt care ban me if you want. But let‚Äôs be realistic dating heavily favors woman to begin with I mean a great modern example of this is dating apps.

Dating apps overwhelmingly favor, women that‚Äôs just a fact and that mirrors are real life everyday lives. You‚Äôll certainly have more of a chance With a girl in real life rather than on a dating app but you‚Äôre still fighting at a disadvantage.

I also think modern modern feminism is pushing a very toxic view of men to women, all this to say this is also heavily affecting the dating scene as well.

But my big problem is whenever I see this stuff talked about or called out or see any type of criticism directed towards woman in regards to those subjected . I see either a whole lot of men of all things attacking other men or woman just gaslighting these men into think men are just the problem deflecting any type of criticism and offering nothing to the conversation .

Funny enough guess who is taking The most vocal stand against this type of behavior? Yup other women the girls are standing up for the guys and it does make sense this effects them too.

From the day I left we had daily contact and he was calling me , also texts and it felt like mutual interest.  During the period I met him on my holidays I felt a genuine connection and a very strong attraction,  that I dont feel so often like this. During these holidays I met other 2 guys also but I didn't do anything with them , but one of the 2 was leaving romantic comments on my pics even though we didn't do anything . When I left, Mohamed was telling me to not talk to other guys,  not show my body and things like this..One morning and a few days after I left and I was at home , we were talking videocall , in the beginning we were casually talking but later on I started talking sexy to him and asked him what is he wearing right now and requested him to show me and things like this... I proceeded on taking off  my clothes and we made sexy videocall with mutual masturbation and he came in the end..

After,   the rest of the day he didn't text me anything which I found weird,  but I thought maybe its ok since we were talking for an hour in the morning.  I texted him good night,  I love you , we talk tomorrow and he didn't reply to me . I know he works until midnight and after midnight a lot of times because I was there and I saw it in my eyes while I was there..So I thought it was because he works.  But a bit later I saw he uploaded an Instagram story , so I started feeling concerned but again didn't put any pressure. 

I waited the next day , he wasn't connected until 18.00 pm when I texted him something because I was feeling pretty dissapointed with him. I just told him that real men don't dissappear like this and keep their word, also if he doesn't talk to me other men will.  Then I said that I felt he was different but he wasn't and i should have understand it when he had me waiting until 3 am because he was working ( I was there) and had me there waiting , but he could postpone some appointments since it's his own business. And i also said that this world is full of fuckers,  but the one who ultimately stays in your mind and heart is the man with feelings and respect. He then replied that he understood that I only wanted him for sex and not for who he is as a person or his personality which is not true . I said that this isn't true and I felt a genuine connection. I asked him what happened and his behavior suddenly changed and if he met someone else.  He said that he knows where I can find him and if I come he will welcome me . I replied that I will not come because I didn't see him only for sex and I was feeling pretty sad because I also tried to call him and didn't pick up. Also I said that if he was interested he would have offered to pay at least half of the tickets.  He replied he doesn't pay for anyone to visit him. I was feeling very sad and shocked with his cold behavior so in the end I texted him "" I hope you don't have any STD because one of the times we had sex I took you without condom"". And then I also told him that my last day in Cairo I met the most gorgeous man I've ever seen in my life and if I come again  will come for him and told him "" thank you for helping me choosing correctly,  it was a big relief""... Then blocked him . 

I think maybe my treatment was bad but I felt sad and ignored and then the way he replied to me that I only wanted him for sex, wasn't true. And he became cold to me out of the blue . Should I unblock him and talk to him again, maybe apologize or I behaved correctly? Somehow I feel bad inside and really miss him and honestly I wanted to make this trip to meet him again but he broke my heart .

I wait your replies,  thank you !",If a man wants someone he wouldn‚Äôt let her leave if he loves her he will definitely not be cold with her and will reply to her shortly he is making you feel guilty so you could leave and not to bother him by the right way he used your emotions just don‚Äôt look back and try to be with a real man

dating,146ho5d,1686449023.0,THE TEN CHARACTERISTICS - WHAT WOMEN FIND ATTRACTIVE,"
Here is a bit about me; I love reading and observing. I have male cousins and friends who struggled with women and others who attracted them like magnets. I found this fine line fascinating. I value understanding myself and what makes us women ""click."" I believe a man and a woman need to develop a conscious understanding of what they find attractive in a sexual partner. What makes a man or a woman attractive, and what are the characteristics we seek in our perfect mate.

Following quite a bit of studying I list here a top 10 list of what women find attractive in a man. This is not all my content but I have borrowed heavily by anonymous authors in various blogs principles that resonated with me. 

(1) Appearance
It doesn‚Äôt matter how good your genes are, no matter how tall, small, fat, thin, bald, or white you are, you can always be successful with women. Most of the greatest womanisers that ever lived would never have won a beauty pageant; they simply did the most with what they were born with. You don‚Äôt have to be the prettiest guy, but you have to take care of yourself. Practice confident body language and create an interesting look a woman would want to find out more about. Be well groomed, shower regularly, have clean nails, shave, no weird beard, no neck hair, maintain white teeth, get a natural tan, workout at the gym, eat nutritious food, and do something for your physical health every day. 

(2) Adaptability
Ladies love a guy who is exciting to be around because he is adventurous, enjoys trying different things out, and handles new situations well. Adaptability is about being independent, spontaneous, and risk taking. Move forward with confidence and know that you are best prepared for anything that could happen. Don‚Äôt cling to the wellbeing and comfort of your shell. Try out new things every year, find out about the things that interest you, brea out of bad habits (I am not one of them). Travel more, get exposure to new situations, approach any women you find attractive and enjoy the journey you are on.

(3) Texture, Mystery, and Boundaries
Become a man of depth and mystery by not being too predicable nor too available, have texture, different sides, show that you have a life going on and that you have many options. Set yourself a strong personal boundary that is able to open up but always keep a part of yourself off limit, private and unreachable to other people. 

(4) Communication
An attractive man is able to communicate and present a masculine, charming, mature energy. He is able to sexually excite women, to touch them on an emotional level by carrying himself with total confidence and a playful cockiness. Learn how to flirt and how to control the underlying meaning of an interaction by setting yourself up as the prize. Show a woman that she has no sexual power over you, this makes YOU her best opportunity and challenge to get validation. Show that you have a well developed sense of humour, don‚Äôt take anything too serious in the interaction.

(5) Connection
A man must be able to demonstrate to a women that she can trust him and be comfortable around him. Showing understanding and empathy are fundamental to build a deeper connection. For this you have to posses a genuine desire and interest in other people. It‚Äôs not about trying to be interesting, but being curious and finding out what truly interests you and her.One of the most attractive qualities about a man is the ability to expose vulnerability at times and still not care what other people think.Many men try to build a connection right away, without having created any kind of attraction. She needs to earn your trust first before you start to create a deeper connection with her.

(6) Positivity
Nobody wants to be around negative people who whine and complain all the time. We want to be surrounded by people who make us feel good, who have positive energy, who know how to have fun and enjoy life. It is fundamental that you develop a positive belief system because reality is only what you believe it is. Allow, encourage and enjoy when others shine and progress. Meditate regularly, talk positively to yourself, and discover other tools to bring positivity in your life.

(7) Purpose
Believe it or not, but it doesn't matter how much money you have. What women really love is a guy that has ambitions and goals in life, who goes for his dreams and lives purposefully. Be a man who knows who he is, what he wants, and is unstoppable. Always come from a place of being determined to do what works. Know where you are going and stay on this course no matter how mislead other people are. Create a plan and think through future events with discipline, take action to create change and pursue your decisions with all aspiration. Show women that you have something going on besides them. Always remember that you have complete control and responsibility over your life.

(8) Strength
Strength is about stability, certainty and reliance, or anything that gives a woman the feeling to be safe around you. It is about having a strong frame and dictating your own standards based on your beliefs, values, and principles. Become a pillar of strength, security, and protection in every situation. Have your own rules, don't accept bad behaviour, don't change your opinion for someone else, don't be scared to lose a woman and display the willingness to walk away at any time. Learn to say no. Women love a guy who is dominant (but not dominating), who is decisive, takes charge and leads; who says where to go, what to do, and when to end.Take responsibility in every situation and decide to be the leader.

(9) Social Value
It relates to your community acceptance and how other people are reacting towards you.From an evolutionary perspective this demonstrates to a woman that a man is able to secure her survival and take care of her offspring through the support of a tribe or network of followers. I admint this is a rather elusive concept to me.

(10) Self Esteem
is probably the most important characteristic, because how you see yourself is how you experience life. Learn to feel competent to handle the challenges of life and be worthy of everything that is good. Women look for a guy that is an independent self sufficient entity. Forgive yourself for the mistakes you did in the past and accept that we are only human.",Reading this while depressed is just a gut punch lol
dating,146hnxg,1686449000.0,Do I engage him after he left me for another girl,"I met this guy on a dating app. I matched with him and shared a few lines of hi hello etc before I went off the app for a few months (because I hate it and get disappointed and just stop opening the app) . When I log back in I see he had messaged me and I apologized and explained and ask him out for coffee. The date goes pretty well and he asks me if I'm dating other people since he doesn't believe in multiple dating. I say I am going out on dates but nothing has stuck yet. Since then he pursues me for 2 weeks, setting up dates every other day, messaging in between etc. By now I kinda really really like this guy and I've stopped going out on other dates altogether. Then we have the talk and everything goes south. He doesn't seem as into this as I expected, and after acting distant for a few days mentions he's been seeing another girl that he likes and he wants to give that a fair chance and he didn't feel right not telling me about it. I'm devastated but I wish him luck and agree to casually hangout. 2 months later he texts me now to mention he wants to give us a chance if I still like him. I have refrained from asking him about the other girl because I just didn't want to know. Should I even engage him in this conversation? Or just say no. I can't help feeling like the 2nd choice here.","Honestly, if you enjoyed dating him, give him another chance. He hasn‚Äôt really done anything wrong. This is all a part of dating. In fact, he was honest with you at the end of the day instead of ghosting you which is pretty respectable. You‚Äôre right not to ask about the other girl because it is none of your business and will only make you feel some type of way that you probably shouldn‚Äôt be feeling."

Before you start preaching to me about how I should give short men a chance, and I‚Äôm being too superficial, I‚Äôve dated guys my height (and shorter) and it just doesn‚Äôt work for me. That being said, I feel so chastised when I ask a guy his height.   They automatically get offended if they are shorter, but I literally put it in my profile how tall I am, and that he must be taller.

All of your comments gave me a lot to think about. For some context, I was going to meet up with a woman for a date, but she was demanding to know my height before agreeing.

Long story short, I did confirm with her and she acknowledged that she would be unwilling to meet with guys under 5 ft 10. It hurts to know that if I was shorter she wouldnt even be willing to meet up with me. And as a tall guy, I will NOT be valued solely for my height. I am a human being, not an object.

dating,146h25d,1686447151.0,dating with intimacy issues has changed my opinion of myself even though I know it shouldnt,"I'm 22 and my end goal has always been to find someone who is willing to commit to me. I also have a lot of guilt around sex being tied to my worth since I grew up with these ideologies in catholic school. However, the past year I moved out for my final year of university I met a guy who I hoped to date, but it became clear pretty early on he was just looking for sex so we became fwb for a few months. I'm aware I did make a mistake engaging in it when I knew I had feelings, but the chemistry was great and he carried himself and spoke like casual hookups were the norm for him and hadnt been in a relationship since high school. So I figured fuck it, why not, sex should be fun and shame free and I enjoy it, why shouldnt I have fun while I have the chance! At the time, I did

He amicably ended things with me end of april because we graduated and dont live in the same city anymore, which was the right decision but hard because my feelings were still there. Now, I find out through social media that he has a girlfriend, and its just brought back all the old negative feelings I had about myself and sex. If he can get into a relationship this easy, what is it about me that makes me only worthy of sex? or is it that I was wrong to give it up so soon and chose my own fate at a place holder until he found someone better than me? i've just been looking down on myself and seeing myself as so inadequate, even though I know I'm not any less of a person for enjoying sex. its just hard to have a high self esteem when this has triggered me so much. going forward I know casual sex is a no for me, but how do I deal with these emotions and navigating dating againn now?",
dating,146h0e7,1686447010.0,Who's lonely? This guy üòé,"Gonna just keep this short and simple for the same of all of us here. Also, don't expect much structure to this post either. Typing off the top of my head here. 

I feel overwhelmingly lonely anytime I start thinking about relationships. I'm only 20 and I recently finished my first year of college classes.  I've been very close to being in an actual relationship twice in my life but it suddenly stopped both times right when it seemed like we were actually getting somewhere. I never got a good reason as to why things didn't work out in either situation. 

I'd love to try and meet new people but I feel like it could be a waste of time mainly because I don't feel like I'm anywhere near cut out to be in a relationship. Let's learn why üßö‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è:

-I currently live with my father and grandparents in a sad little attempt to save at least some money while taking classes. Financially, I'm grateful for my living situation. Aside from that, I don't really like it here all too much. I never have anyone over because this house isn't exactly up to par with my standards that I had from my previous house. Makes me sound like a prick but it's true and it's something that I struggle with. 
-My hobbies are that of your typical 20 year old guy. I play video games, card games, I workout semi regularly, and I really enjoy my car. That's about it. I work 20-30 hours a week. I don't party or do any other social activities that would promote meeting new people. I hang out with some of my friends from high school when I can but we don't really go out to do things. We typically just pick someone's house and chill there for the evening. I just don't do interesting things. I bored the last girl I was talking to beyond belief. 
-I feel like I'm extremely emotionally unavailable. Physical touch and any sort of intimacy weirds me out for reasons that don't matter all too much for this post (thx mom). In my previous encounters, I was always ridiculously hesitant to ""make a move"" because I legit just don't know what it right and when to do it. In other words, I have zero game when I'm attracted to someone. Don't get me wrong though. I 100% crave even just the most basic forms of human touch. I get a hug from one of my gal friends every couple months but that's it. Nothing more. 

I could complain more about why I think attempting to rope literally anyone into trying to start a relationship with me, but I think you get the point. I'll go over some of my pros real quick I guess? 

-I'm fairly attractive according to all of my friends. I agree mostly agree with them so there's that. Love some confidence right? üíÄ
-I'm not a complete buffoon in terms of intellect. I'm not a genius by any means but I'm fully aware that I do and think about things differently than the general public. I feel like this is one of the big reasons I'm struggling with all of this so much. 
-I genuinely feel like I'm a pretty decent guy all around. I don't feel like I have any craaazy red flags aside from what has already been stated. 

That's it I guess. This was supposed to be short but oh well. Advice would be cool but I know what the general answers will be. Just posting this hoping that someone might say something that I haven't heard before. Just some general support would be cool. If you made it this far, thanks for reading.",
dating,146gwmv,1686446696.0,Just a vent about a party I (38M) attended that turned into an introspection about how I perceive myself,"This post is just for venting and it's very loosely related to this sub.   
There won't be a TLDR because this post doesn't call for any comment, it's just a small contribution about a personal experience.

I went to a party yesterday, met with friends and made new friends. Around 4 AM most people were long gone but the 6 remaining of us (4 M, 2 F) then went to someone else's place to hang out. I was tired so I initially thought I'd go for a few minutes but ended up staying for over 5 hours.   
We were initially all a bit tipsy and my group of friends started taking ecstasy. I never tried but drugs are not really my thing so I didn't take any. We didn't consume alcohol during that ""after party"".   
We talked for hours about pretty much anything and everything. We eventually talked about what we thought about each others, the positive and the negative.   
I come from a small and rather isolated island with a population of less than 300k, it's a mainly conservative place, I moved to Canada over 12 years ago. I came to realize I have never had this kind of conversations with anyone before, either with friends in my home country or in my new country of residence.

What these people told me tore me apart, in a good way. I'm crying just writing these words.   
Some of them I've known for years, some for a few months, some I just met that night. The take aways are I'm a great guy, I lighten any place or group of people I come in contact with, I'm smart, interesting, funny, I have deep and meaningful conversations. One of them told me he wishes to become more like me. On the downsides, which I'm already more than aware of, I'm shy, I'm too modest, I need to open up faster (I do open up but it usually takes time for me to know the people and feel safe with them before I do). One of the 2 women present at that time told the other, her best friend, that it's me she should be dating. I find it flattering that the same woman, whom by her own account dislikes most men and can hardly engage in conversations with most of them told me she liked and even wants to take me on a ""date"" (my own word, she wants to have a drink with me someday). Note that she's a lesbian and currently in a relationship so it'll be nothing more than a friendly ""date"".

By their own account, the drugs they took were very light and they barely had a feel-good mood. The ones I've known for a long time did not display an altered behavior so I tend to believe this. For the people I knew from before, some of the things they told me, they already told me while sober so the drugs clearly did not alter their minds too much.

The things they told me affected me tremendously because I've felt like a human piece of crap, unworthy of romantic love for most of my life. I'm a 38 years old virgin (that, only 2 of my closest friends back home know about, and now you do as well) and I've been dealing with below 0 self-esteem and confidence all my life. I gave up any hopes of meeting someone a long time ago and haven't even tried looking for someome since then.   
I'm now working on this with the help of a therapist as well as working on my body and loosing weight. -35 lbs in a couple months, I'm quite happy. I'm not calling for comments about weight loss, I know this is hardly sustainable in the long run and I'm taking precautions to protect my health, I'm simply starting from a very high weight and the initial loss is naturally much faster than for someone starting from a lower weight.   
My therapist tries to help me accept my body as it is (while still working on improving it of course) but that's something I simply cannot do. Years of suffering due to obesity have deeply ingrained a feeling of hate and disgust about my own body. I feel it will take more time to accept my body with her hello than losing my extra weight and getting to a body I'll be comfortable in.

I still have a hard time processing and accepting what they told me.   
A recent rejection, or at least I took it as a rejection, from a woman who initially pursued me and for whom I still have a high interest, makes it even harder for me to accept their compliments. How can they see these things in me when I can't and women seemingly don't either, or at least, the ones I have a romantic interest for?   
I still don't know what to do and think about this recent ""rejection"" (I have another comment describing what happened in more details but after pursuing me and initiating a date and physical contact, she slowly broke off contact with me and told me she wasn't ready for a relationship after I told her what I felt for her: an interest in knowing her more, and that I wanted to see her again). I know I should just accept it and let it go but as the first woman ever to show that much interest for me, I have a very hard time doing just that.   
I'm certainly very immature in many ways, especially when it comes to human interactions and dating/romance. I'm working on that. That after party is typically the kind of thing I would have never went to before and I had to force myself to do so, I'm happy and proud I did.

So, I'm still a work in progress, I need to learn to love myself without first putting a condition on my looks and weight.

If I offer to pay, toxic masculinity.  
  
Don't offer to pay? Not a gentleman.  
  
Express interest in sex (at all, like even mention that I acknowledge the existence of sex) he's a player, all he wants is sex.  
  
Completely avoid the topic of sex, he's a prude, dead bedroom inbound  
  
Engage in touch at all (I like touching and physical closeness) creep, only wants sex  
  
Don't touch at all, cold, distant, prude  
  
Expressing emotions? You're unstable, you need therapy (because not strong)  
  
Concealing emotions? You're unstable, you need therapy (because emotionally unavailable)  
  
Expressing enthusiasm for hanging out and planning shared activity? Clingy  
  
Staying reserved and following her pace? Disinterested, unavailable  
  
Texts every day? Too available, too needy  
  
Texts every other day? Must not be too serious about this  
  
Responds immediately to messages- do you even have a life?  
  
Doesn't respond within 10 minutes of receiving messages- ""I feel like I don't matter to you""

And we only chill at night, at someone‚Äôs place.  It does bother me a bit because there‚Äôs benefit but not really friends.

If guys we‚Äôre actually friends with women.. It would be much more likely that women would sleep with you, instead of just doing the absolutely bare minimum and expecting it. Why not actually be friends with your fwb?",thats why i dont consider that fwb. you are each others booty call lmao.

dating,146g3an,1686444329.0,the guy that i‚Äôm talking to is telling me different things than what his friends are telling me. help,"i‚Äôve had a little crush on since he started at my job. and we started hanging out and it felt great. we get along really well. i even had that conversation with him about intentions so i knew what he was looking for. he said he didn‚Äôt wanna jump into something too fast. which is so valid bc neither do i. so i was happy that he wanted to kinda be slow with things. 
moving forward, everything was going well. exactly how anyone would want it to go. he says the great things and he makes plans and he wants to continue making more. but that‚Äôs all by what he says. if we go by our mutual friends‚Ä¶they have something different to say. they say that i need to step back and be careful. they say that he doesn‚Äôt want anything serious‚Ä¶so a relationship. they say he‚Äôs not as into me as he acts. 
it just doesn‚Äôt sit well with me. it really doesn‚Äôt. i keep thinking of reasons why that might not be true. like, maybe he just hasn‚Äôt opened up to those friends about him having feelings for me. or maybe he‚Äôs simply just afraid to admit that he does have feelings for someone. 
it just doesn‚Äôt seem right. he even said he wanted to take a day trip to the beach with me. that doesn‚Äôt seem like something someone would do if they didn‚Äôt want a relationship? i‚Äôm just lost here. i don‚Äôt want to have to start putting my guard back up. bc when i do that, i go cold. i can‚Äôt be casual about it.",if his friends tell you what he is like - actually believe them.  You are romanticizing offering to go to beach.  Stop listening to the words and watch the actions.  I hope you haven't been intimate with a work mate for your own sake. Protect yourself from your heart being hurt.  Sex doesn't convince a guy to like/ love us or even want a relationship.  Can't trick a man into a caring relationship if he's been clear he's not interested.

She left my place saying she's going to a brunch with friends and really she did because I saw her stories. She sends me a voice note saying she'll call me when she's outside my place. Her friends in the background. That was 8pm. I cooked something up and got snacks... Back of my mind knowing she not likely to come through.

She didn't. I get a text at 12AM with crying emojis and her saying she just got home. 

It's disrespectful to me. 

It also makes me realize that I've been a bit too forward. She complained how I never text her unless it's to make plans to see her. So I'll just get back to doing that. 

I was low-key heated, but I'm calm now. It's really not a big deal. Either she really got caught up with her friends, or it was her toying with me to see how I'd react. Anyway, I replied with ""okay then.""

Edit: she was drinking with her friends. I get that. But there's literally no reason to tell me you're gonna come over when I'm literally content watching the Champions League final on a cool Saturday night.

dating,146bjhu,1686432241.0,Levels of Cleanliness,"As many of us have realized, every relationship has a clean partner and a not as clean partner. 

Well, my gf is not a very clean person. Hell, I cannot sugar coat it, her house is absolutely filthy. It is getting so bad; I only bring myself to go over once a week.  I have her come over to my place as much as possible. But since she has pets at home, it is a rare occasion. 

She has 12 pets. 2 dogs, 2 cats and 8 birds. As well as having 2 kids, 13f & 10m, who refuse to help around the house.  I have tried to talk to them about helping their mom around the house and they both came back with ""it is not my job."" Now I do not think it is my place to tell her kids what to do in their house. But every time I go visit her place, I feel that I need clean. It is beyond a courtesy at this point.  

It is an extremely frustrating experience. Whenever I have her and her kids over, I make sure my place is presentable and clean. 

I hate eating there. There is animal hair is all over the place. If she hands me a utensil, dish, or cup, it is usually dirty. Everything use I have to wash. it has gotten to the point that when I get there cleaning her kitchen is usually my first task. Washing dishes, drying them, and putting them away. It always takes me a while because the sink is normally filled. 

Then I clean the floors. I do not take off my shoes, when I walk around her house. My feet turn black. If I wear socks, they get filled with animal hair. When I get home, I just toss my socks because there is no getting all the hair out of them. No matter how many times I wash them. Plus, the hair gets stuck on other clothes.  

I sweep and mop the kitchen, dining room, and living room. That usually helps with the smell of feces for most of the house. But then I have to empty the litter boxes to really get rid of the smell. I buy her scented candles and other air fresheners. But the lingering smell of poo is always there. 

And do not get me started on her laundry habits. It is sad and horrendous what she does to those loads.  I have not smelled a towel at her place that does not smell like it was left in the washer for a day or two before being dried. She is better with clothes. But folding them is another issue all together. 

She is a great person in all other aspects. She is extremely kind and giving and generous to where it is almost financially detrimental. If she were not so amazing, I would have left her long time ago.  

I have my own place. I work hard to maintain it and keep it up. But I know I will never want to live with her, unless things change. Because that will be my life for the foreseeable future.

Should I break it off now or stick it out because and cats and dogs do not live forever?","Man that's rough. Have you tried talking to her about it? She sounds like the type who'd be receptive to feedback.

As for the kids could you maybe suggest to her getting her kids to make their beds each morning? I used to have a somewhat messy room but then started making my bed and it kinda seemed to instill discipline into other areas of my life. It's a good starting point.

dating,146afvz,1686429480.0,Do men care about a little extra weight?,"Okay so I‚Äôm a bit uncomfortable with my current weight (5‚Äô2‚Äù 135)‚Ä¶ and it‚Äôs kind of hindered me from dating because I‚Äôm self conscious (I‚Äôm more comfortable in the lower 120s but I‚Äôm working toward getting back there). I went on a first date with this amazingly attractive man that checked all of my boxes. He‚Äôs also very much so in shape. He did ask for a second date but I canceled because I couldn‚Äôt find anything flattering to wear. When I canceled, I hadn‚Äôt heard from until yesterday (completely understandable). He wants to go out again. I told him that I‚Äôm not free this weekend but I‚Äôm free next weekend. Gives me time to find an outfit to boost my self esteem lol. 

My question is, would he be asking for a second date if the thickness mattered? Again, I am working on getting to a comfortable weight for ME, but in the meantime, will a fit guy be attracted to a woman trying to get back into shape?","If he wasn‚Äôt attracted to you, he wouldn‚Äôt have asked you out for a second date üòä"
dating,146abbl,1686429151.0,Is Reddit a good place for dating advice?,"Guess this is a meta question. People here are just looking for help and sometimes people are really nice and give great advice. 

However I‚Äôve noticed some people just attack others and it‚Äôs very toxic. I‚Äôve posted here for advice and people either give great advice or attack me. 

People of Reddit: we all are strangers. If you don‚Äôt have anything productive to say then don‚Äôt type! I think constructive criticism is welcome but empty insults aren‚Äôt helping anyone. 

People here are really struggling and a kind word goes a long way.

We went on a first date yesterday. It went REALLY WELL but there wasn't any physical contacts except when we were playing VR. We would occasionally push and hold onto each other to prevent falling. After the date, she texted me right away saying she had a great time and asked what I am doing over the summer, so I assumed she was interested and asked her out to watch a movie since we both love going to the theatres (she said yes). Should I ask her if she wants to hold hands, or just grab her hand during the movie? If I were to just grab her hand during the movie, how should I do it smoothly? If she rejects/pulls back her hand, how can I make it less awkward?

dating,1469ywk,1686428261.0,Very strange situation,"Hey,

I (F29) started to date a guy(M33) a few months ago. After 2 months he out of the blue texted me mine initials and my kids initials and he could even tell me what the full names were. 

I am no where to be found on the internet, I have zero social media. We don't have the same friends. He doesn't live nearby. So I was flabbergasted, but wasn't mad or something. I asked him how he figured it out and he didn't want to tell me. Thats when we got into a argument about it, because he didn't want to tell me how he knew this. After this argument he still didn‚Äôt want to tell me and he said he wasn't a serial killer or something. Next, he said as a ""joke"" that Jeffrey told him. I don't even know any Jeffrey at all!

Anyway I putted things aside because I didn't want to argue. Now weeks later I asked him again (in a nice, kind way) and he still doesn't want to tell me and acts mysterious and makes jokes about it.

dating,1469rfv,1686427719.0,"Is this normal for a date? Me F28, guy in question 34, almost 35 yo","Hi,

I (F28) am dating a guy (soon 35yo) and today was our 7th date. 

I told him I'm quite a romantic person and I would like him to come up with something to do for a date. 

We had a fight because in his opinion coffee dates are ok and guys don't have to pay for girls. In my opinion a guy needs to try a little bit. 
I earn enough to take myself out and get nice things / travel but would like a guy to try... At least a littl3 bit. 

On 5th date I organised a dinner for us and paid for both



Today was our 7th date and I travelled to see him in his city. He suggested going to a gallery. Apparently would always pass this gallery on his way to work but never actually went in. It was free and quite small and that's alright. Exhibition was quite poor as it was modern art and neither of us know anything about it lol


Anyhow. After that I said we can go for a walk. I thought we might go to a cafe or grab a bite somewhere. He started walking and asked if I'm hungru to which I replied yes. His response was :""ok, we can go to this shop on the way to my place. We can get something to eat and have some tea"" 

Thing is - we never discussed going to his place. He just assumed. We literally just went there (him leading me). He never asked if I wanted to come. Mind you I would've been cool with that but... Without even asking? Am I being paranoid? 


We watched a tv show. I ate a sandwich and had some tea and at some point he started kissing me. I like it and we made out for a while. He asked if I wanted to go to the bedroom, I nodded no, sort of smiled and pulled back a little. 

I tried cuddling /Hugging him after that but he got up, went to the loo and we didn't kiss/ hug anymore. 


I'm getting bad vibes but I might be over thinking this? 
The biggest problem for me is he only wanted to kiss when it would lead to sex (immediately) and didn't ask if I wanted to come to his place. We literally just wemt there lol


Tl;dr is this normal for the 7 the  date - a guy, M35 and me(F28) met at a gallery and he then took me straight to his place without asking if I wanted to come.
Kissing only seemed to lead to sex.
Is that normal or have I mot been dating for ages?",I think he sounds really cheap and I wouldn't really be happy seeing a guy. Like him. You have to trust your Gut instead if you feel uncomfortable with him and don't like the way hes acting. Then he's not for you. I definitely like a guy to spend a little more money on me and I would never have payed for him like you did
dating,1469r19,1686427689.0,Am I wrong to ask my BF to not discuss our relationship problems with his family?,"My (36M) BF and I (33F) had a discussion about moving forward in our relationship, which has always been rocky. It was going well until I told him that one of the requirements I have moving forward is that any issues we have with each other should be kept between us. I said that it just invites more strife and chaos when you add other people to the mix because everyone has their own opinion and if either of us feels validated by someone else's opinion it just further adds to the problem, especially if we had already come to an agreement and one of us brings it up to someone else and that person disagrees with what we agreed on. It opens up the potential for more arguments and disagreements. EX, we had come to an agreement about chores and how to best go about them. Yet he still complained to his mom about our agreement, and his mom said that what I had said was BS and that I was just being lazy. He then came home and accused me of being lazy and not doing enough (I do all of the chores by myself 99% of the time, except for laundry because i hate folding laundry so it sits in the basket for a few days) and since he worked outside of the home I shouldn't expect him to help out with chores because i'm home all day (Im a SAHM). When I talked to her about some  things that were bothering me before,  she told me that she didn't think he ever loved me, that he was only with me because of the kids, and that he had a shot at something great with his ex wife had he stayed on his meds, further adding onto insecurities I already had.
She'd basically plays both sides, and my boyfriend and I would fight about whoever  his mom agreed with was right and the other person was wrong. 
He couldn't agree to not talking to his family about our issues and said that I was trying to isolate him. 
He said that I had a therapist to talk to, saying that if he couldn't talk to his family about these things, who else was  he supposed to talk to. I told him to get a therapist. He said he didn't want a therapist. He wanted to talk to his family and that he would decide which issues he would and wouldn't talk about. I told him that I couldn't move forward then because it adds to the general distrust that we both have and that I didn't feel safe discussing anything with him because I can't be sure what he'll say to his family.
He said it wasn't fair that I had someone to talk to and that I wanted to isolate him. I told him that I wasn't isolating him, I was asking him to not talk to his family about our relationship issues, and that its different talking to a therapist because a therapist isn't going to talk shit about the other person, and they also won't talk to others about what was discussed.

In the end he said that he wasn't going to agree to my request, so I told him that that meant that there wouldn't be anymore discussions between us then because I didn't feel safe talking to him about anything going on because I don't know what he would and wouldn't tell other people.

Am I in the wrong here?",You‚Äôre not wrong. What goes on between y‚Äôall should stay between y‚Äôall. Not everyone wants their dirty laundry aired.

We met and were close to sleeping with each other, but we paused mid-way. Before I left I could tell he was upset, and I‚Äôm pretty sure it was because we stopped. I knew I upset him, so I sent him a message in the morning apologizing. He told me I did nothing wrong and that everything was ‚Äúall good‚Äù although, my gut‚Äôs telling me otherwise.

Later, I asked him how he felt about our situation and he told me that he didn‚Äôt know how to answer the question‚Ä¶.

I told him I was confused and thought that we shouldn‚Äôt continue if it was going to be like this, but wanted to hear his opinion‚Ä¶.

He responded a few hours later & said this:

dating,14696fh,1686426244.0,Second guessing myself,"Hi,

I \[31M\] recently dated this girl \[33F\]. We saw each other several times over a period of maybe 2 weeks, I think -- so not a very long time at all. We would text daily, and all of those times we were together were incredibly awesome, and I cherish the memories. I thought we vibed \*really\* well.

Intimacy set in during the 3rd date... at which point I realized that the romantic feelings did not manifest physically -- no pounding in my chest, no arousal, etc. I was really surprised and taken off guard. It was late, and I was tired, so I didn't think too much of it, and we decided we would focus on her pleasure.

Then, during the 4th date, things escalated again, and I realized on the spot that I was still unable to ""perform"", and that it was likely due to my taking antidepressants (SSRIs) to treat mild-to-moderate anxiety... they are notorious for provoking side effects of that nature. Nothing seemed to work, and I felt absolutely nothing down there... it was quite traumatizing and frustrating. We laid there for a moment, after which she told me I reminded her of her suicidal ex, who had also struggled with similar issues because of antidepressants. She said she would take a couple of days to think about whether what we had going was worth pursuing...

The next day, I texted her to let her know that it probably wasn't meant to be if she wasn't sure, as the entire experience did seem to have upset her a lot. That put an end to it.

Her decision was probably headed that way, but now I wonder what would have happened if I had waited for her to make up her mind... waited before getting intimate...

I really liked that person... and probably got attached emotionally way too quick, so it is a tremendously traumatizing experience overall... So much so that I have decided to discontinue my treatment, because I feel as though it may have ruined something that could have been great.

I'm hurting so much... I'm happy that I seem to be recovering normal sensation ""down there"", but I don't feel ready to date again, because every time I swipe, I look for her in other people... I constantly feel like I need to resist the urge to contact her again, and I feel so stupid for letting myself feel that way about someone I hardly knew.

Ugh... thanks for reading... I guess I just needed this off my chest.",People often take that very personaly so it‚Äôs impossible to know. But make sure you get to a doctor and reduce your dose so it isn‚Äôt a problem in the future

Things are going great and he's the first person I feel comfortable with. I recently told him that Iove him and he reciprocated. Things seem to be going fine at one cost, I am friends with a ex fwb and that bothers him. Keep in mind he isn't really whiny about it in the sense that he doesn't really ask about him when we hang out and is fine with other guy friends. However he he's not use to being in relationships where people are still friends with ex flings. He recently told me that if we are gonna move forward in the relationship I'm gonna need to drop this friend of mine otherwise we aren't gonna work. He said its okay If I don't want to but he's holding his ground saying that he's never gonna be comfortable with it even if he knows I'll  ever cheat on him. I don't know what to do, he's a really nice guy who's always kept me together and I can see myself being long term with him.

dating,1468rmd,1686425181.0,Am I a cheater?,"When this dude I met (we will call him Junior) and I got into a relationship not even a couple days in he developed feelings for this random girl (one of my friends ‚Äúgirlfriends‚Äù).

dating,1468h90,1686424434.0,Can't really date anyone when everyone annoys me,"Title

Not really looking for advice as I know I need to just go out more and socialize, but that in of itself is largely the issue and maybe someone here has good advice. 27 M if that means anything.

I've always been like this for as long as I can remember. Whether it's due to a life long history of being treated by shit by most people throughout school life and past that or something else I'm not super sure, but in general I find trying to socialize with most people to be a chore and I'd rather just not participate. 

I've had a few relationships in the past. Anything during high school never really lasted all that long (a week at most), and everything after high school has been long distance and doomed to fail (cheated on twice but should've seen that one coming). I've had largely minimal instances of women showing interest in me, and the few instances that it has happened I was either too drunk to make an actual call on anything or I'd rather not embarrass myself assuming they were into me when they weren't.

I wouldn't say I have issues approaching women in the dating sense but it's like, for me personally, why bother when it's unlikely we have anything in common and I would just end up losing interest. I really only came to this realization recently where I've noticed that outside of a few friends I have, most people I talk to are genuinely extremely boring or genuinely awful to converse with.

The few relationships I have had I did genuinely try my hardest with as those few women I did date I did have genuine interest in and we did gel with each other quite well but it just never worked out (usually because they were cheating but again guess I should've expected that given the relationships were long distance).

To be honest with this post I sort of expect to get flamed/roasted or whatever but I genuinely can't really vent about this to friends anymore as none of them care or just tell me to go out and socialize more.","It‚Äôs a tough crowd. I can relate. I‚Äôm a nerdy person who likes to read and talk abt philosophy, history, politics, science but also I wanna do outdoorsy things like hiking. 
It‚Äôs hard finding someone one who fits with my interests so I usually end up compromising. Even then it doesn‚Äôt work. So yeah it just feels like a waste of energy.

Why bother but then being in relationship is really nice so idk"
dating,1468cig,1686424097.0,What could make you (M) feel friendzoned?,"Or what could make you not start a move?

So, I (22F) have been told by my friends (M/F) and strangers that I am a beautiful girl, every now and then I get complimented on my style, pics on SM etc. so I really, really, don‚Äôt hope that my appearance is throwing people off.

I am a social butterfly, tend to get along with most people and make friends easily‚Ä¶
But, although I get complimented, I never had anyone of my guy friends flirt with me or anything like that. My guy friends call me ‚ÄúQueen‚Äù, when they see me, one of them told me I always look hot when he was drunk (he was in a relationship at the time but they just broke things of), they say I am the coolest person they know etc pp.
I only have one guy friend with whom I have this low-key flirty-banter relationship with but I thinks that just our friendship dynamic and nothing more. Also, I just moved countries..

I‚Äôve been told that ppl have felt intimidated bc they thought I looked ‚Äòtoo cool‚Äô and or been surprised when I i.e. approached/complimented them (back).

I know, y‚Äôall can‚Äôt see how I act in real life so the answers can only go so far, but I talked to one of my friends about it and she told me maybe I‚Äôm not ‚Äúmysterious‚Äù enough and that I need to disclose myself a little more maybe to make guys ‚Äúchase‚Äù me lol. I don‚Äôt wanna be ignorant cuz maybe there is some good advice but also, my inner ENFP-stubbornness is just saying heeeeeeeeelll, no. Why should I conform to random norms or ‚Äúgames‚Äù ppl have made up in order to attract someone who wouldn‚Äôt be attracted to me otherwise, you get me?

She did say sth else, like I thought maybe I‚Äôm friendzoning my guy friends and that‚Äôs the reason? I don‚Äôt know if it has anything to do with it but I did grow up with 5 brothers and maybe, I don‚Äôt know maybe I act too amicable? But what does this mean? What things could a girl do that would make you feel friendzoned? 

Cuz I don‚Äôt need a man or a relationship, but growing up and never having anyone like me in my life (or at least they didn‚Äôt tell me), to having my friends confess to each other and having guys and even our roommates telling them they like them to all of the girls I live with but me, I don‚Äôt know it makes me sometimes wonder why it never happened to me, you know?",I would guess you‚Äôre not giving signs that you are interested in a relationship.

Some people think I have a masculine complex but I don‚Äôt see it. I do love men.,"You first decide if a relationship would even be possible. If there are deal breakers that exist and you know about them from the start, don't even bother dating the person.

If you decide to pursue a relationship, then you take the time to get to know them well before you allow yourself to get too deeply invested. Make sure you are taking time out from being infatuated to consider the situation rationally, and get advice from people who care about you and are wise enough to give good advice. 

Keep in mind that most relationships start off being wonderful. You're infatuated, flush with happy brain chemicals, and everyone is on best behavior. If you start seeing things you don't like after a few months, understand that those are ""the real him"" and most likely things you'll be dealing with for the long term. 

You really can't know in the beginning if someone is right for you, simply because you really don't know them as a partner until they've been a partner for a while. It's more of a hindsight thing.

(He being the graduate of my university) the dates went well and we started talking to each other for hours daily. It was about the time when i had to leave my city for the college again. He was very sad to see me go and wanted to see me for the last time that day but I couldn‚Äôt meet him due to family reasons. He ghosted me because he was angry and sad about it. I confronted him and we went back to being normal. Then he said he wants me to meet his parents before he leaves india(he is planning of settling abroad so wanted to introduce me to the family) we were just getting to know each other only. It‚Äôs been 2-3 days and we didn‚Äôt even know anything about each other but he got sure about me being the one for him. Then he mentioned on 3rd day that he wants unprotected intercourse and wasn‚Äôt ready to listen to me i am so against this but we fought over this. Knowing how risky this is. Then he started commenting on my looks and what all he wants to change in my appearance jokingly. Which I didn‚Äôt like as i felt i never wanted to change anything in his looks then why does he want that from me(me being way superior to him in looks). Then days passed by we were getting closer to each other and he mentioned about his previous sexual experiences which I didn‚Äôt like at all as those people were my known. He laughed the situation and said sorry and it went back to normal. I forgave him. Then on the 10th day he got angry on me for deleting my comment on his picture because of personal reasons which were way too valid and he told me to separate
 our paths and how this thing won‚Äôt work between us (mind you he is saying i love you to me since the starting) he said a lot of things like i am so done with you you need to leave even when i was trying to calm him down then i just gave up and said bye. After some time he started calling and texting me like crazy apologising and gaslighting me into not stopping him from going away even when i tried like anything. I never wanted a person who wont be scared to lose me when he is angry and can‚Äôt have a communication. He even removed me from his socials when he was angry. 
Can someone let me know if i did the right thing leaving him and properly communicating to him as to why I didn‚Äôt want a man like that?",It sounds like you did the right thing.

dating,1465wnu,1686417947.0,"Just give me a straight up answer, don‚Äôt sugar coat it.","What‚Äôs up with this dude? 

I (22) met a guy (21) over a month ago at a college bar. He was staring at me all night, but never approached me so finally when he just stayed lingering around me all night, I finally said something to break the ice. He sat with me all night, but didn‚Äôt say much, but also wouldn‚Äôt leave my side. I took it as he wasn‚Äôt interested so I didn‚Äôt bother asking for his number or anything and left that night in the dust. 

The next morning, his friend snapchats my girl friend I was out with and says his buddy, the one I met, really wanted my number. I gave it to him through his friend which was weird, but I figured maybe he‚Äôs shy so I found it kinda cute. He texts me a couple hours later and we text for a week and the conversation was pretty dry and he took a long time to reply. So I stopped texting, figured he wasn‚Äôt interested or was stringing me along. 

A couple days later, after i stoped texting him, he asked if I wanted to go get ice cream and ‚Äúhangout‚Äù at like 10:00 PM. I wasn‚Äôt sure if that meant hooking up, which I‚Äôm not interested in, but I agreed anyway and the date itself was fine. We cuddled a little and watched TV and talked and that was it. Super innocent.

I texted him after the date, saying thanks for paying and yadda yadda, and he continued the conversation. Like before, still pretty dry and we would take hours to respond, but he kept it going.

Fast forward to a couple weeks ago, he texted me saying hes home for summer break and I joked and said ‚Äúok see you never ig‚Äù and he said he‚Äôd see me again when he‚Äôs back. But he sorta left me on read after and he‚Äôs not back till August. We haven‚Äôt texted since and I doubt we‚Äôll text again.

Is this dude playing me, is he immature, shy, or am I reading too much into this? Maybe he‚Äôs just not into texting, but to me, that shows a level of disinterest. How can he swoop back in August when we‚Äôre not gonna text all summer? Or am I delusional for thinking he‚Äôll actually hit me up again? I‚Äôm just confused.

Hope this all makes sense, any advice or insight would be greatly appreciated!üòÖ","He definitely likes you, more than he normally does, I am guessing. He lacks confidence. He doesn‚Äôt know how to proceed. He doesn‚Äôt know how to make this situation into something more.

Anyways last night we were hanging out and he ended up starting the conversation about not being ready for a relationship. I‚Äôll just list out his key points he made: 

-he thinks I‚Äôm wonderful, it‚Äôs not like he is sitting at home being like if OP was XYZ I would want a relationship. He said if he were ready he would want one with me.
-he didn‚Äôt think it was fair to ask me to wait and not see other guys while he figures out his own stuff. I told him I had been going on other dates and he was glad to hear it but then was like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt really want to know about those dates. I‚Äôm just glad your not waiting‚Äù
-he still wants to go on dates and talk on the phone. He really doesn‚Äôt want to lose my friendship he said. 
-if I do end up in a relationship, he still really wants to be my friend and be able to call and talk to me because I‚Äôm one of his best friends
-he finds me insanely attractive

dating,1462smj,1686410114.0,Need help in understand my feelings and the situation,"
I (25F) was in a casual relationship with (29M), from beginning we were very clear about keeping casual things between us as we both weren‚Äôt each other‚Äôs type but we were attracted with each other and seemed nice to each other (more like friends) we also decided to be transparent about our feelings and if we are seeing someone or going on dates with each other. Things were great for 8-9 months until now. We used to meet couple of times in a week and I also went on few dates separately in the mean time but I never liked any of those guys so it ended up just one date with them whereas he didn‚Äôt go on any days with someone as according to him he is busy and doesn‚Äôt have much time on spare.
 But I went on more date where me and my date (let‚Äôs name him James) really hated off and I wanted to see how that goes so I asked him to stop for now as I really wanted to see where it goes with James, but unfortunately James had his own issues so after couple of dates he stopped.
So I again started talking to my casual but few times I felt he is getting jealous when the topic came up about me and James. Two months passed and one day out of nowhere he came and said let‚Äôs not continue and meet for one last time. When I asked him what happened he said things are getting intense (I still have no clue what exactly it means). I met him the next day and none of us really spoke about it and we stopped talking for next 2 weeks. (Not going to lie that time I felt like knife getting stabbed in my guts). 
But after 2 weeks he messaged me and trying to have conversation in the morning and wanted to meet me on the same day, but as I was busy I agreed on meeting him the next day. But later the evening he was very drunk and called me and we spoke for an hour and a half where he said he stopped because he was getting very attached with me and even if we decide to move forward with this we wouldn‚Äôt be able to work out as we are poles different to each other. I met him the next day and the same we didn‚Äôt talk anything about it as he wanted to sleep. I assumed he remembered our conversation and is trying to avoid it.
In the following week we were messaging and he said he is going and I am usually used to making fun of him with his age and he is not married so I asked him where are you going and that if he is getting married to which he replied yes in 3 days(of course he was messing around about the marriage) but at this point I was having mixed feelings, so I decided to confront him that if he remembers anything about what he said to me and he said yes but he also said let‚Äôs not continue. I said ok but I didn‚Äôt wanted to stop seeing him and was having mixed feelings about the entire situation as in my mind it was clear he likes me and I wasn‚Äôt sure what I feel like.
After 2-3 weeks I was in stress with my university and I was missing him as well and due to the stress I couldn‚Äôt hold back my emotions  and he is the best place for me to vent too so I messaged him. We were messaging and that time he told me he lied about the night he was drunk actually he doesn‚Äôt have any memories as he was very drunk. At this point I started feeling my anxiety has reduced a little which was there from last 2 weeks. But he also told me he is seeing someone and if everything works out well things can get serious. I again started having mixed feelings and I felt a little jealous somewhere. After that we just met once and we haven‚Äôt talked since. And I am now convinced that now he is seeing someone he won‚Äôt message me.
I need help to understand what happened that lead to all this to get a closure and what are my feelings towards him as I really feel he is my safe spot to vent and I miss him too but have to hold myself because in theory it‚Äôs over. Or am I just attached to him and it is a matter of time and I will be ok? Or is it just about me feeling him as a space spot to vent?",Maybe it can be that when you were going on dates with James he was very jealous and maybe he was hurt somewhere because people tend to catch feelings or get attached in this casual relationships. Maybe that hurt or jealousy led him to do this? It can also be that since he said things were getting intense and maybe he didn‚Äôt get the same energy from you that‚Äôs why he wants move on and get with someone he can be distracted with. But all that being said it doesn‚Äôt justify how he behaved in the end because you need closure of what happened and all of a sudden he is seeing someone that he can get serious with whereas you had been in this casual relationship for 8/9 months and he didn‚Äôt think to take a chance? Also about the fact that you are pole opposites..this doesn‚Äôt matter if you hit it off with someone. Sometimes polar opposites workout just as fine as people with a lot similarities and vice versa.

dating,1462bxc,1686408967.0,Scared to let him see what I really look like,"A little background:
I (22F) work in a salon and I am required to wear makeup every day for work. I usually end up waiting until later in the night to take it off just because I'm usually busy with errands or other things and find that it's just easier that way. Because of this, most of the pictures I have of myself are with makeup on. 

I've been talking to a guy (28) who lives about 2 hours away. We've talked every day for about a month, and met up and gone on dates twice now, which of course I wore makeup on. But today will be the first time that he's coming to see me and spending the night, and I'm so scared for him to see me when I'm all dressed down and have a bare face. I have acne scars from when I was a teenager and recently have been having some really bad break outs, so I ALSO look worse than I normally would. And to be clear, I don't think my face itself is ugly, I like my face, I just don't have very nice (some would even say bad) skin. 

So I just don't know what to do... and please no one say ""he'll like you for you!"", I know he likes my personality, it's my face that I don't want to run him off with...",[deleted]
dating,146277l,1686408546.0,How do I begin to date given my sexual history?,Im 18 I have only been in two sexual relationships were the only reason the girls were with me is because I was spending money on them and giving them money to spend. The first situation was spur of the moment and when I was around 17 years old the 34 year old asked me for money to help pay a bill and after I helped her we had sex almost as a reward I didn't speak to her again after that.I thought that this was how men are supposed to keep girls around so this time I got myself into a situation where I wanted to meet a girl as I took a liking to her so I gave her some money to spend when she came to my city we did meet and have sex but immediately after she blocked me on everything. Its only now that I have been blocked that I recognise the relationships that I am having with these women is the exact same as paying for sex as the women didn't like me for me but what I could provide how do I move away from these types of relationships and when entering relationships in the future how do I tell them about me basically paying for sex in the past?,34f with 17m.

I feel like I've been trying to make plans with the same women the past few weeks and it's like working in sales. I'm having to to constantly ask, pray I have perfect timing, and try to set a meeting. I've tried sending voice messages and pictures to make my conversations more engaging but it doesn't seem like it's working. 

Multiple women have also told me they think I am not that interested in them. It makes me wonder what other guys are doing. Should I be calling more instead of texting? Maybe it would prioritize me in their life more?

I am just trying to figure out how to compete! Thanks!","I have a personal policy of asking twice tops. If I get a ""no"" the second time I stop talking to them. A woman that's interested will usually make things easier for you. If she's coming up with all these excuses for why she can't meet you and she doesn't propose an alternative date, she's probably not interested. Could also be that she's just scared or unsure, but the reason doesn't matter. It's a waste of time and you're better off moving on"

dating,1461d2e,1686406466.0,I got ghosted - should I move on or try and talk to her again?,"She 30F had a crush on me 26M and then ghosted me?


It all starts with a mutual friend of hours who happens to work at the same company as me. Me and him aren‚Äôt super close, but we‚Äôre what you‚Äôd call great work friends. He‚Äôs my favorite coworker, I see him on the way to work as he lives a bit closer so we usually meet up and walk the final leg. A coffee buddy, but not necessarily a go out party buddy or anything like that. He‚Äôs a few years my senior and has kids and a wife putting him in a completely different stage in life. 

Anyway, the story goes that he mentioned someone who lives in my building I think he went to college with, but I get the impression it was more so a friend of his wives who also went to the same school. I had never paid attention to this girl, but seen her a few times around the high rise. You know like when you see a person and you‚Äôd recognize them, but wouldn‚Äôt do anything beyond that. I don‚Äôt recall if I ever even said hello. Again it‚Äôs one of those things, IDK why, but some people I say hello to right when I get on the elevator others I don‚Äôt. 

He mentions her and how she said ‚Äúwho‚Äôs that guy he‚Äôs so handsome‚Äù and said she‚Äôs been crushing on me or a secret admirer I guess you‚Äôd call it. He first told me this at the end of April. 

Well, finally I met her bumping into her I introduced myself we chatted for a couple mins and that was that. Again, a few days later I ran into her in the package room we rode the elevator up and just said hello. Not too much at all. 

I felt like after the first interaction things were good, I think she knew I‚Äôd heard obviously what my friend had said but wasn‚Äôt awkward at all. We just smiled she said her name etc. 

Next thing you know, she‚Äôs popping up everywhere on Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, so a couple days after I see this I shoot her a follow request on Instagram.  I check back the next day, still on requested. Then, the following day I go back and it says follow.  WTF? Did I just get ghosted? 

Also, I shot her a funny message on our housing portal app it‚Äôs like a community app where we submit vendor tickets, pay bills, and it has everyone‚Äôs contact in there where you can DM. 

I sent one on there. A week later I‚Äôm sitting on ghosted 2x. 

Eventually I‚Äôll have to see her again simply by chance, but I‚Äôm absolutely going to take a backseat role here ‚Äî right? My friend absolutely wouldn‚Äôt send me off, but we aren‚Äôt so close that I‚Äôd bother him over this. And based on the girls friendliness etc when we first introduced, she definitely seemed interested. 

FWIW, I know she‚Äôs really close with this other girl I am friendly with who‚Äôs married. Me and this girl and sometimes her husband all keep the same schedule and she‚Äôs super friendly almost like she‚Äôs interested for her friend, if that makes sense. I haven‚Äôt seen her recently to notice any change in her attitude but will definitely be watching for it. I don‚Äôt even know her name, but we chat a lot when we run into each other. 

What do my next steps look like? It seems obvious if she was super into me she would‚Äôve at least replied to my message? Maybe too soon for IG, but IDK the whole thing seems off‚Ä¶ 

Honestly it won‚Äôt be awkward for me, but I feel bad if I did something that turned her away. I‚Äôm fine with just being neighbors at a distance.","Whatever her reasoning was, the question you have to ask yourself is do you really want to be with someone who doesn't know how to communicate and will most likely run away from problems when they arise ?
Because that's exactly what ghosting is along with a lack of consideration and respect for the other party involved."

dating,14619op,1686406229.0,I (35F) was just let down by a guy (35M) who said he had given up on dating. One my best friends (37M) said he gave up too. How common is that?,"Maybe I'm coming in after the war happened, but this is a new one to me.

  
I met said guy through a mutual acquaintance, we shared similar interests so I got his number and messaged him from time to time. We went to a convention together and also ate a few times together. Not official dates, just talking about stuff and life. I thought there was a good connection, and he's the discreet sort, so I went forward and asked him out ""officially"". He was dumfounded, which was fun at first. Then he shook his head. We talked a bit more about it, apparently he had never been asked out and never had a girlfriend before. And at this point, he was done trying. 

  
We still meet up every now and then, sometimes the topic comes up. I thought that if it doesn't click well with me, at least I hope he keeps an open mind for other people. He replied that he does click with me, but he thinks that ship has sailed for him.

  
I discussed that with some friends. Turns out, another dude I know is in a similar situation, no girlfriend, no sex ever. It's even weirder in his case, as he apparently had someone that was head over heels into him not too long ago, and she didn't mind his lack of experience. He himself said she was great and it gave him fuzzy feelings, but all the same he let her down gently. He told me someone was into him, at least once in his life, and that's victory enough for him.

  
It's still novel to me. So I'd like to know, have you had similar experiences in your social circles?","We're tired.  It's a huge rat race that revolves around a lot of competition and I just don't have it in me anymore. 

Found someone I thought I could really fall for, hah, she was still quietly hoping her ex would come back.  

Found a different one that was good, she was too worried about what the world would think about our age difference (she was older). 

I'm just tired.  It's been an uphill battle with absolutely fuck all to show for it.  What's the point?"

dating,1460pzq,1686404834.0,Am I being shallow ?,"I (26F) joined a dating app not too long ago and I started talking to this guy who on paper sounded like a perfect match for me. We met up for a first date this week but when I saw him and although I recognised him, I thought he looked different from his pictures. First of all he was much larger than he appeared on the app but even his face, vibe and style was so different from his pictures. On the app he looked well put together whereas in person he was dressed like he just grabbed whatever was available in his closet at the time.
I quickly brushed that aside and we ended up having a nice time, the discussion flowed fairly easily and we have a lot in common but in spite of it I still could not feel any romantic spark. 
I told him (with as much empathy as possible) that I was not interested in a second date.
Now I'm wondering if I'm just being shallow for refusing to pursue a relationship with someone just because I'm not into them physically ? Should I have pushed past my initial feeling ?","I don't think this qualifies as shallow. If there is something that throws you off just go with it. If you're not into them you're not into them. While it being a purely physical thing isn't necessarily good, if that's what it is be honest with yourself and look for what you want."

Does he like me or he‚Äôs just not interested enough? Is there something I should be doing or not doing? Should I just move on?","He doesn‚Äôt seem interested enough, sorry. And to me, it seems evident from the lack of communication that happens when he is physically away from you."

dating,145xgsb,1686395319.0,Ex happy birthday,"After breaking up 1.5 months before and still being in small contact with my ex I decided this was not the best for me to move forward. We ended on good terms after a relatively I guess short relationship. For me it was long as it my first time. In reflection it was largely wrong timing and both needing to do some inner work. But maybe even with that we are not compatible as I was needing a level of commitment.
Despite this I had become very attached. I was open to my ex and said I would no longer contact him for the time being and asked if he could do the same. I said maybe in a few months I‚Äôd be open to working on a friendship, but I wasn‚Äôt sure if I could. I didn‚Äôt really feel like I was valued for being myself. My ex was supportive of this but asked if I could still message for his birthday about 2.5 weeks later. I feel conflicted by this.

She constantly sends me a picture that she's eating somewhere and teasing me that it might be some guy just to annoy me. In a dark humour way. In reality, she's with her parents. And when I tell her jokingly that she's lying that there's a guy, she replies that she likes only one guy and would do anything for him, and she has no other guys. 

What should I do in this situation? To me, it seems like she likes me, but at the same time, it feels like she tells about herself and what kind of type she is.

dating,145wqp2,1686392880.0,How to stop looking for a husband?,"I'm 30 years old, very pretty, successful, but I never was happy in a relationship. It seems I'm unlovable, everyone gets bored with me after several months and nobody has any feelings towards me. There were friends that wanted to date me, but after months in friendzone I couldn't look at them this way.

My biggest dream since I remember was to be a wife and a mom. I don't believe I could be happy without a family. I am on dating apps for 3 years. I met 40 guys, dated 7, but nobody has developed any feelings towards me.

It's very rare to me to be attracted to someone, so when I feel attraction I get attached very fast and I don't want to give up even if someone treats me bad and shows they don't love me. Most guys that I met told me they want a family and treat me seriously, but after some time they lose interest. I tried different methods and nothing works. If someone tells me they want children, I just start imagining our life together. When they step back, I panic and do everything to keep them. I don't learn anything.

Most people tell me to be patient, but I hate being single. I want to cuddle, I want to have sex, I want someone to go out together. Also I want to have children and don't want to wait till 40.

Since my last break up I'm very depressed. I feel better when I meet someone and then when it doesn't work I'm depressed again. I'm addicted to dating apps and texting with someone. I know it's not healthy and probably guys can sense that I'm desperate. I was on therapy, but it didn't help me at all, it made me even more depressed knowing how my childhood and lack of love destroyed me.

We split up, but then he reached out a few months later and we started talking again but decided to figure out the details during a visit. I went to go see him and was very excited. When I got there, however, I was surprised to see that he was acting pretty aloof with me. He told me how happy he was in his new life, how he couldnt imagine living anywhere else, and didn‚Äôt understand why people didn‚Äôt live in his new town. He also criticized me for calling his new town by an old nickname, pointed out someone he had made out with during our break and said she was needy, and joked about how many people he could hypothetically get with in his new town. 

It all made me feel like an outsider or awkward interloper who didn‚Äôt belong. I told him I was happy for him, but also that his over the top happiness made me wonder whether he was trying to send me a message: either that he was over me, or he wanted to start dating, or something. 

He shut down and got really upset. He said that he was just acting normal, and that if there was any weirdness, then it must be something about me that was causing that. He got upset that I would criticize him for his happiness, and project my own insecurities of our relationship onto him unfairly. I told him that I guessed I misread things. 

We haven‚Äôt talked about it again, except when he told me he talked to his friends and told me they said he was not overly happy and so again I must be the one unfairly projecting my feelings. What do I do? Leave? Talk about it again?

Tldr: ldr crush/situationship invited me to see him then acted distant and happy without me","Personally? I think him randomly pointing out a girl he made out with to you is a big red flag. 

Now I don‚Äôt know his perspective of events, but assuming things happened exactly how you described, it does read as though his behavior is at least strange. And even if he was being ‚Äònormal‚Äô, I feel as though you bringing up your concern shouldn‚Äôt have made him shut down or really upset. 

A friend of mine dated a guy who displayed some of these traits so I might be a little biased here, but I really believe that everyone deserves someone who very obviously wants them around. 

Now since it seems like you‚Äôre actively on this trip, I would say still try to feel things out. See if his attitude changes, if he become more welcoming. If it‚Äôs more of the same, when you go back home, you‚Äôll be able to really think about whether you want to continue this relationship. If it gets really bad, I would leave (if you have the means).

dating,145w23d,1686390594.0,"Need advice on my relationship. I 27 m gf 25f have no physical affection anymore, dating 2+ years","In the beginning the relationship was great, no amazing. She was always showing me affection everyday and my love language is affection it always has been. Probably due to never receiving any as a kid. But anyways she always had dinner cooked for me, always kissing me, hugging and just small things she‚Äôd always do for me. For me this was new. I never received the love she gave me like anyone I‚Äôve ever been with. I‚Äôve never been lucky with relationships. I‚Äôm the guy that would go out of my way to make sure anyone I was with that there happiness was above mine. Always making sure they had everything then need. Not just material thing, more like small things like. Cooking dinner, asking if they need a massage after work, running bubble baths, asking if the need any type of snack, drinks and etc. So for me having someone do that for me was a 180 in a relationship. Pam ( we‚Äôll call my gf Pam) was always all over me. Not only was Pam affectionate towards me with the normal ( hugs, kissing, etc) but sex. I remember some days I would be trying to sleep and she would start trying to have sex with me. It was like 5+ times a week. I‚Äôve never has someone that into me. Of course no matter how tired I was I‚Äôd always go with it.

Now 4 to 5 months have passed things got less and less. Which I just was like yep the honeymoon phase is over. 5+ times a week became, 1 to 2 a week. Which I cool with, cause she was wearing me out üòÖ. The the kissing would slow down also which I noticed it, but never took it into consideration. 

6 to 7 months in love making becomes 1 or 2 a month, kissing becomes 1 to 2 a week. Affection becomes less and less.

While all this is happening. I‚Äôm still doing everything for her, making sure all of her needs are met and then some. Buying and building custom/ random gift baskets for her. Her favorite candy, wine, face masks, bath items. Literally $100+ gift baskets. Cause I knew she was going through some hard time with work and other personal stuff going on in her like. Also I should mention she has a 3 year old son. Which was something I didn‚Äôt want to get into when we first started talking, but I genuinely like this girl and told myself this would be worth it. First off  Sam‚Äôs (we‚Äôll call him Sam) dad is a pos! Like major POS! 
I had a terrible childhood growing up. I don‚Äôt have a father or mother. So I know it‚Äôs hard (well I do have them adopted parents, but they treated us so bad. I can talk about that in another post if you want to hear it) So for me I always said if I had a kid I‚Äôd treat him better that anything in this world, for Sam that‚Äôs what I want. I know I‚Äôm not his dad but I want him to feel loved. Even if his real father doesn‚Äôt do anything for him.

But back to it. So now we‚Äôve hit a year in and any sort of affection has drop tremendously. I still show her in other was since sex and kissing happens once in a blue moon. Always asking if she needs anything. Just to make sure she knows im still here for her and my affection hasn‚Äôt gone anywhere.
 But it‚Äôs all one sided. And im torn on what to do. Yes, we‚Äôve talked about it. Normally every two months I get tired of not receiving any sort of affection or attention. We talk about it, she always tells me it‚Äôs her and she has no want for sex or kissing. Then she tells me that I should ask if I want something. I hate having to ask for a kiss let alone sex. I feel like I shouldn‚Äôt have to ask. But I never ask, I just try and do things to turn her on, but get no physical emotion from her. Or she flat out tells me no.

So now at the beginning of this year. I‚Äôve pretty stop trying at all and just leave it to her when she wants any sort of affection that way. And I‚Äôve gotten to the point where sex is irrelevant, but I would rather have a kiss then sex.

Valentines comes around and we get a nice Airbnb in Austin and I go all out with her gifts and just an all around good experience for her. I spent probably close to $1500 on her. To show that she means the world to me. All I was hoping a kiss to be honest. I got nothing. Besides a cookbook‚Ä¶ at this point I‚Äôve lost all hope of any sort of connection/ affection. 

I know a lot of y‚Äôall are going to say I should leave her and move on, but I love her dearly and the connection with Sam is hard for me to want to leave. I will be honest and say it has crossed my minds more time than I‚Äôd like to admit these past few weeks, but I‚Äôm in between jobs. So I couldn‚Äôt leave anyways and I own her money cause job searching in my field of more isn‚Äôt east and I refuse to get paid way less. But I have and interview next week and it real promising.

Not only that but her family loves me and I love them. It‚Äôs nice to actually be apart of a family for once. 

Any advice you have for me or if you‚Äôve been through the same type of situation. What did you do? What helped you in your relationship? Any advice at this point would be greatly appreciated!

If you‚Äôve gotten this far thank you for listening to me. I appreciate it.","Oh you fucked up, you fucked up in the same way i did that lead to my divorce.

1st off you put your value of her way above your value of yourself. You need to show her that if she wants to have a loving partner then she needs to show appreciation for your effort you put in to the relationship. Nobody respects a partner that puts them on a pedastal and worships them. All you are doing is making yourself look cheap and desperate. 

1st thing 1st is to check for the cheater red flags to make sure you are dealing with a falling out of love issue and not a partner stepping out issue. Then after that you need to focus on yourself and putting that effort to making you more valueable in your own life. Not to say neglect your partner but take an unannounced break from all the ""above and beyond"" extra things you do for her. Let this new routine start for a bit then have a serious talk about the needs that must be met for this relationship to work.

You want to spoil her but that only can work if she spoils you equally. Boundries should be set, and respect should be given. And know through all this you can not force someone to love you or stay with you. The effort must come from your partner if they want you to start putting back in the effort you have previously shown. If they refuse to put effort into the relationship then there is no relationship. There needs to be a redress in the status quo or you are gonna be broken up in actions way before its verbally broken off.

For now work on yourself, observe to see if she changes once your focus is on yourself, verify cheater flags, then if she notices the change in your effort have a long talk about what is needed to go back to the way things were."

I met an Italian guy in Rome on a tinder date and within the first 2 weeks he was head over heels for me. He‚Äôd say things like, ‚ÄòI think we‚Äôre on the path of love‚Äô, and ‚Äòthere‚Äôs just something about you‚Äô and ‚ÄòI will come visit you when you go back to England the flight is only 2 hours‚Äô *sends screenshots of flight times* within the first few days. We only spent 3 days together in person and kept texting because he said please keep talking to me when you go back because I will visit. At first I was overwhelmed and found it too much, but after a few days of chatting I started to catch feelings for him. We continued to speak and FaceTime for a couple of weeks and   I had never felt so on top of the world in my life. He was my first kiss, and I was 21, But then he started replying slowly, his long texts went to just a few texts a day. I couldn‚Äôt understand bc it wasn‚Äôt like I had changed how I was with him. I could see what was happening and I broke down in tears. He told me it wasn‚Äôt that he didn‚Äôt like me, but the distance is too far. ‚ÄòIf we were closer he would have kept seeing me. yes it is right you should see somebody else, someone you deserve‚Äô. It took me a year to get over him, because I had tasted what it felt like to have somebody and I craved it so bad. My mental health is better now, so I don‚Äôt feel the need for a partner, and I can barely remember his voice. But what do you think went through his head?

He manipulated you, and you took the bullet. That's it. Love bombing is never a positive thing, you should be careful. People will use it to manipulate, intentionally or not."
dating,145vcq9,1686388204.0,"Tired of being single for so long, but options seem non-existent","I guess the best way to describe the situation for me at the moment is being tired of the same old nothing day in and day out despite very much wanting to have another person to share my life with, so I figure that by venting here maybe something will change.  


So for background I'm a 37 year old male interested in women, but it's been over a decade since I had any sort of serious relationship. The last one I had was back in college, and since then I've had a few flings, but never anything serious. And that last failed relationship was a mutual break-up as we both had past relationships that we hadn't fully moved on from at the time.  


Anyways, since then I pretty much focused on myself. I gave myself 3 requirements to dating as an adult (remember I was fresh out of college and entering the real world); get my own place, get my own vehicle and have a stable, well paying job. To some degree I always had those things, with maybe one period where I quit my job and didn't work for 2 months, but at the present I own my own home, my own vehicle and make enough money that I can do some remodeling on my home and treat myself to some nicer things (vacations, electronics, etc). But the entire time I always kept an eye out for that special someone and it's yielded nothing. I've read enough posts on here to know one of the knee-jerk reactions is for commenters to say ""you're trying too hard"" and ""the moment you stop looking is when you'll find someone"", but that's just not true. I've had several people tell me I'm not putting myself out there enough, but IMO they basically want me to seek someone desperately.   


I do try put myself out there though, I've joined social clubs and sport leagues, I regularly go to festivals and shows, and I even go to get togethers my friends host who tell me ""there's going to be a lot of single women there"", but it's all pretty fruitless. Oh, and I guess it's worth mentioning I have used 2 online dating sites as well, but for the last year at least I've basically given up on them as the people I was matched with were comically bad pairings. I never really had any dates as a result and maybe a conversation that lasted about 3 messages back and forth. And to be clear it's not that I'm being rejected, I've met plenty of women who are into me, but they are just not what I'm looking for.  


I actually think my main problem is where I live, smack dab in the center of Alberta, Canada. I grew up in rural Alberta and moved around a bit before settling near a major city, but the vast majority of people I meet fall within a few stereotypes, all of which I want nothing to do with. I don't want to go into too much specifics, otherwise I'll be here all day, but just 2 examples would people who describe themselves as country girls who ""aren't like the other girls"" because I like hunting and fishing and riding ATV's and drinking beer, or women who seem to need to form a circle of friends that their life revolves around, that gives me the feeling of a life that is more for show rather than natural. And don't get me wrong, I too like fishing, and there's nothing wrong with women drinking beer, and women having friends is fine too, but it's more that these are the things that these people choose to define themselves. I just want to find someone independent and creative and genuine that I can feel something real with. And those kind of people are out there, but I feel like at this point in time they're already married (most of the people my age are), or they run in crowds that are somewhat exclusive, or at least it seems that way because I have no clue where to meet them. I actually think my best option is trying to find someone from far away, like another country, because it seems easier to find some variation there.   


Generally I'm a happy guy, outside of this one area of my life things are pretty good, sometimes even great, but there is always that part of me that is lonely, and that loneliness gets depressing more and more often the older I get. I miss taking a girl out for a date and really doing something special to surprise them. I want to make a girl smile because she came home and I made her a fancy dinner by candlelight even though there was no occasion for it. Or snuggling on the couch while watching some schmucky rom-com she loves. And while I know this is a dating sub, I want to be a father someday as well and you kind of have to succeed in the dating part before you get to those later steps. And at this point I just have to accept that even if I had a child today I'd be almost 60 by the time they turn 18, which is just so depressing.   


So yea, I guess this is just venting, but at this point I feel like expressing this would be a change and any change would be good.","Here‚Äôs an answer you might not like to hear; you‚Äôre probably physically unattractive to most women, so while ‚Äúdating is a numbers game‚Äù makes perfect sense if you‚Äôre kinda cute, just with a kilt bit of confidence and charm you can get the attention of 1 in 5 girls or something

I guess I may be just a hopeless romantic but I would really like to be in a romantic relationship and love someone, something I‚Äôve never had before, and everything to do with the nice guy stuff just gives me doubts about myself and my dating life. I don‚Äôt want to change myself, I‚Äôve struggled with this for so long.

Anyone have any advice? Thanks in advance.","It's important not to generalize your experiences based on what you see in social media or hear from others.

It's also worth mentioning that being a ""nice guy"" is not inherently a bad thing. In fact, being kind, respectful, and a good listener are great qualities to have in a relationship. What often **becomes a problem** is when ""niceness"" is not balanced with assertiveness, setting boundaries, and showing genuine interest in the other person as an individual. Here are a few tips:

1. **Be interested:** Ask questions about her interests, opinions, and experiences. Genuine curiosity often leads to more engaging conversations.

2. **Be yourself:** Continue being respectful and kind, but also be true to your interests and passions. Don't feel like you need to hide your nerdy or dorky side. Many people are attracted to those who are passionate and knowledgeable about something, even if it's considered ""nerdy"".

3. **Be assertive:** Assertiveness isn't about being aggressive or demanding, it's about expressing your needs and wants clearly. If you want to take a relationship to the next level, don't be afraid to express that.

4. **Set boundaries:** Know your values and don't compromise them for the sake of being ""nice"". If something makes you uncomfortable, express it.

5. **Don't rush:** It might take some time to find the right person, and that's okay. Enjoy the process of getting to know different people and learning about yourself.

Remember, **it's better to be single than to be in a relationship where you can't be yourself.** Don't let the ""nice guys finish last"" narrative discourage you. There are plenty of people out there who appreciate and seek out kindness in a partner. It might take time, but you'll find someone who loves and appreciates you for who you are."
dating,145v74j,1686387692.0,How to maximize chances with crush of five years,"I've had a massive crush on a girl since I met her at university a few years ago.

She is one of the most gorgeous women I've ever known; tall, dark, has a beautiful natural smile, and she doesn't even wear makeup. She is smart, full of warmth and character, level headed, and elegant. This is quite a rare person I think.

While at university I could have sworn I saw her starting sometimes. I never asked her out in person. We had some friendly exchanges throughout uni.

This year however I did ask her if she was interested in a message, and called her, but she didn't even view the message. I didn't want to seem desparate so left it at that.

In about a month I happen to be (probably) traveling to her hometown on my own for a couple of nights for work. What's the best way forward to maximize my chances?

I know there'll be those who'll say to drop it, but I just want to give it my best go before I put this thing to bed... I don't want to give up incase there is a chance.

Thank you!","Here are some suggestions that might help you:

1. **Communication**: Try to re-establish a connection with her without directly referencing your previous message. If she hasn't seen the message, it could be due to a number of reasons, and it's important not to assume the worst. You could start with something casual, like sharing a memory from your university days, or talking about something you know she's interested in.

2. **Hometown Visit**: You could mention your upcoming trip and ask her if she has any recommendations for places to visit, eat, or things to do in her hometown. This is a non-threatening way to express your interest in her and your shared experiences. 

3. **Respect Her Space**: It's very important not to seem too eager or insistent. Give her some time to respond, and respect her personal space. Remember, no response is also a response, and it's essential to respect her choices.

4. **Suggest a Meet-up**: If she seems open to chatting and responds positively, you could suggest meeting up while you're in her town. But phrase it in a way that puts no pressure on her, something like, ""I'll be in town on these dates. If you're free and comfortable, it'd be great to catch up over a coffee."" 

5. **Be Honest and Direct**: If you feel like she's responsive and comfortable with your conversation, there might be an opportunity to express your feelings. However, be careful not to put any pressure on her. 

6. **Prepare for any outcome**: It's important to be mentally prepared for any outcome, whether she matches your feelings or not. Either way, remember that it's brave of you to express your feelings, and you should be proud of yourself for taking that step.

Remember, the most important thing is to be respectful of her feelings and decisions. Good luck!"
dating,145v19u,1686387127.0,Is this what falling out of Love is like?,"So an year and half before I(24F) lost my dad and was going through a very difficult time when I met this guy (25M). I had met him a couple of times before this but nothing serious. Ever since my father was not around anymore, he used to talk to me through entire days making sure I was doing okay. He texted me throughout the day for over a month while I was in my hometown. When I came back to the city we saw each other and we kissed. In that moment I felt so sure that he is The One for me. 
Fast forward to today, I feel he is just human. I realise my grief was so huge at the time that I would take anything that would make me feel better. He treats me good, but it's hard to have a conversation with him because we are on such different pages about everything. I have been dormant for a long time trying to heal, but now when I feel ready to go out with people, meet friends my partner doesn't think it's okay. His entire family know about me. I have been feeling that the spark has been missing for a long time. I don't know what to do or how to. Any suggestions?","I'm sorry to hear about your situation. It's a complex one, and it's okay to feel confused. It sounds like you may have originally seen this relationship as a safe harbor during an incredibly tough time in your life, which is perfectly normal. However, as you've started to heal and regain your independence, you're noticing differences that didn't seem as significant before. 

Falling out of love can be a process of recognizing that what you need and want from a relationship has changed, or that the person you're with isn't able to meet your needs. This can be gradual or sudden, but usually involves feelings of distance, disconnection, or dissatisfaction.

Communication is key here. Express your feelings honestly with him. Let him know how you've been feeling and what you want to change. You may also want to consider seeking professional advice, like a relationship counselor, who can provide guidance based on your specific circumstances.

Remember, your feelings are valid. It's okay to have loved someone for what they provided at a certain time, and it's okay to realize that they might not be the right person for you forever. It's important to prioritize your own growth and happiness."

dating,145u3qo,1686383735.0,"After many relationships, I‚Äôve learned a few things that people need to hear.","This is a little word of advice for getting to know a partner before commitment ensues. I am a 34M and been in and out of the dating world. These are the few things I‚Äôve learned in my experiences:

1) Always be patient and take your time to learn about someone. It doesn‚Äôt happen in 3 months, 6 months or even within a year. Confessing your love for someone 2 months in, love bombing and expressing that you cannot live without them will scare the living hell out of healthy personality types.

2) Expressing your traumas and fears are a part of learning someone. Always be under the understanding that not all people can handle other peoples traumas or personality traits, no matter how ‚Äúright‚Äù or ‚Äúamazing‚Äù the feelings are while being with this person. 

3) In the first 6 months, don‚Äôt push to get to know their family, friends, kids or social network. Focus on them, focus on who they are with you, what they bring to the table and how you both can mesh each others needs in a relationship. Before this is solidified, nobody should be meeting anyone‚Äôs extended social network. 

4) Learn how to communicate. Everyone communicates different and lots of people have different personality traits, which include, anxious, secure and avoidant attachment styles. In order for any relationship to succeed, both parties need to make sure they are comfortable with the way they are able to communicate their feelings, frustrations, issues and ideas to the person they want to be with. 

5) Do not try to change yourself or another person to fit the relationship status quo. They may be gorgeous, intimate, attractive, but changing your likes and personality to suit someone else‚Äôs needs or wants will end up in disaster. Be yourself, let them fall in love with who you are not who they want you to be. 

6) Do not use sex as a distraction from the issues that stem from a relationship. Sex can be amazing, you may feel this person is so attracted to you and can make you feel amazing. But, the second arguments or disagreements are put under the rug and sex is the main priority, it will blow up later on. Trust me. 

7) Most people are aware of what manipulation and toxicity is. Do not be offended if someone removes themselves from your life if you are portraying toxic behaviors or emotionally abusive tactics. 

8) Most breakups hurt the most because people fall into this cloud of ‚Äúlove‚Äù that because you love this person they would do nothing to hurt you even if they have expressed their issues with the relationship. The only way that gets fixed if you deal with the issue at hand. If one partners issues keep going undiscussed or stone walled, expect the other person to pull back due to the lack of respect when bringing up important things. 

9) Nobody is responsible for your happiness but you! If you are recognizing unhealthy behaviors when starting relationships, step back, get some therapy and love yourself before you love someone else. You will thank me. 

10) Do not stay in any relationship no matter how amazing if you feel unsafe or walking on constant eggshells no matter the reason. Life is to short to waste. 

Edit:

11) When one partner deicdes to call it quits, give each other the respect and time to heal. Even if you don't think you should be apart, time = clarity. DO NOT contact their friends, their family, or anyone on your partners side regarding your emotions or to get info on your ex. Its toxic, if you ever have a chance to get back together, this will truly destory it. 

12) Understanding why the relationship broke down is important. It helps you understand who you are, what changes to make moving forward and being grateful that you had the chance to learn from all this. DO NOT beat yourself up, FORGIVE yourself for it, because you are 1 in 8 billion in terms of humans in this world. You‚Äôre leaning, just like everyone else. 8 billion other people are also going through the same roller coaster ride and learning who they are. Be kind to yourself, be patient, there is no perfect way of doing any of this. Relationships are meant to break down, its how we get back up that makes us who we are. Love yourself. 

Hope this helps! Please add in any other points to help people out in this group.","**TL;DR:** Through my dating experiences, I've learned key relationship advice:

- Take time to know someone
- Understand that not everyone can handle your traumas
- Don't rush into meeting their social network
- Communication is key
- Don't change yourself for someone
- Avoid using sex to avoid issues
- Be aware of toxic behaviors
- Deal with issues directly in a relationship
- Remember, you're responsible for your own happiness
- Don't stay in uncomfortable relationships
- Respect post-breakup healing time
- And finally, Understand and learn from your past relationships.

Remember, you're on a journey, just like everyone else. **Love yourself first.**"

Hi, so i (23F) have a situation.
I am currently have been crushing on my co-worker (25M). Its been going on for like 6 months+. But i never wanted to date him just because we work very closely and i think it would be weird if i try to shoot my shot while being in the same company, I just think he‚Äôs a spectacular man, a good friend and just a fun guy to be around.

But recently he told us that he‚Äôs resigning from his position to pursue another job at another company and basically will be moving out of town for this new job (he‚Äôll be resigning next month).

And now he‚Äôs not going to be my co-worker anymore I feel like I should confess or at least try to get closer to him. But if we do get together it would be LDR and idk if thats good enough.

I‚Äôve heard from other co-workers that he‚Äôs also interested in me but hesitated to ask me out because of our social status.

Thank you in advance and please help","It sounds like a complex situation, but it really boils down to whether you're willing to take the risk of confessing your feelings and potentially starting a long-distance relationship (LDR).

From what you've shared, it seems there might be mutual interest, but the work situation and the potential LDR seem to be the main factors holding both of you back. Here are some things to consider:

1. **Your feelings for him**: You've been crushing on this guy for over half a year, so it's not just a fleeting attraction. Is this strong enough that you're willing to potentially enter an LDR?

2. **Mutual interest**: Rumor has it that he's also interested in you. If this is true, then your chances of getting a positive response to your confession are higher.

3. **Long-distance relationship**: LDRs can be challenging due to distance, differences in schedule, and the reduced amount of physical interaction. Are you prepared to handle these challenges?

4. **Timing**: He's about to start a new job in a new city, which can be a stressful transition. Will he be open to starting a relationship during this period?

In the end, only you can decide what's best for you. If your feelings are strong and you're willing to navigate the complexities of an LDR, it might be worth expressing your feelings and seeing where things go. Regardless of his response, at least you'll know you took a chance rather than wondering ""what if?"" later on."

dating,145taxl,1686380972.0,There are so many things wrong with me and I don‚Äôt think anyone will be able to look past it all,"Every time someone brings up one of their insecurities, people will say that there‚Äôs someone for them who won‚Äôt mind it or will even find it attractive.

Everything on me, face and body, is just shaped and placed wrong. 

So yeah, maybe there‚Äôs a guy who thinks my disgusting Neanderthal face is cute, but will he also be okay with my flat chest? And just because he doesn‚Äôt mind my stretch marks doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôll also be ok with my body acne.

dating,145slwi,1686378656.0,I feel very uneasy about the dating world.,"I have a little dillemma;

I'm fairly young (18) and I have little experience in the dating world. (I said little. I have had 2 girlfriends in my time.) I'm introverted by nature (I always have been) and I'm a little socially awkward but generally I can have a good one on one conversation with someone and I'm pretty good looking. I'd say at least above average. 

I'm not in a particularly good positon to go out and meet people at the moment considering that living in the rural midwest is kinda boring. I don't have many friends or a consistent social circle. (I don't really mind having two friends, but women for some reason like guys who have a prominent social circle.)

So as a result of this I took to the dating apps because that seems like my best option at the moment. But whenever I use the apps I get barely any matches at all. But that's not even what's bothering me the most. (compared to what I'm about to tell you it is a marginal issue because it doesn't surprise me)

My main problem is this endless swiping, and reading bios of women's profiles just to have nearly all of them blend into one another. Almost nobody sticks out, and the ones that do stick out to me are very unlikely to notice me to begin with. 

But the main issue is that most women don't stick out at all. They all like the same crappy rap and pop music I hate listening to. Alot of them think owning a cat or dog makes them special (it doesn't. 66% of the American population owns a household pet.) Not only that but they all dress very similarly and have similar phrases in their bios. (I can't even give an example, that's how forgettable they are.)

These dating apps are designed for the benefit of women rather than men. It's like they an just swipe on any random guy and instantly get them without even having to put effort in. (Hence the boring, recycled profile backgrounds)

I'm not saying mine is much better either, I'm sure my profile looks the same as a lot of other guys out there, and that is probably why I fly under the radar like most young men my age. I don't exactly impress women I'm a fairly run of the mill average guy. But these women aren't impressing me either. I swipe right on a huge majority of profiles even if they have marginal differences to one another. I do think nearly everyone deserves a fair chance, maybe these girls could be fun to hang around with, you never know. But once again, I'm not exactly impressed with most of their underwhelming choices of words. 

People lack enthusiasm in their profiles. They're all cryptic and vague, without any information on how they act being displayed what so ever. I get you have so little space to get the point across of who you are in a couple sentences and that it takes a more intimate face to face conversation to exchange more vital information on one's values, personality, and experiences but I'm not exactly getting to make any progress. 

I know I'm young and have alot of time to figure this stuff out. Also being 18 is the worst age to date because I'm still too immature for most women older than 19. But I'm still uneasy about what's to come in the future considering I have bad anxiety and have difficulties approaching people. (Which will be solved with time and experience. But I need to start soon if I'm going to make any progress and dating apps aren't exactly making it easier.)

I'd join a club but I'm unemployed and have no car. (Soon to change, I have an interview coming up in the next couple weeks. I'm confident I'll get the job because I'm prepared to give them a ton of good reasons why I need the job.)

Idk. If I could have some words of wisdom from you older folks or just someone to reassure me that I should keep going my own way for now and not sweat it so much. I'm a bit lonely and I need a little bit of humanity to cheer me up.",
dating,145skzm,1686378579.0,Anyone have experience in feeling guilty for having sex after breakup,"My husband of 13 years and I separated a few months ago.

It was absolutely incredible, the first man that has touched me in 13 years and it was amazing. He made orgasmed multiple times, something that I hadn‚Äôt experienced in a long time with my ex.

dating,145s7ic,1686377320.0,Huge red flag?,"



Hi all,

I'm (F31) together with my partner(M35) for 2 years now. When we argue, I want to talk things out. He shuts down/ignores me (over text, we don't live together). He can ignore me for 2 days.

Today I found out that he ignored his mother for a full week!! She started to cook his favourite meal to get things okay again, but he refused to eat it. 

It's like his mother wants to do everything to get things right again. 

I was thinking today and I'm thinking of breaking up with him.  If we have a problem, I want to talk it out with him. He can't,  instead he ignores me. He does the same to his mom for a full week!!! I will be like his mom one day, getting ignored for a full week. Such a disrespect.

Am I overreacting for wanting to break up? This is a huge red flag imo. Ignoring your mother for a full week!!!!?","It will only get worse unless he commits to do the extremely demanding hard work of changing. Being shut out like that when you have valid concerns to raise is kind of like being emotionally abandoned by your partner. I definitely wouldn‚Äôt want to sign up for that. If he‚Äôs willing to truly work on it and improve/grow, I would be open to seeing how things go."

dating,145ru5x,1686376089.0,Confused guy in need of advice,"So about a month ago I got this girls number (both 18). After texting a bit I invited her to come fishing with me. Btw this is something that is totally in her wheelhouse and she enjoys it. Nothing romantic or anything. She said she wasn't ready to be in a relationship and she could see it going that way. She could have been just letting me down easy but what comes next makes me wonder. Told her I respected that and it was fine, just assumed we were done talking. Well 2 weeks later I saw her and her family at an event. Apparently her mom told my mom that she wasn't comfortable in a 1 on 1 setting, but she would hang in a group. So it's not completely off the table?

Im confused because there has been multiple times she could have turned me down. When I asked for her number she could have said no, but she told me to ask her dad. She could have told her dad to deny me, but he told me I was good. She said no to a date but then comes back and still wants to hang out. We started talking again and it's like we never stopped.

dating,145rtit,1686376024.0,My (F22) boyfriend (M37) is on a work trip and it doesn't seem like he plans on contacting me the entire time. Should I be concerned?,"I‚Äôm gonna try to keep this as brief as possible but basically he flew overseas yesterday for a work trip. I honestly have no idea what the nature of the trip is, I assume it‚Äôs some kind of conference? He‚Äôs at a pretty high level in the agency he works for. Please don‚Äôt ask how I know the trip is legitimate, I‚Äôm not willing to say why on here as it can probably give him away and I know he frequents reddit. 

Anyway, he hasn‚Äôt spoken to me pretty much since the night before last. I keep telling myself he‚Äôs probably insanely busy so that would be why, jet lag, etc etc and you know, just doing whatever he needs to. Which is fine. Though I figured he would‚Äôve texted me when he landed at least, or just before he boarded, one of the two (the flight is 6hrs btw). And another thing, the last thing he texted me that one night gave me the impression that he genuinely might not plan on speaking to me at all for the entirety of his time there, which is a week. 

Am I being too needy? I don‚Äôt expect to text as frequently as we do when he‚Äôs here of course, but I thought I‚Äôd at least get some updates even if eons apart. I‚Äôm getting the impression that he might not speak to me for this whole week span, if that were the case, would that be reasonable to be concerned about?

And again, I really do understand his circumstances. If I were in another country and for work no less, I imagine I‚Äôd be way too preoccupied to contact anyone much. So I get that. And I‚Äôm not even after full on conversations of course for that reason. Even just a one sentence update or something would be good even if a day apart. Am I being unreasonable? Perhaps I am, please let me know.","Hey! Yeah I think that is something I would be worried about if I were you, particularly because there‚Äôs such an age / power gap between the two of you. Like another poster said it doesn‚Äôt take long to send a text if someone is in your thoughts and you care. I would worry given the age dynamic that he is being deceptive because he thinks you may be naive enough that it‚Äôll work.

I kept going back since because her smile and her eyes were just super pretty and there was just something about her that gave me butterflies (I haven‚Äôt felt butterflies for anyone in years). I saw her again today, and I told myself I‚Äôd try to get my foot in the door at least. So I asked her for her number, and told her she had the prettiest smile. She told me she was sorry, she already had a partner, but thanked me for complimenting her, telling me I had a cute smile too, and then told me shooting my shot like that was very attractive. They had forgotten to charge me for my drink, and I told her this, so you know what she does? She pays for my meal. I was flabbergasted, told her she didn‚Äôt have to do that for me. She told me it was fine, and the rest of the time I was there, she just kept smiling at me with a certain kind of warm look in her eye.

dating,145rlpi,1686375266.0,How to date again after heartbreak?,"I‚Äôve (25M) dated a lot of women. Never really fell in love with anyone until I met this girl in the second half of 2022. She broke my heart in January of this year. That‚Äôs a story for another day. 

But the point is, this person forever changed my perspective. I was in love with her. She made me want to have kids, she made me smile when she ate her meals, It was never sex that I craved with her, I just craved holding and cuddling with her sweet and gentle self. Etc etc, all the love. 

Now with that being said, how in the hell am I supposed to date again? I am constantly disappointed by people I meet in dating apps, Instagram, and in person. People never seem to want anything serious, the entitlement is through the roof, and nobody can even come close to matching the energy I felt with my past girl. I‚Äôm not even trying to compare, it‚Äôs just hard to when I know what perfection is, you know? 

And also another issue. I can‚Äôt even have sex anymore. Like seriously. Pre-heartbreak, I was all for casual sex, but nowadays, I think of it is as my most vulnerable asset that I don‚Äôt want to give away unless it‚Äôs to the right person. After my heartbreak, I tried to mess around with multiple girls to get over her, but I found myself crying myself to death afterwards. Which was another telltale sign that I was really in love. 

Needless to say, the last person I had sex with was in March. It was a close friend of mine (as opposed to just a fwb or hookup) and it just felt right in the moment. But when I was close to finishing, she had me look in her eyes, and then I finished, and then I excused myself to the bathroom and cried again. That‚Äôs when I legit realized that I‚Äôm just so mentally fucked from this girl and I just legit cannot have sex. 

You see, I want a girl so bad that I can just share life with, and yet I just can‚Äôt see to bring myself to do it. I‚Äôm trying so hard to forget about her, but the world just doesn‚Äôt want me to do for some reason. 

What can I do to move on? I‚Äôm distracting myself by working 65+ hours a week, I have my own place, I‚Äôm in nursing school. I eat healthy. I go to the gym. But I‚Äôm still stupidly lonely and sad. Yet I am disappointed by most of the dating market‚Ä¶ what to do?

TLDR: How can I date again after my my favorite girl?

These are all men in their early 20s, it‚Äôs same with everyone we would start making out they would be mind-blown by me (I consider myself good looking I have always gotten compliments and many guys) so these guys will shower me with compliments like you‚Äôre so pretty, sexy, beautiful etc‚Ä¶ Boom! they can‚Äôt keep erection and end up doing a mediocre job, they remain semi-hard so basically not even proper sex at that point.

dating,145qz9z,1686373195.0,I (18F) drunkenly kissed a girl (17F) and she says she felt forced?,"Hello everyone, I (18F) am traveling right now, and am on my way back home soon. I just broke up with my first boyfriend (he was my first everything), and I was honestly sort of semi-open to rebounds on my trip.
The issue comes when I was hanging out with a girl (17F) that I met through a mutual hobby. She invited me to hang out and dance/drink with her friends in a park together, and so I went and got a little too messed up. 
I kissed her friend, but quickly realized that I was not into him so I turned him down and he was very respectful about it. I was still upset about kissing someone other than my ex, so the two girls (one of them being the one I kissed), went off to leave, and ended up talking about how it was okay that I was moving on from my ex boyfriend. 

This is where it gets weird, I was alone with the girl since her friend had to leave, so we tried to get food and eventually started to make out. I was still very very drunk at this time, and she asked me how people kiss in a certain way, so I offered to show her and she accepted. It led to basically making out for half an hour, in a situation where I was drunk still and she was completely sober. It was okay, but I regret it even without what she said, so I was already feeling strange about it. 

Today she texted me and said that she felt I forced her into it, and that she was uncomfortable but did not know how to say no. She also said she was trying to push me away a bit, but at the time she was kissing me back, so it confuses me that she was apparently doing that. Also that she did not know how to say no, and that it was sort of her fault she gave me the wrong idea, and that she regrets it. 

The main part of why I am so thrown off, is that I asked her explicitly if she was okay with things I was doing, and she said yes. I specifically asked her for consent while we were kissing, and each time she said yes, and I was drunk and unable to realize that her yes was secretly a no??? She says she did not know how to say no, but I feel like since she was sober, there were many opportunities when I specifically asked her if I was ok or not to touch her or kiss her, where she said a clear yes. She is the third person I have ever kissed, first girl, and I don‚Äôt really know where to go from here. 

I texted her in response that I regretted it but that I wished she said no when I asked her if it was okay, instead of being enthusiastic with kissing me and saying yes. I am so weirded out that I went past someone‚Äôs boundaries, but at the same time am sort of upset that she said yes to things and went along with it, especially with the parts she said she was uncomfortable with. I know for a fact I asked if it was okay to touch her, to which she said yes and she was touching me too, and I just feel so uncomfortable. 

She knew I was very drunk the entire time as well, which just makes me feel even stranger personally, especially as I would assume that since she was completely sober, she could‚Äôve said anything other than yes when I asked for her consent. If she had said something, anything, I would‚Äôve stopped, I just can‚Äôt understand why she accepted my requests for consent and kept going with me if she felt the way she did this morning about it. 

What do I do from this point? I regret it so much even without knowing that she felt like that (kissing anyone honestly so soon after my breakup), but now I regret it even more with her telling me she didn‚Äôt want it. I just can‚Äôt understand, since I asked for consent and got the green light. She seems to regret it too at the least, and I asked if she was okay/mentally stable after it and she says yes, it just weird me out. 

Any advice would be appreciated, thank you for reading :(


TLDR: I drunkenly kissed a sober girl (3rd kiss in my life), and she feels I pressured her into doing uncomfortable things (touching her and kissing) after the fact. She says she did not know how to tell me no, but I feel upset because I specifically asked for consent multiple times, and do not know why she would say yes and then tell me I forced her into what we mutually (?) agreed to. Am so confused right now.","Listen what you did was fine. You asked and she said yes. The truth is, after she thought about it, she feels embarrassed and maybe even uncomfortable with her choices. You did nothing wrong and you certainly didn‚Äôt take advantage or anything like that. You did the right thing by asking if she was ok with it. Anything after that is her responsibility to speak up."

We run in the same concert going/small town bar crowd. Well neither of us hit the bar too much anymore. It‚Äôs just where we met. 

Anyways I‚Äôve had two pretty toxic relationships. One was very physically abusive and the other was just extremely neglectful and I thought it was normal because he wasn‚Äôt hurting me. 

Bob and I have been texting pretty consistently for the last 6 months and hung out a few times. I‚Äôm a single mom and he works a ton. We both were supportive during a break up. Recently he told me that he adores me and would like to know if I‚Äôd be open to him taking me on an actual date and see where things go. I am 100% down. Well tomorrow we are seeing each other for the first time since then and I am going with him to a family cook out. 

I‚Äôm extremely nervous and kind of trauma dumped all my baggage, because I don‚Äôt know how to date the nice normal guy. I apologized and said sorry if that was too heavy and he said it was a lot and it was heavy, but not too much and asked if I had ever had someone in my corner, because now I do. I‚Äôm worried he is regretting inviting me to this event now, because anxiety is a jerk and I am nervous in a way I have never been because now it is known we both have feelings towards each other.

I had always been an introvert, someone who had found peace in being by his lonesome, away from the chaos of socializing with people to whom I had no idea if their feelings and thoughts of me were manipulations or genuine. To think I would type this out, ever, only goes to show me how much I've grown desperate...or perhaps how much the attempts of finding your dream beloved have begun to wound me.

Now, I find myself unable to just stomach the rejections, the silence, the loneliness that taunts me whenever I have to see those around me flourish and bloom with the treasures they seek. I just can't. I care little of those that'll tell me ""you're still too young"" to worry about love, because rest assured, my youth has been nothing less than absolute pain, constant manipulation and depression, and an all around shroud of sadness that I'll never shake from. I've nowhere been out of the darkness yet, so don't you dare assume that I am having it lovely and that I'm just a misguided youth. 

I hear it is fine to live a life alone, without love or affection or even a partner. Yet, it always seems to be shunned or made fun of, like there's this stigma towards it.

So me and this girl go to same college or did as I am transferring now. We knew of eachother for almost 8 months but never got really close despite hanging within a group of friends a couple of times. I had not seen her in a few months but run into eachother last day of semester. We talked hanged out that day and continued to text over the next week. I ask her out and she agrees.

  
First Date goes amazing. One more week of texting and second date happens, goes okay not as good as first though. Both lasted around 5 hours with multiple places included. We plan our third date for Yesterday and continue texting throughout the week leading up to the date. This texting she seems way more into it and enthusiastic than normal which was a good sign to me.

  
As you know the Canada fire happens, and NYC gets killed with smoke and makes the outside unbearable. While texting I bring up the fact of the weather as our date was for an outdoors event offer to go somewhere else or reschedule if the even is canceled. She says she‚Äôs unsure about our date tomorrow because of the weather and we agree to check tomorrow how it is. So tomorrow happens, (The day of date) and we text in the morning as usual and I ask her what she was thinking of the weather and that I could go today or wait for the weekend if she felt uncomfortable. She doesn‚Äôt respond to that for 4 hours and the time of the date is coming up shortly, so I double text to tell her we should go during the weekend as the air quality is still bad unless she‚Äôs not free then we‚Äôll go today and to let me know if we‚Äôre still going today as the event is an hour away from me so I could start making my way there.

  
Doesn‚Äôt respond until she gets off work which was around the time I was supposed to meet her, that she‚Äôs so sorry and that she got busy at work and that she‚Äôll let me know for what day during The Weeknd. I responded with a heart reaction and to just let me know and that any day of the weekend would work. This morning we texted as usual I don't bring up the date at all but we text really chill briefly and a she seemed into it for the most part but did not mention anything however I ended it shortly.

  
At this point I am pretty sure she is not going to let me know anything. Should I just cut all contact with her? We usually daily text with me initiating it most of it? Im either thinking of texting her through the week like normal and try to set up another date. Or just stop initiating contact and in a week or so text to see her energy.","I would move on honestly.

dating,145ov8p,1686366406.0,Did I sleep around too much? (20-something man),"TL,DR: I'm worried that the amount of people I've slept with, and the habits I've developed, are gonna screw me over in the long run. Also, might have screwed up a new love interest.

&#x200B;

I'm totally gonna get flamed for this, but I'm still gonna post because I don't have a lot of advice-givers in my life rn. So to start, I'm a 20-something dude who's about a year out of a 5ish year relationship. To cope, I slept around a lot last fall. It's been 23 people I think, and I've picked up the douchebag attitude. For the past few months I've stopped mostly. I'm worried that I've solidified myself as a player because I'd never lie to a SO about my history, and the question will always come up. (FYI, always safe, no STDs)

Anyways, some advice about the above would be appreciated. Maybe some stories of past players finding love and losing the casual life?

&#x200B;

Now for the regret part. I'm not asking for sympathy or judgement here, I know what I did was dumb as hell. I guess it's just an example of my new behavior, which I'll now be working on weeding out of me. So I've been talking to a girl for a little over a month. We've kept in touch, but I had to leave for the summer (quite a ways away, think half a country lol) so I decided to wait until we had the exclusivity talk until after, because we need more time to build feelings. 

Anyways, I wound up convincing myself that because we're still in the ""talking stage,"" I should go get some hookups out of my system to solidify my transition into being monogamous again (stupid). Got hit up by someone on my socials, turns out she kinda knows my love interest sort of, I don't think they keep in touch though. She has an open relationship bf, so I knew it'd be a casual FWB type thing with no feelings. We slept together (VERY stupid), and now I'm paranoid my love interest found out and is gonna find me sleazy. To be fair, I have bad OCD and I could be making a mountain out of a molehill. But we're definitely not ""just in the talking stage."" My love interest and I haven't had sex yet. We probably could have, but I wanted to wait and have it be special. Still though, we've hugged and snuggled and done cute stuff. I feel so filthy for seeking casual stuff. So genuinely wrong of me.

Regardless of whether or not she hears about it, or whether or not we work out, I know this isn't the kind of behavior I wanna continue doing in the future. It's so immature, I need to stop hooking up especially when I'm emotionally interested in someone. I'd never cheat after the official exclusivity talk, though. Stating that firmly with 100% confidence.

Also, just for good measure, GOD I'm dumb. So damn stupid. Thoughts and advice is welcome.","If she were to find out oh well. You guys weren‚Äôt even offical yet. For all you know she could have been doing the same thing as you. So dont feel bad. Bro you‚Äôre 20 something , you‚Äôll have alot more potential love interest down the line.

Then after a couple months (2-5) all of a sudden with no change from me, they just stop, and start acting really weird towards me like I did something wrong, always telling me they're busy, some of them even straight up block me on social media literally less than 24 hours after telling me how much they like me, but the second I address them on it and letting them know if theyre not into it anymore its totally fine and they can let me know they always give me a reason they never tell me they arent into it anymore.

Especially with the constant contact and future plans to move in after only dating a couple months. Those are red flags. But they don't genuinely like you as a long-term partner so it fades after a short while because it was never really there. And it's not that unusual even for people you've been close friends with for 10 years. I would say it's more expected in those situations. It's more unusual for romantic feelings to develop after being just friends for so long. It happens all the time in movies but a lot less often in real life."

One cheating ex, few horrible things said, long story short I was a mess and single for the first time in awhile. I took a year to work on me. I knew I needed to work on myself and fall in love with my life again. I spent time with my family, friends, and went to therapy. 

Finally I felt like I was able to get back out there. I joined the apps, was not shy of matches but conversations either never went past the initial message or just died in general. No problem, so I turned to meeting people out. Actually met who I thought was a nice guy out, we talked for a couple weeks planned a date, day comes and I was ghosted. Slight ego blow but I took some time, hopped back on the apps and it was all the same bs as before so I found myself deleting them. Last month, met a guy at my gym. We talked, things seemed great, tried to plan a date but the timing wasn‚Äôt really working out that week so he totally gave up. Stopped responding to my messages and stopped coming to the gym. I‚Äôve now returned to the apps and I‚Äôm not meeting anyone worthwhile. I‚Äôve sent plenty of likes, no responses. People I do match with don‚Äôt respond.

dating,145o89p,1686364462.0,Women of Reddit,What are some things you wish men did more or less of in bed?,"Obligatory am Man, but....

Some comments you'll get from women on this topic are:

1. Be more vocal. Even grunts and ""oh fuck"" will go along way. You dont have to have a monologue prepared, but complete silence is less fun. Women like feeling desired and having the man give in to his impulses and let out a few gasps tells her everything she needs to hear. 

2. Help her finish. Seriously, the amount of men that dont do this is staggering. If you get off, she gets to get off too. And youre sort of obligated to help her get there even after you're done. Oral, toys, fingers, etc. Tons of different ways even if your member downstairs is tired.

3. On the topic of toys. Toys. Tons of men hate bringing out toys like dildos and vibrators because it makes them feel less competent. Men who are secure in their masculinity and understands the usefulness of a vibrating wand will unlock a womens heart a lot easier than just using your stick. The toys arent because you are lacking, they are there to enhance the good you already have. Most women love toys, if she has some and are used to it - learn to use them on her.

4. Communicate. Seriously. Just ask her what she likes and how she likes it. Every person (read: women) is different. Some like direct stimulation, some dont. Some like more rough, some like slow and passionate. Ask your women to communicate exactly what she wants and exactly what you can do to make the experience the best for her. Bonus if you ask her to masturbate in front of you if she's comfortable with that. Good way to watch and observe exactly how she does it.

5. Foreplay. This goes hand in hand with communication, but its safe to assume she wants foreplay. 90% of women do, probably more like 99%. Tease her with your words and your hands. Dont just instantly go to pound town or instantly go to her sensitive areas. Whisper in her ear, cuddle, touch and rub your hands around all the other areas. Her arms, hands, legs, neck, back, etc. Then slowly build it up to boobs, butt and vagina. Even then keep building. Lick her thighs and tease her clit. Do this until shes pressing her pelvis into you because she cant take it anymore. Then you go to town. Usually oral to penetration is a safe bet especially if you dont last long. 

And finally the zeroth rule you should never ignore:

Zero: Have fun! Seriously. If you have fun and want her to have fun, you cant go wrong."
dating,145o3eg,1686364050.0,What do you do to pick yourself up and keep trying?,"Recently, I (23M) had been dating a woman (22F), and it looked as though all signs were pointing to a relationship. She was pretty much everything I could want in a woman. Smart, beautiful, funny, outgoing, ambitious, the list goes on. We had great conversations, we went on fun dates, we both embraced getting to know each other, and we had even verbally communicated that we were interested in seeing what the long-term future could hold for us.

Well, turns out the long-term future didn‚Äôt have much for us lol. About a week and a half after we had the ‚Äúintentions‚Äù talk, she decided that she didn‚Äôt want to proceed anymore because she just wasn‚Äôt feeling a romantic physical attraction to me. Not gonna lie, I was a bit hurt, but I told her I understood her decision and I appreciated her communicating that with me.

I‚Äôm looking ahead to the future with the lessons I learned from our time together. Through all of this, though, one question remains consistent: how do I get the courage to try again?

I ask this because I‚Äôm honestly afraid of having to meet a brand new person, get to know them, open up to them, spend a lot of time with them, and then I end up getting disappointed all over again when I think things are trending in a relationship direction. I don‚Äôt want to expose myself and end up crushed again.

To this point, I‚Äôve still never been able to get into a relationship. I know I‚Äôm young and there‚Äôs plenty of life to live, but I‚Äôm just curious to know how other people in this sub continue to have the courage to not give up and to keep trying. Time heals all wounds, and once I've taken some time away from dating, I'll give it a go again at some point. I‚Äôm ready to try and take that next leap in my dating life, but I just haven‚Äôt been able to meet someone who wants to stick around.   
","I have an ex coworker who has been hurt 3 or so times who now tentatively rejoins dating apps but doesn't give it her all, saying that guys are all the same and it always ends in hurt. She doesn't put in full effort and sabotages things out of fear from her potential rejection. She's smart, pretty, successful, has a lot going for her in life. Deep down I can tell she does want something meaningful but is in limbo between picking herself up and giving up. 

Meanwhile a good friend of mine has been through both positive and negative dating experiences who knows that persistence and courage is key. If you experience a loss or get ghosted or something like that, take it as it is and keep searching. You open yourself up to the possibility of something positive in future. Try to have fun as you go, learn and improve in your interactions. You will meet someone who shares the same intentions as you and will appreciate your openness and transparency.

My first instinct is to always get tested for stds before becoming intimate with someone. But obviously if they are looking to be spontaneous and hookup at like a bar or club or something, there ain't no time for that.

I called him out on it multiple times and he said he didn‚Äôt realize but has not fixed it. I tried holding his hand to pace better, but he felt really uncomfortable holding my hand in public. I justified that by the fact that this is still new and he‚Äôs never dated anyone before. We‚Äôre both college aged if that matters.

dating,145n1vc,1686360954.0,Dating on Easy Mode -- Relatable?,"I'm very fortunate that I happen to be attracted to fat women as a young, fit guy in the American South.

I sometimes feel like an asshole for taking advantage of this cheat code. If I were designing an ideal society, I certainly wouldn't single out some group of people to have (on average) lower standards and self-esteem for any reason.

For context: Been talking to this guy at work daily for 2 months and our conversations have honestly made my day better every time. Slowly the conversations got slower which I‚Äôm totally fine with cause I know he‚Äôs very busy at work and I‚Äôm not pushy at all. Then he just stops replying or initiating the conversations by that I mean, he stopped asking me questions and his replies are always dead, which ultimately made disinterested.

OH and I forgot to mention, when he‚Äôs busy and he says he‚Äôll get back to me in 2 days time, he really will get back to me then which I greatly appreciate so I though he valued our conversation but I guess not?","In your particular situation its really not that complicated, Ive literally been that guy.  

Basically he saw you as a romantic prospect, reasoning being you shared numbers, most men dont share numbers with women they're not interested in romantically.  

Then he made the calculation it likely wasnt going anywhere and decided to cut his losses full stop and save himself from embarassment.  In my own tale I didnt quit my job but happened to get transferred but everything pretty much lines up with your guy.  

&#x200B;

>So why do men do this?

 To save time and emotional bandwidth.  If we see its likely not gonna happen it crushes some guys spirit so to have to see you again is just salt in the wound so its better to exit with no fuss to pick yourself back up.  

Sure it sucks but your guy wanted to spare himself asking if you felt similar when her already knew the answer.

I (20m) work at a hatchery for the summer. We do many different things throughout the summer. For example we house clams and oysters for non profit organizations and for other projects. If no one needs them we plant them in the bay (dumping them in the water). We also clean the clams and oysters because they can get very dirty very fast if you aren't keeping up with them.  
Issue:  
A few days ago we had a non profit organization come to collect 75 bags full of oysters and 15 liters of clams. Anyway when they arrive there is this girl that is with this group. She and a few others are collecting the bags that they needed while I collect their clams. Afterwards we all gather around to discuss about oysters and stuff. There is about 8 of us 3 being around my age and 3 being 50 or above. During the discussion I caught the girl checking me out. I was also checking her out. We were looking at each other more than listening to the conversation. The conversation finishes and we all shake hands with each other. They leave and I don't know if I will ever be able to see her again and I feel like I should have said something to her but I didn't because my boss was right next to me and I didn't think it was appropriate at work.

dating,145jzp3,1686352537.0,Guy spent a year and a half maintaining correspondence with me despite having no interest in me romantically or platonically?,"I'm sorry in advance for the length!

I (36F) met this guy (33M) last year when he reached out to me on social media. We'd followed each other for a while but had never interacted. We hit it off and when we found out we lived close to each other he said we should meet up when the weather got nicer. We continued talking for a few months, he asked me lots about myself, remembered everything I told him, he was upfront about the fact that he was attracted to both women and men, I was cool with that, and eventually we met up. First meeting was pleasant, if not a bit awkward, as we both have anxiety. When we parted, he said he would be going on vacation soon. He surprisingly kept in touch with me the entire time he was gone. After he came back, we hung out again. Touch barrier was broken this time (first by me, later by him). However, the day after he went quiet. Alright...

A week or so later I suggested we hang out again, but he said was ill. Okay. A couple weeks later I asked if he wanted to do something for his birthday, and he said he was in the middle of quitting his job and he was too burnt out to meet. Okay. He was spotty with communication over the next couple months but had assured me our rapport ""would be back"". He said his burnout had really affected him.

A bit of background info on him: this is a guy with bad anxiety, low self-esteem (by his own admission), who has trouble emotionally connecting to and talking about feelings with others (by his own admission), represses emotions (by his own admission), has vaguely alluded to experiencing numerous traumas, and is working through complicated grief over the death of a parent in 2021.

I casually, kind of jokingly admitted I had a crush on him in December when we were chatting one day. He didn't respond to that...but immediately became a lot more lively and a bit flirty after I did. However, over the winter we almost stopped talking entirely. I figured that was that. Around March though, he resurfaced and the communication became a lot more frequent. He was super playful and quite chatty, back to teasing me a lot. I didn't want to broach the topic of hanging out again, though. So we're just texting this entire time. Still, he showed concern for me when I mentioned having some issues with people (telling me he'd go after them for me), offering to send me poems he'd written when I told him I would secretly love it if someone wrote me a poem (he sent them), asking about why previous relationships of mine hadn't worked out, telling me he felt close to me, sending me links to and pictures of things I was interested in, etc.

One day I told him that I felt we kept our dynamic superficial deliberately because we're both very guarded people and it's hard for us to be vulnerable. He said he agreed and that we both have ""an awareness of it (our dynamic) going deeper"". Eventually he began broaching topics about sex (never anything hardcore; he was always very respectful and careful), and one night, apropos of nothing mentioned that we'd never had sex (as if I didn't know this?). Yet we're not sexting or anything. It's just banter. 

Another day we're chatting and I say, ""Ya know, sometimes I think we care about each other more than we're willing to admit."" No answer. BUT--and I apologize for the sheer tween cringe of this--about an hour later I check my Twitter account and there are a dozen notifications from him having liked and retweeted posts of mine, all immediately one right after the other. These were posts I'd made over the course of the week, so he deliberately went to my page to do this. It's not like he was scrolling through the day's timeline and just casually liked a bunch of stuff I tweeted. And while we initially became acquainted through Twitter, we do not interact with each other's pages because we just text. I don't think he's interacted with anything I've tweeted since last year. 

Two weeks ago I casually brought up hanging out now that summer's around the corner. Nothing implied. He immediately changed the subject.

Okay, so. A few nights ago I had an intimate dream about him. When we were talking a couple days later he said he had a ""weird"" dream about me the previous night. I said I'd had a weird dream about him too. His dream involved me dating a friend of his and showing him pictures from a vacation we'd taken. He asked what my dream was about and I said we'd just hung out. The next day I playfully asked him if I'd made any appearances in any more of his dreams and he asked if he'd been in mine. I went, ""Ha, I wish"". Then I mentioned I'd left some details out of my account of my dream the day before. He asked what I left out. I said I didn't want to say what but he wanted to know and wouldn't let it go. I was coy but he could obviously tell what it was and kept insisting I tell him. He guessed that it had been a sex dream. When I said yes he said, ""Just because I'm not romantically interested in you doesn't mean I find that weird.""

We spoke about this for a bit. I told him it wasn't cool that he hadn't been upfront with me about not being interested in me, especially when he knew I was attracted to him. He said he knew it was shitty and apologized repeatedly. He did the whole, ""I try to be a good person, but I fuck up a lot, I'm sorry"" spiel.

So...I don't understand this at all. Why spend a year and a half forging this connection with me when he clearly had no intention of having it go anywhere? Like at all? Him saying he feels close to me and yet not even wanting to hang out platonically seems bizarre. I hang out with friends I have no romantic interest in all the time. I assume he does as well. I could have understood if he'd been using me to get his rocks off on the side, but that was never even a thing; we never sexted or hooked up. Why resurface after a season of not talking to me if there's nothing there? He told me he wanted me around many, many times. Yet at the same time he kept his distance. Plus, he has tons of friends and an active social life, so it's not like he needed my friendship because he was desperate for someone to talk to. And pushing me to tell him about the sexual aspects of my dream about him seems so strange. I certainly wouldn't spend a day pushing a friend to tell me about a sex dream they had about me, especially if I wasn't into them.

tl;dr: Guy spent a year and a half fostering a connection with me and dangling the prospect of something deeper only to tell me he's not interested in me immediately after getting me to tell him about a sex dream I had about him.",This sounds like a platonic friendship on his end. Which is a great thing! You don't have to be interested in someone sexually in order to enjoy their company.
dating,145js7l,1686352006.0,Cute guys with dogs üò≠,"I feel like a shitty person for this but I‚Äôve had such bad experiences in the past with dogs and even from owners that say ‚Äúthey don‚Äôt bite‚Äù that I don‚Äôt even want to be around them.  I have had a couple dates where the dog would come to me for a kiss or two on the hand  and then leave me alone which was fine and I would even warm up to them to even pet them.  But then I‚Äôve had the bad experiences where I‚Äôm bleeding and being attacked by a dog while the owner(my date even) does absolutely nothing about it and then blames me for it.  I‚Äôm completely terrified of dog bites too because of all the stuff they get into. Went on another date and he assured me he had the best dogs and within 5 seconds of meeting the dog it jumps up and bites my hand as I was trying to shield my self.  Spent the rest of the date with the dog jumping on me as I tried to deflect blows and then later on he says that the dog loved to hunt mice and kills/eats them all the time. I spent a week after that date worries of all the diseases I could‚Äôve contracted and I have bad anxiety. 

Finally had enough and started telling guys before I meet them that they needed to lock up the dogs if I was coming over. This didn‚Äôt go over well and I ended up making him very upset. I don‚Äôt want dogs jumping on me or possibly scratching or biting me anymore while I‚Äôm trying to enjoy a date.

I'm 99% sure my ex-boyfriend has changed his number because of my constant phone calls at the end. Also blocked me on any form of social media.  I know there may have been no excuse for my behavior, but the reason he couldn't handle it was due to my major depression and sucidal ideations that I was currently having (it is much bigger than him, struggled way before he came into the picture).  I just couldn't pull myself out of it with his advice and he gave up on me.  And the last time we talked, he said some very hurtful things.  I shut down when I am attacked or confronted in anyway.  I just got my thoughts together and wanted more closure.  But he won't give that to me.  I am making a major step, and through this I decided to start ketamine infusion therapy for my treatment resistant depression and sucidal ideations.  So, I guess this was a wake up call and a silver lining.  But even with the so very hurtful things he said at the end, I still love him.  And just wish he was around in some compacity.

In my early, rapidly coming up on mid 30's, havn't really ever done the dating scene and I'm honestly fine with that, but i have a friend who really seems to be stressing over finding companionship. I don't think he'll do dating apps, I really don't think he would be someone to do the club scene, and I've seen comments saying that we're starting to get to the age where clubs might be a bit of a weird location for us anyway... Thing is the only way I see him finding a relationship that works, is to get out there and talk to/interact with single people our age, and the only way is see this happening right now, is if i start dragging this person to those places...

dating,145ii5e,1686348801.0,Feeling like I‚Äôm being used by others,"Hi, I‚Äôm a 20 year old male who is currently attending university. I have been feeling like this for a while but recently it has gotten to me more because of a situation that has happened to me a couple of days ago. I am in a society at my university. There‚Äôs this girl I really like who is also in this society. One night we were going out as it was the last social we were having together as a society. So I decided I should tell her how I feel before it‚Äôs too late. I manage to get her to walk with me alone and I tell her. She says that she feels the same way and asks why I didn‚Äôt tell her sooner. This obviously makes we very happy and we spent the whole night kissing and such (but I don‚Äôt go back to hers). We spend the whole night talking and such about how we‚Äôve liked each other for a while. She also says she‚Äôs been telling other people in the society that she liked me for a while. However she mentions of a guy that she has been talking to for a while- they‚Äôre just talking nothing official. (It‚Äôs important to note that I already knew about this). And how she doesn‚Äôt know how she feels about both me and this guy. She is also going back home over the summer and she lives very far, and neither me nor this guy would be able to visit her. She mentions this to me, and I say let‚Äôs talk over the summer and try to get to know each other. She mentions that to me and say it could be a difficulty- but she doesn‚Äôt mention the other guy she is dating and how it would also be difficult for him. Bare in mind this guy lives nearby to me, so it would also be a struggle for him. She also keeps telling me I‚Äôm very handsome and that I could date anyone in the society, and asking why I like her out of everyone there. Anyway we say goodbye and leave for the night. A couple days later again by chance I‚Äôm out and she is too. So we hook up again. I had been messaging her if she‚Äôd like to go on a date a day beforehand which she said she may not have time but she‚Äôd let me know if she did. So I ask her if she knows when she is free throughout the night as she hadn‚Äôt mentioned it since but she either changes the topic of just doesn‚Äôt reply every time i ask. After sitting with her and kissing her for a while I ask if I can go back to hers . She says no I worry and ask if I overstepped. She says no she‚Äôll explain later. So we go out and she gives the explanation: ‚Äúmy opinion is too high of you to bring you back‚Äù and then proceeds to say (somewhat believably) ‚Äúif I didn‚Äôt care about you I‚Äôd defo bring you back ‚Äú. I obviously accept, although a little jealous because a friend of hers had told me she had brought the other guy back. I tell myself maybe she doesn‚Äôt want sex to be the last time she sees me. But looking back on it I just think she was making excuses up. My mates gf also said to be careful because she might be playing me. I was also a little confused by this as she had left her housemates to be with me (on the last night they were spending together as a house). I asked if she still wanted to go on a date after a couple days of not messaging her as I hadn‚Äôt actually gotten a clear response from her she hasn‚Äôt responded when I asked her in person. She hasn‚Äôt responded yet but it hasn‚Äôt been very long. She also never really spoke to me when she was sobre just on nights out as a society. Do you think she was just using me? Any advice? Because I like her very much and this has hurt me a little.",You're more likely to get advice if you make the text easy to read by using things like paragraphs.

After a successful first date where we shared 2 rounds of coffee and a great back-and-forth on listening/talking about each other, I'm going for another date with a guy that I matched with. 

First date was on Tuesday. He hasn't stopped texting me since. We're both eager to go out and meet each other again tomorrow. 

He's such a green flag so far; he's communicative, he tells me when he has classes (I'm a postgraduate; he finishing his legal qualification) but I asked him what kind of texter he was and we've been basically texting each other back and forth. He doesn't keep the convo flirty and will change the subject without making it seem like he's not un-interested to flirt. Amongst other things...

dating,145huj3,1686347216.0,Am I a bad person?,"So I had a gf (now ex) a few months back who wouldn‚Äôt do anything sexual with me. I told her I had a high sex drive but she just didn‚Äôt care. All she‚Äôd want to do is cuddle and this would make matter worse because I would get aroused and left with blue balls almost every time. Granted she did occasionally give in but it wasn‚Äôt enough. 

I felt like she didn‚Äôt want to do it with me or she simply just didn‚Äôt enjoy it. She would claim to love it but when I‚Äôd try to bring it up later it‚Äôs like her whole demeanor changed. She‚Äôd genuinely get upset if I even brought up anything sexual. It was so confusing and there were too many mixed signals. Throughout our relationship, I had contemplated leaving but the idea of anyone else having her made me sick so I stayed. 

Eventually, another girl I knew advanced on me and we ended up kissing.  She asked to rub on me and If I wanted to rub on her titties. I stupidly agreed and later felt guilty for what I did. We didn‚Äôt have sex but the fact that I had even entertained another girl whilst still with someone was against my morals. I told her and we had split for a while. We got back together but later ended up breaking up over something else. 

I never cheated before and I sure as hell don't plan on doing it again. Something in me just couldn't let her go even though wasn't happy.

So rn I don't know how to break up with her in a way that'll let her down easy","First of all, you are not obligated to stay with someone if you don‚Äôt want to BUT the grass is not greener on the other side. You say ‚Äúnot in love anymore‚Äù so you were once in love with her. What makes you think the same thing won‚Äôt happen again with a new person after a period of time? There is ways to reignite the spark. You do you man but if you really want to get out of the relationship you have to do it sooner rather than later. You will hurt her no matter what but it takes 2 to fight for a relationship so if you don‚Äôt want to then don‚Äôt. Leading her on is probably worse than getting it over with. Either way if you break up with her and later realize you miss her and that you do actually love her and have feelings for her, you can‚Äôt go crawling back."

dating,145hhaj,1686346332.0,Is it possible to find a girl how I described in my post-breakup letter below?,"She was my bestest friend in the whole wide world, long before we even developed feelings for each other. We would talk every single day, for hours on end, and the conversation would never stop. In fact we would have to mutually agree to end the conversation, because there was no end to it.

&#x200B;

  
I would look at her and think ""It's like I have known you forever"". I knew through pure logic and not just emotion that she is very close to being my second half. The more we met, the more we wanted to, and needed to meet.   


&#x200B;

  
She was someone with whom I could be as silly, goofy, deep, weird, vulnerable, emotional etc as possible. Our conversations were literally split between us making silly noises, talking about serious topics and getting to know each other deeply. So deeply that we could answer any deep and random question about each other's life. She understood every word that came out of my mouth and instead of placing judgement, she would simply understand and reciprocate equally. We literally brought out the best in each other because we both provided each other a platform to express those parts of us. Our goofiness was unmatched, we would make funny noises together, we would make funny parodies on songs together, or even random improv based on anything around us or in the conversation. We would talk about the deepest topics of life; pros and cons of joint families, marriage, religion, spirituality, philosophy, why people do certain things, etc. She brought out every aspect of my personality out of me. And I did the same for her. 

&#x200B;

  
She matched me on almost every single thing. We had the same exact same humour, family values, moral values, relationship/marriage values, mindsets, goals, etc. We would write letters to each other in both English and Punjabi, letters expressing what we like about each other, and full of words with the intent to make each other filled with happiness. We would never allow each other to have self deprecating thoughts. A relationship built on pure quality time and words of affirmation, and there was no physical aspect to it. I saw in her the female version of myself.   


&#x200B;

  
Her personality was so endlessly deep and we knew each other so well that we would see each other in everything, everywhere. Everything and every place would make us think about each other. Maybe a random situation, an object, the environment around us - this was because we knew each other so well that we could see a part of each other in those things. For example, if I'm near a forest, I'd get reminded of her and how she loves hiking, if I see a circus, I'd get reminded of how goofy and funny she is, if I see a happy old couple, I'd get reminded of her maturity in relationships. She would do the same for me. She'd see something in her day, and if it reminded her of me, she would instantly message me. That is how close we were - we saw each other in all aspects of our lives.   


&#x200B;

  
A few of the things I really appreciated about her.   


&#x200B;

  
She made me feel so nostalgic. She reminded me of and mirrored every single stage of life I've been in. She and I had very similar experiences during the same life stages. Talking to her was literally like talking to myself while I was in those life stages. It was the most rare and surreal experience I've ever had in my life. A person who I never knew before, suddenly shows up in my life and I recognize in her, myself. Even simpler stuff like watching the same shows as me growing up, same YouTubers, similar interests, similar behaviours and habits, similar interactions with family members / friends / teachers, etc. We're even born in the same year.

&#x200B;

  
Her openness with me was more than she's been with anyone before. She would tell me stuff she has never told another soul, she would laugh at my jokes like she's never laughed before. She told me I brought out her truest and realest laugh that she had kept hidden for years. 

&#x200B;

  
Other than that, just as a short list of what I appreciated in her: the way she spoke with such love about her family, the amount of time she spent with her family, the way she would talk about her relationship with God, the fact that nothing could sway her from her morals and values ever, the way she would allow me to resurface my TRUE self, the way she gave me a platform for any thought I had, the way she was so nerdy and had all of these unique interests, the way she would speak about her desire to get married and have the happiest life with her future husband and in-laws, her modesty, her ability to make jokes on the spot and carry any joke that came her way, the way her joy and bubbly nature was simply contagious, they way she was nice to everybody out of the pureness of her heart, the way she appreciated her culture, language and religion, her perception of friendships, the fact that her personality was so wide and deep - I could start any conversation on any topic with her and the conversation would have no end to it. There are so many other things that I cannot think of right now. I am very glad that we got to spend the time we did together, and although it did not last forever, it has taught me that yes, there are people like her out there.

&#x200B;

  
Every person is rare and unique on this earth, but for me, she was the absolute most rarest person ever in this whole wide world. That is because I have never ever experienced such a strong emotional connection with any person in my life. My heart, mind and soul give the Universe a challenge: ""Universe, can you help me find another girl like her?"" And the Universe would probably respond ""Sorry that seems a bit impossible, but I'll try"". 

&#x200B;

  
I have moved on from her, and wish her all the best in her future relationship, and hope she is the happiest person ever. As for me, I hope my next relationship is with my final and life long love.

It‚Äôs always been talking stages or one sided situationships where I am always confused and I‚Äôm tired of the games and back and forth. I feel like I can get some attention but it always fades or materializes into anything more.

Start dating as early as possible. That's my advice. I'm starting to date *at fucking 22 years old*. **I'm too fucking old**. I feel like shit. Full shit. I had a lot of troubles to ask a girl out, but I'm slowly overcoming them (GOOD!). Nonetheless, I feel jealous of those who started dating at 13, 14 or younger. They're way more experienced in dating and, well, they enjoyed the dating game earlier than me. That's why you have to start dating. 

As someone recently posted, the worst part of being single is no sex. Just because you're single doesn't mean you don't get horny, so‚Ä¶ if single you're fucked up, but you're having zero sex if you don't date. Zero intimacy, zero stories, zero anything.   
You'll have more experiences, more chances of finding the one (or ones) you want, more of the world. You'll fucking LIVE.

dating,145gyib,1686345093.0,Anyone else feel like they have a perfectly amazing life minus the fact that they've had little to no success with romance?,"The effect that this seems to have is that it creates great polarity in my mood and confidence. Maybe this seems relatable?

I'm 25 and have never had a girlfriend. I've only recently come to realize that my strategy of just focusing on myself and waiting for Ms. Perfect to come along and throw herself at me is not viable. I know it seems pretty late in the game for me to only recently have come to terms with that. Now I've realized that I need to actually ask girls out when I'm attracted to them. I understand that a huge component of getting a girl attracted to you initially is confidence.

I am always working on maintaining a consistent level of confidence, making sure that I come off as strong and centered (as Coach Corey Wayne might say) and demonstrating that no matter what happens, I will be okay. 

On the one hand, I feel immensely confident in myself because I have a great life. I am in grad school on a full ride scholarship, have above average grades, and I'm relatively thin, but with noticeable bicep muscles. 

However, I have to constantly try to keep my confidence afloat when considering my lack of success with romance in the past. I try not to dwell on it, but every once in awhile it just happens. Based on how successful I am in almost all areas of my life, I feel confident that I can attract a great girl to be with, but then I also consider that I have never done so before, and it throws some doubt into the equation. Anyone else in this same boat?

I guess it's best to just remember that ""It always seems impossible until it's done"" as Nelson Mandela said.","It is common advice here that one needs to learn to live on their own before they're ready to live with someone else, that they need to love themselves and be comfortable with themselves first etc etc. And I don't disagree! But...  


I'm pretty happy with my life, I live in a fresh apartment in a beautiful town in Sweden with nature nearby, good friends, a good career on the way, a supportive family, my health is good and improving, but when I found myself in a relationship after years on my own it was like something irreplacable came into place. And when that relationship ended up not working out after some time I found myself alone again, and now I can't help but feel like even if everything else works out perfectly, I will just live 50% of a life if I'm on my own... :(  


Maybe for some people romantic relationships are just one good thing among many, interchangeable with other things. But I can't feel that way. Sadly, I also feel that the loneliness also ratchets up desperation and bitterness in a way that is not very healthy for me and not attractive to others."
dating,145gsin,1686344698.0,I was wrong about women,"I'm a 23M and I've never had a girlfriend, I don't consider myself ugly, but I'm quite an introvert and that's why I had assimilated that I will never have a girlfriend (but because I always thought that women never start a conversation). However, right now I'm volunteering in a hostel and I work with a guy about my age who is a tall, thin, Brazilian model, the fact is that I realized something, when I'm in a common room, me and another girl (a guest from the hostel) they never speak to me (or look at me, it is as if they avoid my gaze), and many times they don't even respond when I enter the room and say ‚Äúhi‚Äù, however, when my coworker is alone in the room, the girls in the room start talking to him and it's as if their face light up when they saw him.

In short, I was always wrong with women, it's not that they never start a conversation, it's that I'm ugly.

Edit: So this is why I decided to write this post, similar things have happened but today was blatant. My coworker friend and I were on a sofa talking, and there was another girl with a laptop in the same room, she didn't say a word.

Don't be afraid to be a little bold and ask a deep question about them ... If you're looking for something more serious then ask about them and get to know them... It depends on what you're looking for, but the depth of your questions will also weed out any girl who is just a floozie... I

If you want something more casual then just ask about her interests and find something superficial that you have in common that you can talk about ... if they are dry or you have nothing in common then move on. Be yourself, be honest, and have fun. If one fails, there are quite literally billions more"
dating,145fbls,1686341211.0,I haven‚Äôt felt like this in a while. Please read.,"There‚Äôs this girl (24f) I‚Äôm (29m) sort of crushing on (both in same college) because I felt like she was/is showing interest in me. She‚Äôs way out of my league and I‚Äôm sure she has many options, but it seems she is quite nice with me which is a bit rare I feel. I compare with the friendships I have with other girls. I just don‚Äôt want to confuse kindness with interest so its really difficult. Long story short, I get butterflies and can‚Äôt stop thinking about this. Been a while since I dated.

- She likes my instagram stories and occasionally commented on them
- she sends me voice messages, asks me how i was feeling when I was sick (again I feel like this might be her kindness) - but she calls or sends voice messages/texts.
- She faces me when we talk, plays with her hair, smiles, and doesn‚Äôt look at the phone too often.
- she has asked me if I‚Äôm coming to an event where she‚Äôll be at. She‚Äôs invited me 2 times over to her place to talk before going out to the club. One time by myself, the other with another dude who‚Äôs a friend. She‚Äôs excited to go to these events it seems, but she could also be the same with others.
- she‚Äôs told her mom about me
- her voice/pitch gets high and cute before she says bye to me on the phone. 
- we always ‚Äúfight‚Äù over the bill and she has always offered to pay, but I usually get it (this is a cultural thing though). But she could also not offer if she wasn‚Äôt interested despite our culture/traditions?
- in our culture, we are too nice and sometimes this can be perceived incorrectly - that‚Äôs why I can‚Äôt tell. We are both from the same country, but I was born and raised in America so my perception is skewed if that makes sense.
- I‚Äôve told her I like spending time with her and would like to get to know her better and she said she feels the same, she hugged me and said that we‚Äôd talk about it soon. But luckily, that wasn‚Äôt the end of it. She doesn‚Äôt ignore me. We just haven‚Äôt talked about it yet. What could this mean? 
- after I told her that, she came to have coffee with me and we ended up talking for 2 hours until the coffee shop closed. Before the coffee ‚Äúdate‚Äù she kept saying she wanted to go home to finish doing her chores before I told her I wanted to get to know her better, but seemed to have a change of mind after I said I was interested. So she made time to spend with me.
- I didn‚Äôt say the word ‚Äúdate‚Äù so I felt like it was implied. I asked her out to have lunch with me, she said yes, I also asked her to walk with me, and she also said yes (but seemed like she also had some shopping to do for a friend so we did that together). We‚Äôve done a decent amount of things over the past 2 weeks since I moved to this city. I‚Äôm a very quiet and shy person and my emotions/anxiety seem to take over sometimes so I barely talk or get flirty. She‚Äôs usually the one keeping the convo going and I actively listen and follow through based off surroundings and what she‚Äôs saying. Never seen a girl more beautiful so I get tongue tied and lost for words sometimes too.
- 
- she seems to say yes to everything I ask even though she has plans, she tries to coordinate so that she can hang with me too.

My only issue is that there might be another guy she‚Äôs seeing, but I don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôre together. I‚Äôm too afraid to ask. He‚Äôs good looking while I think I‚Äôm average so I feel intimidated. He has a car, I don‚Äôt because I just moved to a new city. He can take her places, etc. 

I asked her to come meet me today because I had a surprise for her. She had plans, but squeezed me in. She even tried to change the timing of her other plan so she can come to mine. She told me a while ago that she wanted to be in a certain professors class in uni. That certain Professor invited me somewhere for a college-run event and I‚Äôm taking her to meet her so she can network, etc. after that, we‚Äôre heading to a rave. 

TLDR: Sorry if this was long. I‚Äôm just basically saying she‚Äôs showing signs of interest in me, and I‚Äôm intimated by this guy she may or may not be seeing. I never ask her if she‚Äôs seeing someone, because I feel weird about it. I like to make subtle moves and play the long game so I can get to know a person. I don‚Äôt like mind games, manipulation, and touchy flirtation because I respect her boundaries. I also don‚Äôt want to intrude on her private life. 

I don‚Äôt believe in friend zone because I believe you have to be a friend to a girl first before you start dating. You just have to make the right moves and not take too long, otherwise you‚Äôll lose your chance. 

Having said that, what do you think my next move should be? 

Grateful for your time and help.
Please go easy on me. I‚Äôm not afraid to say I‚Äôm a bit fragile/vulnerable and stressed at the moment. I‚Äôm overthinking this and need advice on how and what to do rather than what position I‚Äôm in right now with her.","I‚Äôd say just ask her straight up, you can ask her in a way that doesn‚Äôt reveal your interest though if that‚Äôs why you are nervous about asking."

After this me and my ex had been meeting up and I really thought it was going somewhere. But it didnt and she recently told me she was in a new relationship after not speaking to me for about 3 months.   
I have been on dating apps and they are just not working for me. Unfortunately they are the only way I get laid. I am defintely not an ugly guy, I work out and take care of myself.   
But I lack a lot of self confidence and I find it incredibly difficult to approach women I find attractive. I do not lack the social skills and I am actually very good at talking to women.

dating,145f8mo,1686341014.0,I feel so lonely even though I usually enjoy being alone,"I am a 22F in my third year on Uni (molecual biology major), soon approaching my 4th year. I live in a dorm with my high school friend who I've known for 11 years now. She is asexual I am bisexual. I dare to say she is more anxious person than me because I have been trying really hard to work on my anxiety while she just tries to avoid it as much as possible. I love her I try to help her as much as I can but I can't say she is able to do the same for me which is something I accept given her issues. What I really liked was that I could talk to her about everything but I can't tell her about this.

A year ago she was approached by a boy during a field trip and they started dating. She's been with him for a year now and they meet up like once a week. I don't mind her talking to me about him because she is my friend and I always try to be here for her. But whenever she talks about him my heart hurts. We have two more friends from High school, one got boyfriend since her 1st year on Uni and the other one now went on a few dates with a boy her mom matched her with a few weeks ago. All of them talking about these experiences together is something that just hurts me so much and I can't talk to anybody about this pain. My grand-aunt and my mother keep telling me to find someone too and the more I hear anyone talking to be about relationships I hurt so much. I mean I can feel my heart and my soul physically hurting and I just want to hide somewhere and cry. 

I am from a family where I had to learn to count on myself very early on. I was emotionally and mentally abused for years. Being alone was something I got used to very quickly and most of the times I prefer to be alone because I can do things I like without anyone judging me or telling me that I like stupid things.

But lately being alone always makes me fall into these feelings of loneliness. It makes me feel like I am missing out on my young years. I was dating a girl during my 2nd year on Uni and I broke up with her after a month because she is asexual and I just need more physical closeness than she would be comfortable with. I tried tinder but I have a few very important things I need in a person and I can't seem to find that person. One more problem is that I am a virgin and when I finally feel like I could click with someone they just want to rush into sex and I can't really provide that yet. I mean I am open to try things and get closer but I need time to actually get comfortable with that person so sex after only meeting 2 times is really not for me. Tbh because of many guys I met on tinder I am starting to feel ashamed of being a virgin but I just want to meet someone who is more special for me not just a one-night-stand.

I just got a part-time job in a lab for this summer and if my training goes well they want to keep me there during the semester as well. It was hard to approach the lab and go for an interview because my anxiety just always acts up but I made it and I am really happy I did. I have to start working on my bachleor's thesis that I have been putting off for a long time now because I'm really worried to start as I hate making mistakes but I know I have to start and I really want to work on myself. I am very self-aware person but these feelings about loneliness are something I just have hard times understanding because as I said I usually don't mind being on my own but lately it has really been painful.",
dating,145f2q7,1686340616.0,"lies, trust, and long-distance","My boyfriend of two years spends a lot of time working in another state (3 weeks a month or so). He keeps saying that he will catch up financially and do that less (it's a business with his brother). The distance has created a lot of tension in our relationship partially because I moved where I currently live for him and don't really want a long distance relationship. 

About 6 months ago we had a major break down in communication because I wasn't comfortable with a male friend of his moving in. We only have one bathroom and he is gone so much. At that time he told many little lies because I think he didn't want anyone to be unhappy. But it left me looking like a really bad person and feeling unheard. Many of the lies at that time were also about silly things. One day he was gone all day and told me he was at the bowling alley which was closed and also a park that is closed for the winter. 

Since winter he has become more worried about money and gone more. I think we have been around each other about 3 weeks in 4 months. On my birthday, I found out that he started pursuing a woman in the state that he works. I saw a message because he often lets me use his phone for things. He had made plans to cook her dinner when he got back and also seemed to be giving love eyes emojis to all of her social media posts. I asked him about it and he said she was a friend and making a website for their business. I asked her and she seemed to be surprised because he had told her that he recently broke up with a girlfriend and that the intent had been clear to her that they were pursuing a romantic relationship. 

I feel extremely hurt of course and have been through this before. But he also told me he wants to work it out. 

It is extremely complicated because I had thought this was a pretty serious relationship and I live in his house. It is an old house and I am more handy than my bf so have done significant renovations and even spent a lot of my own money. I also pay him rent. Since I didn't want to be in this state in the first place, I would move to another state if it is really over. 

Sorry for such a long winded explanation on the way to a question. He wants to work it out and he also wants me to continue to upkeep the house and run Airbnb. I agreed because we have an arrangement that would allow me to recoup funds for some of my investment in the house. We decided it was most healthy to put the relationship on a break so we can both figure out what we want (the break was my idea because with the lack of trust, I can't imagine phone communication that doesn't go negative). But given that my trust is so broken and he is gone so much of the time, is there any hope to repair this? 

I think figuring out some answer to this question is important to me because given that he owns the house, it would probably make sense for me to keep my word on the arrangement (airbnb, etc) but begin to move my things to a storage unit so that my exit is easier when it is ultimately necessary. Otherwise, I could hold tight, upkeep the house/business and wait and see. But this is all pretty anxious for me because when there have been big fights he threatens to put my stuff on the curb and/or lock me out and I wouldn't have much recourse since the house is indeed his and we don't have a formal landlord/tenant agreement or signed document.",

dating,145etlb,1686339976.0,To what extent should you change for love ?,"Hi everyone, I (20M) have been dating a girl (20) for 15 months now and she recently revealed to me things that I find hard to accept... I don¬¥t really know if I need advice or support but I felt the urge to write it. 

I apologize in advance for my english, I¬¥m not a native speaker.

To give you a bit of context, most of our relationship is good. My feelings for her are very strong. 

Since we got together, she's been making regular ""suggestions"" or demands, for example she used to regularly point out the fact that she would like me to come to the gym with her, that my body was good but she¬¥d prefer me¬†more¬†muscled. When she undestood that these demands made me feel quite insecure, she stopped asking. However, now that I know what she desires I can't really take it out of my head and I still feel insecure about my body with her. She's also been asking me to change how I dress, or to cut my hair more regularly, saying these things would help her be more attracted to me. These remarks really started to make me wonder why she would be dating me if she doesn't like the way I dress or my body‚Ä¶ Of course, I now feel kind of insecure about the way I look. 

Also, we very rarely make love (once a month or even less). To be honest, I would have liked us to do it more but I¬¥ve never really talked about it to her because I feel like telling this to her might ""force"" her to do things with me more than she would like to, and I would never do that to her. Basically, I thought she just didn¬¥t like sex very much and I could live with it since I love her and thought that sex was not as important as the rest of our relationship. 

Yesterday we¬¥ve had a big deep talk about our relationship and I felt like it was a good time to talk about it, not really to put pressure on her but I wanted to know if my assumption was true... She answered to me that she really has the best times of her life with me but she doesn't really desire me in a sexual way (or rarely). Later in the discussion, she told me that she used to make love very often (~1 a day) with one of her previous boyfriends and this really hurt me (even though I'm usualy not easilly hurt). These two informations combined really made me feel like a piece of sh*t. I felt like I was not satisfying her enough, otherwise we would do it more often. Also, I I can't help to compare me to her previous boyfriend, even though she tells me sex with me is better than with him (I find it difficult to believe her about that)...

When I asked her why she doesn't desire me as much as she used to desire him, she answered that they has a long distance relationship so the desire was strong when they saw each other, and then she brang back again the remarks about my way to dress and my body, telling me she would have dreamed about dating a gym boy but still likes the way I look. This answer felt so bad I wanted to throw up and later I couldn't really sleep, this really made me question why she would be with me if she doesn't find me attractive. She also said again that changing these things might help turning her on but for now I feel so bad about these revelations I'm kind of paralysed, I'm desperate she doens't like me the way I am and don¬¥t really know if trying to make these changes would be the good thing to do :(","she doesn't sound like a very good person. if she wants someone/something else, she should go find it. trying to change other people to suit your needs, especially physically, is a terrible idea.

I originally bought it to overcome porn-induced ED and death grip, as it was seriously affecting my sex life.

I pretty much bought it to re-train my body to actually be aroused by physical sexual activity, and not just stuff on a screen. Tldr, it worked amazingly well.

However, I'm now ready to start dating again, and I'm kinda worried about what any potential partners will think when they inevitably find out at some point.

dating,145e7e6,1686338487.0,How I almost met my mother in law,"This is how my relationship with my future wife developed and what I‚Äôd call our real first date.

&#x200B;

I met her around Christmas of junior year when I went out with her roommate. They didn‚Äôt get along well so if I was going over she was never there. I still remember the first time I saw her though. I was hanging around her floor and she was walking by to go to the bathroom before bed to brush her teeth. She had on a red union suit with a trap door and the guy I was with yelled ‚ÄúDoes the trap door work‚Äù. She pulled it down for ¬Ω a second and it was so innocent yet sexy I was hooked.

&#x200B;

I thought she was attractive and talented but she was supposedly ‚ÄúPre engaged‚Äù to her high school boyfriend who was at Cornell.  Also academically she was a mess. She didn‚Äôt get along with her mother and chose RIT because it was the furthest college away from her parents with an art program. Her major was Environmental Design which she chose because she hated it the least. By the middle of junior year she was already almost a year behind in her major mostly because she didn‚Äôt go to class. But what was obvious was she was an incredibly talented artist. She drew almost constantly. Every night a bunch of our friends  would meet at the dining hall and she always had her Rapidograph with her and she would draw on the trays and take requests and people might not know her but everybody recognized her trays and they were a big hit.

&#x200B;

So we hung around more and more and by the end of junior year we were really close to being a couple but when school ended I was going to stay at school to be a teaching assistant and she was going home which she wasn‚Äôt looking forward to. That summer I was a TA I was in charge of opening the darkrooms and then I sat in this windowless room with this guy Bruce and students would bring their prints out for advice. Mostly Bruce and I just talked. We weren‚Äôt friends at the beginning but if you‚Äôre stuck in a small room with someone you have to find something to talk about and we became friends. 

&#x200B;

That summer I had a Volvo 144 which was a fun car but  it needed new brakes and carbuerators and stupidly I thought I could do the work myself. The car sat on blocks almost the whole summer, undriveable. Most days when I was bored watching the darkrooms I‚Äôd write her a letter, make her a collage or do anything I could do to impress her. I wasn‚Äôt trying to but I‚Äôm sure her mother saw everything I sent and now realized I was a threat to her plans for Bethany. I don‚Äôt remember how but we made arrangements to get together and go to NYC for the night. My best friend at the time Dave was working at a newspaper in Northern New Jersey so the plan was that I‚Äôd hitchhike to New Jersey, he‚Äôd pick me up and we‚Äôd go and pick up a girl he was interested in who wasn‚Äôt too far from Bethany‚Äôs house.

&#x200B;

So I started hitchhiking early one Saturday and I only remember one ride on the way down and one on the way back. On the way down I had every male hitchhiker‚Äôs fantasy, An attractive horny girl picked me up. I didn‚Äôt hitchhike a lot but I think I only got picked up by women once or twice. She was driving a convertible and wearing about the shortest cut off shorts you could imagine. She kept telling me how attractive I was and I‚Äôm no angel but I was already behind schedule so I just kept telling her I was going to see my girlfriend. Eventually she gave up and told me my girlfriend was really lucky and she started flashing any truckers that went by. She dropped me off and I never got picked up by a horny woman again.

&#x200B;

I got to New Jersey late, Dave picked me up and we headed towards Westchester where Bethany and the other girl lived. When we got to Bethany‚Äôs house I was all set to meet her parents but as soon as she heard our car she came running out. It was dusk so I think it was 9 o‚Äôclock by then. Halfway to the city I said that I was surprised her parents were letting her go to the city. She said she had just told them we were going to a local bar. That wasn‚Äôt encouraging but I was so glad to see her I didn‚Äôt say anything.. We got a parking space right in the middle of Greenwich Village and we decided we‚Äôd meet back at the car at 1. Then it was a really sweet date, we walked around Greenwich Village, Little Italy is right next to the Village and there was a feast to a Saint and they had rides set up and I remember we went on the Ferris wheel.We held hands but we never even kissed. At 1 we met Dave and his date back at the car and headed back to Westchester.

&#x200B;

 It was during one of the late 70‚Äôs gas crises, OPEC had cut back production and there were lines at every gas station. Every station we tried to stop at had a line of at least 50 cars even though it was 1:30 in the morning. The further we got away from NYC the more remote it got and we didn‚Äôt see any gas stations so when we pulled into her driveway it was 4am. Dave‚Äôs car was running on fumes and Bethany said her Dad would have gas for his lawnmower. As soon as she started to open the garage door all the lights went on in the house and her mother started screaming, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe it, I can‚Äôt believe it‚Äù. The 3 of us looked at each other and decided leaving as fast as we could was the best choice so Dave and I took off and left Bethany to deal with her mother. We finally ran out of gas 50 yards from a gas station and pushed the car to the pumps and fell asleep. When the station opened they woke us up and gave us gas. Dave had to work for the newspaper so he dropped me off at the Thruway and I started to hitchhike back to Rochester.

&#x200B;

I only remember 1 ride on the way back. A guy picked me up and the sun was warm and I was asleep in 5 minutes. I don‚Äôt know how long I slept but I woke up and something seemed different. There were all these porno magazines spread out and if you‚Äôre not expecting porn it takes a while to understand what you‚Äôre looking at. So I‚Äôm looking at these pictures and saying ‚ÄúWell that‚Äôs a penis and there‚Äôs another one‚Äù. I kept looking for girls but I realized  it was gay porn so I sat up straight. The guy was cool and invited me to his house but I said I had to get back to Rochester. If you were a young guy hitchhiking you always got picked up by gay guys but I never had any problems. It‚Äôs hard to imagine now but in 1979 you had to work to find porn, now you have to work to avoid it. The standard pickup line by these guys was ‚ÄúSo what do you think of those porno films‚Äù. They were just pathetic and lame.

&#x200B;

So somehow I made it to Rochester and the Thruway entrance is about 7 miles from RIT. I had barely started walking and a good friend drove by, looked at me,  and didn‚Äôt stop. I saw him the next day and he said ‚ÄúI thought that was you‚Äù. So I walked the 7 miles to campus and I was exhausted but excited because I finally felt like I had a girlfriend.We finally became a couple in October and soon after things with  her parents got even worse if you can imagine.",

We most likely wont meet for the next three months because Im abroad. Moreover, we also most likely wont be meeting very often even when Im gonna be back, because I will start studying in a completly different town, that is pretty far away.

Personally I think that its completly possible, but I wanted to hear whether other people have similiar stories and how they ended.",Yes it definitely can work when both people are mature and determined to be with one another.

dating,145dzbu,1686337947.0,Thoughts on my friend's situationship?,"So this is not my problem, but my friend has recently been ranting to me about this situationship she's having and it's kind of annoying me that she's not taking any of my advice and I wanted to see other people's opinions on it out of curiosity.

So basically she's 23 and she's seeing a girl who is 20. They have been seeing each other since December and started having sexual relations in March. 23 year old wants to date her but doesn't want to ask her. 20 year old is not doing anything I guess, but has voiced concerns over the 23 year old not asking her out. I basically told my friend that she should ask because they are at a point where they are having sex and going on dates but not having a label? And clearly both people are getting hurt at the lack of commitment.

I love her but it's also kind of lame that she is seeing this girl without asking her out, like it kind of feels like she's just using her but is scared to commit. She's not going to listen to me but I wanted to hear everyone's thoughts on situationships because it honestly bothers me lol and it's been a point of debate among my friends recently. But yeah this is all just out of good fun and curiosity, obviously at the end of the day my friend is just going to do her thing lol

He's best friends with his ex girlfriend. They talk almost every day or just send memes back & forth on IG, they regularly go out to dinner each week and because he bought a puppy during the relationship and she helped raise it, she still has keys to his place and is over frequently. She'll even take him home to her house during his longer work shifts. He told me they were friends with benefits for 2 years and then had a tumultuous on again/off again relationship for 2 years after that. The last 6 months they've been broken up, haven't had sex but they have kept up appearances, i.e his family doesn't know they broke up, neither do his friends except maybe his twin brother. He said he loves her but didn't want to be in a relationship with her but also can't stand losing her. He also said she's the most important friend of his. Apparently they had issues because he couldn't accept the boundaries she placed on him constantly staying in contact with past hook ups via social media and it made her ""nagging and annoying"". He checks in with me regularly asking how my day is going and stuff but doesn't do that with her.  She tried leaving him and cutting contact but he kept pushing to stay in her life and now they're doing this.   
I'd love to head some thoughts on this because he doesn't see anything wrong with what he's doing or the way their relationship is but I disagree.  
TLDR; This guy hangs out with his ex every week, she still has keys to his house to help with his dog, either talks to or sends memes back and forth every day.

dating,145cv0i,1686335283.0,What are my next steps with this girl?,"Hi everyone,

I have been talking to this girl for around 2.5 months. We met off of Hinge and it seems like we have really hit it off.

We have been texting nearly every day. When I don‚Äôt text first I find that she is texting me asking how my day is going. The texts normally are just asking how each other is doing or getting to know each other.

Since we have started talking we have gone out 2 times and have plans on a third. We already have had conversations about previous relationships and what we are looking for in partners. We haven‚Äôt kissed or done anything else other than hug (because I didn‚Äôt want to come off as too aggressive).

It seems like we have common goals and I think I like her.

I was just wondering where do I go from here? I don‚Äôt have too much experience dating so I don‚Äôt really know what‚Äôs next.

Thanks in advance!","Well, sounds like the logical next step is a kiss"

dating,145ciho,1686334432.0,Am I a bad person?,"Disclosure: no ages or names will be shared. I (F) met this guy about year ago. I developed a crush on him as one does when they get close to one another. There was only one problem. A really close friend of mine also had a crush on the same guy. She knew about my feelings for him, but the next thing I know, they started dating. There was definitely a sense of betrayal that went away quickly in fear of losing both of my friends and so, I tried to smother my feelings. Make them disappear. When people tell you that feelings don't just go away, they aren't wrong. And so I had to distance myself. Me and my crush lost our close relationship out of respect for my friend. Now this relationship recently ended due to personal reasons after a year and a half long relationship. They are both in the same friend group, so it feels a little awkward. Everyone in the friend group is comforting my friend (F) but nobody really thinks to comfort the guy. And so, me thinking my feelings had finally subsided, I chose to be the one he could confide in. We've gotten super close recently, texting, late night calls, having conversations we both enjoy, and my feelings have decided to make a comeback. I'm not sure how he feels about me and so I asked my older sister. She told me that no man would stay up late to talk to me, especially when he had to wake up early the next morning for work unless he liked me. So now my hopes are high but I feel like a horrible person for liking my friend's ex and wanting to pursue a relationship with him. Am I a bad person? What should I do in this situation?",You‚Äôre not horrible. Date whoever makes you happy. And if she‚Äôs really your friend she just wants to see you happy

dating,145cdv4,1686334131.0,Don't know what I'm doing wrong,"I (30M) am recently trying dating online and IRL. And to be honest it has been somewhat frustrating for multiple reasons.

I am 6 ft tall, I am somewhat handsome, I have a good paying job. I have a car and knowledge of all the good places in my city. I also know how to use the bus. I am about to buy a house. I would like to get married and have kids. I am ambivert. Mostly related to the geek side of things. I have ease of speech and have spoken several times in events and reunions so I am pretty confident. I dress as cleanly as possible and my personal hygiene is good.

I got impeccable reputation from work and other places, people keep constantly saying I'm a good man in most places.

I'm looking for something serious. As in a relationship that can end in marriage. (With several years of travel and fun things before of course, I clarify that I am not a completely trad guy but I stick to that role as much as I can, I am flexibl).

Here's my experience in those two settings:

1: OLD

Basically I am that wierd guy that ACTUALLY gets matches from girls (tinder, bumble) (more than 10 per month or so) but those matches basically mean nothing. Generally I get a good conversation out of most girls but when I ask them out to actually talk they start ghosting me. It's just a plain waste of time most cases.

The only times I've actually went out with two out of all my matches the girls were really boring.... They didn't wanna share a lot of details about them and were basically the stereotype of girl who only wanted a free meal. Super bad.


2: Physical places

I attend mostly cosplay events geek stuff of all kinds. Almost every girl I hang around has a boyfriend (objectively speaking because I am NOT looking for someone who's indecisive of it's partner and doesn't want to end the relationship before getting into another) so they are strictly in all sense of the word FRIENDS or ACQUAINTANCES (multiple cases). Getting that out of the way there were a few girls that are single that I've invited to hang out and chat...

Another place I've tried to look for is in the (most recent) workplace, and here LITERALLY all girls have a boyfriend with relationships that have lasted up to 6 years, some 3 years some around that number (which I don't particularly would like... If I'm lasting that long I'd be commiting btw).

And I do shooting sports in my country which is really hard compared to doing in it in a country like the USA but usually old men hang in there. No girls at all.

I also go to the gym but I have the same problem as in the workplace. Everyone is taken. Actually the 100% of girls.

My two most recent cases were: 

1.- I talked a lot with this girl at the cosplay events and at a friend's house. She said that she would love to hang out and find out more about me. So I invited her over (for 3 weeks, messaged her once a week telling her if she wanted to hang out to different places) and she always had an excuse. 

(Those being: I have a cold, I am attending to a church event, my aunt's birthday) 

I didn't quite believed it but I gave her the benefit of the doubt. After those 3 times I stopped asking her and told her to call me when she had time.

2.- Another girl I met at my previous workplace. We've been messaging quite a while but she seems too, to always puts up an excuse similarity to the other girl (again, my policy is that usually I stop asking after 3 times tops) This girl has put up an excuse two times already saying ""I'll come if I end up this other business first"" that business being another thing she had with her friends.

The thing is that they seem to have interest but when they're home they lose it (what I'm perceiving is mostly lazyness and a lack of interest).

Is there anyway I can change this streak of luck? I really hate talking to a girl, saying I want to get to know her more (literally opening my feelings which feels shameful and makes me feel vulnerable every time) and then getting excuses for the reasons they can't or being downright ghosted.

dating,145aae4,1686329186.0,Friend Zoning,"This is insight and guiding support from a dad who has been an addict, is ADHD and somewhere ""on the spectrum"", who has found and lost ""love"" and discovered that I have to love myself first before I can love, and truly appreciate, anybody else.
This reflection is about needing to allow ourselves to appreciate every emotion b/c every emotion WILL help us be the best is imaginable. 
Just imagine if all the people could express their appreciation of emoting...

About kindred spirits, 
You two have so much in common that your positive and negative traits are ""apples to apples"". ""Friend-zoning"" Is for emotional security, which is a quality you want for ""oneness"".
You both may be aware at some level of consciousness that you will both bring out the best, and worst, of each other, in addition to needing to keep some emotional distance between you in order to maintain a lasting, in-person, connection. 
To its benefit, this long standing friendship will keep you in each other's proximity and allow each of you to work through any self-loathing attributes/addictions and be there for one another. 
Unfortunately, you have to exercise patience for the long-term reward of ""oneness"" (at least that is the story of you two I've made up in my head). This may also mean you and he take other partners over the years. Depending on how you look at it you two will always be there to pick the other up after being crushed by ""love"", which is really each of you not getting what you really need from those relationships, namely, the other. 
Love is found in patience which is found in having patience in oneself. Learn to love you and if he can do the same you will find bliss in each other's arms. 

If time was fair we could gaze upon our lives from birth to death and experience the minutia of every emotion to KNOW what the right choices are and to experience as much good for as long as possible. But we are but an imperfect reflection of God (or whatever) and have to feel every feeling in real-time.

He asked to see me again, for a date. I was excited and happily agreed. I noticed he hadn‚Äôt logged into grindr in 17 hours, and I wasn‚Äôt really chatting with anyone so I deleted mine. It obviously jumped the gun but I didn‚Äôt want this guy to think I was looking around after what was a really rare special night (at least for me) 

The week between that night and our second date, we were texting every day T least once a day, and he initiated a lot of the conversation. He said that he‚Äôs excited to see me etc and I said as much too. 

Our second date seemed to go very well. We spent all day together and after the date he thanked me for another amazing day. He told me he‚Äôd be very busy the next week, work wise. 

So basically this past week I haven‚Äôt really been hearing a lot from him. I have initiated a few times and he does reply. The other night I just called him and he answered and we chatted a bit, he seemed happy to talk but said that this weekend he wants to just relax but we should plan something again for the following weekend. 

I know this sounds entirely normal, but since our last date, I have been sort of uneasy and anxious. I kind of feel like there‚Äôs a bit of a difference in the energy he is giving me. 

I must point out that I have dated many guys and I haven‚Äôt felt this kind of intensity before, maybe because we had great sex right away and then connected emotionally a bit‚Ä¶i am unexpectedly smitten.

dating,1458j0j,1686325103.0,I (27m) had an awkward hookup with a girl (28f). Wondering how I could have been handled better.,"

This girl and I had been on 4 dates and everything was going well. We really enjoyed each others company and she told me she felt happy and relaxed around me, and I felt the same about her. 

At the end of our 4th date we start to hookup for the first time (we had only had brief kisses the previous two dates). A few minutes into the kissing she starts to critique my kissing. She does it by asking ‚Äúdo you know how to French kiss?‚Äù. Now I‚Äôm not saying I‚Äôm the world‚Äôs best or most experienced kisser but my kissing style hadn‚Äôt been an issue with past partners. 

I‚Äôm of course open to constructive criticism and learning what my partner prefers, but I felt like the way she delivered the line was a bit insensitive and it threw me off my game and I got in my head. I did ask her how she preferred it and she responded a little frustrated and said ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt teach you how to do it‚Äù. She eventually gave me the advice to ‚Äúnot move your lips and just move your tongue‚Äù. I had never really done it that way before but I tried it that way and apparently that wasn‚Äôt what she was looking for either. I tried to diffuse the situation by saying we would work on it and figure out what worked for us. She responded saying ‚Äúno, you‚Äôll work on it‚Äù. She tried to say it softly but the comment didn‚Äôt make me feel great because I felt like I was genuinely trying to understand how she preferred it and I felt like I just got back a lot of blame and frustration from her when a more gentler approach would have been better.  

We eventually decided not to use much tongue when we kissed and she said she enjoyed that better. But later when she was touching me through my underwear I wasn‚Äôt getting aroused because I was still rattled by the earlier exchange. I told her that I was still in my head over the kissing critique and we decided to stop. I went home and the next day she texted me saying she felt connected to me emotionally but didn‚Äôt think we were compatible physically. She was nice enough in the breakup text but I am still really bothered by her tone and her general attitude during the criticism.  I took all the blame for the situation in my response and told her I had some anxieties I was trying to work through. 

I didn‚Äôt tell her how the delivery of the critique bothered me but I wish I would have so that we could have talked it through. She was always very sweet to me before this so it was very surprising that her tone wasn‚Äôt gentler. I know it wasn‚Äôt her intent to hurt my feelings but I do wish I had let her know how it made me feel.  I initially wanted to ask for a second chance to see if we could establish the physical connection but now I‚Äôm wondering if her handling of the situation was a red flag or if I am just being too sensitive.

Was there a better way for her to handle giving me the critique? Was there anything I should have done differently? 

It‚Äôs been about a month since we last spoke but the interaction still bothers me and is making me feel like I should have stood up for myself and been open about the fact that I was uncomfortable.","Homie, you didn‚Äôt do anything wrong. She didn‚Äôt like the way you kissed, and she became sarcastic and snarky about it. Unless you were biting her painfully or slobbering over her face in a gross way, it probably is not that serious and probably did not warrant being rude. It‚Äôs not your fault that you got in your head about that. After all, you like her and want her to feel good. You even tried to ask her how she likes it and got sarcastic response to *that*. 

*In my experience, someone who gets an attitude when you‚Äôre actively and genuinely trying to find ways to please them probably has their own personal issues they need to work through, and is most definitely a walking red flag*.

I've noticed that many women tend to prefer dating men who are years older than them. As an 18-year-old guy, I've encountered situations where women literally my age lose interest once they learn my age. I either get ghosted, straight up told that they think I‚Äôm probably not mature enough, get asked to be FWBs which I‚Äôm not into. How can I show my maturity before they assume I‚Äôm childish and not responsible to be in a relationship? Any input is appreciated","There are plenty of girls who don't care. You're young and new to dating apps, the responses you're getting are very normal. Eventually you'll learn to roll with the punches.

For every 100 girls you wipe on, 1 will swipe on you. For every 10 that swipe on you, 1 will go out with you. For every 5 that go out with you, 1 will go out with you again, etc.

dating,1457h3d,1686322637.0,Asking to Split Check 2 Days After Date,"I (F 45) have been dating a M (31) for about 4 months. Our economic situations are fairly similar in that we're both on rather strict budgets. For the most part, when we go out we split things based on the costs of our meals (his insistence). I don't have too much of an issue with this, but it would be nice for one of us to treat the other every now and then (I've treated him by paying for dinner once).  
At any rate we went to a restaurant where it was an order in one part and seat yourself kinda deal. I grabbed the table and told him what I wanted. He ordered and brought the food to our table. I asked him how much I owed him; however, apparently he didn't hear me. We had a nice dinner, shared food and he even sipped some of my alcoholic beverage I grabbed from the bar (he did not want one). Here's the rub: he's not a big texter. He rarely initiates texts, but promptly and enthusiastically responds. Two days after the date I wake up to a text from him asking if I could Zelle my portion of dinner. Nothing more. To say I was disappointed is an understatement.  I Zelled him and explained I did ask him what I owed and when he didn't answer I thought he was treating me.  
I'm seeing him this weekend and could use some advice on how to tactfully address this. It isn't about the money, it's the manner in which it was done. TIA!","This was a simple misunderstanding. I‚Äôd put it aside and continue on as before. I get why you were deflated but if you like him I‚Äôd forget about it. 

You could say in person ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt mind that you wrote about the check but I guess I got excited at first that you were writing to say hello.‚Äù

dating,1456xm8,1686321333.0,House maintenance when living with boyfriend,"I had a breakdown today because I got triggered when my boyfriend puts my newly washed clothes on top of my sister‚Äôs really really smelly clothes. The resentment has been piling up for a while now. 

A little bit of my background: I am about to start college in September. Right now I have a lot of things on my plate. Me and my boyfriend are almost 9 months into dating and we live back-and-forth in each others‚Äô house. 

However, I‚Äôm starting to notice that he doesn‚Äôt care about house maintenance and organizing as much as I do. 

Not only him, when I‚Äôm staying at my own house, my younger sister is the worst. She would pile up unclean laundry in the bathroom to the point it collapses and fills the floor; she would also never washes the dishes no matter how many days they‚Äôre left in the sink and wait until I do it for her. She claims herself to be a perfectionist and gets mad whenever I said I don‚Äôt think she is one. I don‚Äôt know maybe it‚Äôs some 16-year-old‚Äôs common issues during puberty. So when I am in my own house I‚Äôm always cleaning already, I would also use my own part-time salary to buy different items for the house to look tidier. Yet my stepmom (I‚Äôd rather call her my dad‚Äôs wife) would still complain that I am messy and a germ to this family. It kinda explains why I‚Äôve been building that resentment in me. 

One day I heard my boyfriend arguing with his mom about clearing the clutter in the house. Apparently he doesn‚Äôt care about house maintenance as much / prioritise it at the moment, I do always notice that he doesn‚Äôt mind if the room is messy or if anywhere is not tidy in the house, he can just live with it. This fact bothers me. 

Maybe it is because I have always been taking care of my sister‚Äôs mess while still being complained as a messy person. I tried my best to maintain the house already and even prioritise it over all my studies and sleeping schedule, and people still can‚Äôt see it. 

I want things to work out between me and my boyfriend. I‚Äôm scared I can‚Äôt handle it if it‚Äôs going to be like this in the future. Today‚Äôs breakdown really make me realize how heavy this has been on me and I feel like people around me doesn‚Äôt understand how messy the house is and how hard I‚Äôve been trying to maintain it. 

I tried meditation, I tried effective communication (with my boyfriend, cannot with my sister cause she thinks the whole world is against her), I tried gratefulness, I tried breaking down tasks and divide workload (he always leaves mess or things undone behind). Please tell me what I can do anymore, before I have another breakdown again.","let me first tell you that you're handling it extremely well, and this stress is perfectly normal. dude needs to get his shit together, you're not his mom.

as somebody that has dealt with not one but THREE long term girlfriends that do this exact thing, you have three options:

1. **ask him to go to couples therapy with you (non-atomic).** it will really raise the stakes and show that you're serious. moreover, these problems aren't relationship-specific. he's not inherently wrong for being messy, but it's a very big compatibility between you two. a therapist will present options to try and fix the issue, and he will realize that things are getting serious and he'll need to change his ways to make it all work.
2. **accept that this is how the relationship is going to be (non-atomic).** some people are just messy slobs. if you're not, you need to seriously look at the rest of your life and if you can handle living with this dude. sometimes it's worth it for some people. relationships are all about compromises. only you can decide if it's worth it.
3. **give him an ultimatum (semi-atomic).** definitely not my favourite option as i generally don't believe in ultimatums, but you need to let him know that you're serious. tell him he needs to clean up after himself and all that, or you're leaving. understand that you need to stick to your guns with this, which may be painful.
4. **leave (atomic).** i've found that people like this only change ever temporarily. they'll see that you're serious, change for a week or so, then go back to their old ways. only you can decide if it's worth turfing the relationship over."
dating,1456wjj,1686321261.0,My boyfriend is very hot and cold,"My (22F) boyfriend (26M) has been really hot and cold lately. We‚Äôve been together for a year, and at the beginning of our relationship he used to be so affectionate and we would both buy each other little gifts, tell each other about the little funny things going on about our day. 

The past couple months, sometimes when he comes over (or I go over his), he‚Äôs immediately so cold. He doesn‚Äôt smile, doesn‚Äôt seem happy to see me. I feel like I‚Äôm always the one that‚Äôs listening to him, and when I try to speak about something he‚Äôs not interested and doesn‚Äôt really listen. I still make him small gifts and send him those small occasional updates to let him know I‚Äôm thinking of him, but it doesn‚Äôt seem like he care. He doesn‚Äôt share as much anymore. 

I‚Äôm not sure if he was just doing that to get me to be his girlfriend/fall in love with him, or if he‚Äôs falling out of love with me. Some days he is SO affectionate and will gush over me, but most days now he just feels cold and distant. I never know what to expect when we hangout.",leave. it‚Äôll only get worse.
dating,1456swl,1686321019.0,Thoughts about having someone over,"Ok, bear with me here please bc I (42f) have a weird hangup. I have a hard time with having a man in my house (like even platonic). Its a psychic energy issue non trauma related, I'm just sensitive to other people's energy. I will only have a partner over once we have been in an established and committed relationship for around 2 or 3 months. I'll sleep with someone fairly early on or just hookup at their place, but for me, having a man in my home is like introducing them to my parents. Like, that's real intimacy for me. 

I'm curious and I'd like to get an idea from everyone about how they would feel about this/if anyone else does this. I'm not really necessarily for psychoanalysis, but more of your thoughts and would you view this as a red flag and why. 

Tldr: I don't have men over unless in an established relationship","I don‚Äôt think this is weird and I would say I‚Äôm similar. I like to keep my space, well, MY space. I don‚Äôt like to invite people over unless I‚Äôm very close to them.

I‚Äôve gotten to know him a little better and he is honestly so funny, attractive, and intelligent. he is single with occasional girlfriends but nothing serious.

he has a good career going as well.

I‚Äôve been thinking about it a lot and I am genuinely interested but I have no idea how to make a move without making things awkward‚Ä¶ we text occasionally, and he is always happy to talk to me but I don‚Äôt want to overstep any boundaries, and I can‚Äôt tell if he‚Äôs just being friendly or if he would potentially date me.

dating,14567ky,1686319576.0,New relationship drama,"I (m27) have been dating a woman (f23) for about a month now. We met on a rather romantic date and she and I felt such a connection that we slept together on the second date. The sex was amazing and we both had fun. Beyond that she has a ton of what I would consider green flags. She‚Äôs a bit immature, but I have a lot to work on too and I always looked forward to seeing her.

Initially things have been amazing except she kept prying into my past. I deliberately don‚Äôt bring it up because I know it will only play on my and her insecurities and lead to strife. I only care about the future.  One day, we‚Äôre together and she asks if I‚Äôm dating a lot and how she knows that she‚Äôll be special. I explain that I have dated a few times, but generally don‚Äôt go further than getting to know someone because I need to feel a connection with someone in order to sleep with them. I then proceeded to ask what her dating experience was like. She said that she‚Äôd only been on two dates in the past me being the second. This floored me as some of what we did together during sex did not indicate someone who was inexperienced, so I inquired and asked that she explain because I was confused and she said that in college she didn‚Äôt have time to date so she would just meet random people on tinder and have them come over for hook ups, then send them on their way. Due to how conservative this woman is I didn‚Äôt expect it and was a bit taken aback. So I did the insecure thing and asked her how many she had slept with. She said she didn‚Äôt know and so I asked if it was more than 3, 10, and after I asked about 20-30 she said she didn‚Äôt keep a list. I have slept with 6 people in my past as well, but those had been committed partners.

I view sex as something that should only be done between people who have a strong connection, so the idea of opening one‚Äôs body up to complete strangers on a whim is crazy to me. 

I will admit I reacted badly to this and handled it poorly. I feel like I view her differently now despite KNOWING that sexual history shouldn‚Äôt matter. The way I reacted made her feel bad and I was hoping there was some advice beyond ‚Äúdon‚Äôt care about the past‚Äù because clearly I do.

dating,1454tbe,1686316070.0,What should I do?,"Hello, I need some advice, I‚Äòm 25M but I never had a girlfriend and I don‚Äòt have too much experience in dating. I met this girl in my classes. Everything started when I sit next to her and then we started talking. I just saw her as a classmate, but after a few days she asked for my IG, someday she even touched my hands intentionally all of sudden, and I noticed that she approaches me more than the necessary. We laugh a lot and have good conversations together. Obviously, I started liking her, so I decided to ask her out. I did not specify if it was going to be a date or just as friends, basically I invited her to come with me to travel to a famous european city for one day and come back the same day, we live near big cities. She accepted and we traveled, we had a good time. Next weekend the same, I invited her to travel again to another city with me, and she said she would love to. The last time was good as well and we had a good time, but this time I decided to tell her that I liked her and I would like to know her more.

Honestly, I was afraid to lose her as a friend but I just said what the hell, I‚Äòll do it.

I told her literally that a friend of mine said to me to ask her (the girl I like) out because she looks cute.

Basically, she laughed and told me that WE are already spending time together and going out. This answer surprised me, I did not expect it so after that, I just said that actually I like her. She didn‚Äòt tell me that she likes me back, she just told me thank you, smiling and being nervous. She looked flattered. So she told me that she didn‚Äòt consider our travels in ‚Äûthat way‚Äú until now, but since I told her I like her, she said that now she considers them in that way. And yeah, she would like to continue hanging out more with me. This happened last weekend. 

A few days ago I ask her out again in person to travel to another city this weekend but she told me that she needs to talk with her friends because she might have plans with them this weekend. So she would let me know but today is Friday and I haven‚Äòt heard from her. Should I contact her again in case she forgot it? 

I‚Äòm so inexperienced on these things, so I don‚Äòt know if she is interesed when she told me those things or she just basically turned me down. What do you guys think?

We don‚Äòt chat via whatsapp too much, most of our conversations happen in person.","Just go slow with it, she doesn‚Äôt have to hangout with you every weekend. Talk to her the next you see her in person. But it does sound like she‚Äôs interested."

I have a job that is 'ok' i.e. I make 30k a year. One of the problems I have with dating apps is that most of the women on them are professionals, often making far more money than me. For example, I was seeing a woman for a few months recently who made about 120k a year and I'll openly admit it made me feel insecure. Has anyone else experienced this? Was the key to getting over it just managing your insecurities and dealing with them better etc, or is such a large disparity a no-no on the dating scene, especially when it's the guy making a lot less?

Thanks in advance.","it's OK to feel insecure. men are expected to make more than women, and often do depending on the profession, but realize that it's a stupid stereotype and doesn't serve anybody.

dating,1452sgy,1686310447.0,What should I do? (22F/21M),"I'm (22F) into a guy (21M) that probably knows I'm into him too (he asked me about it 4 months ago). He rejected me once, because there was someone else at that time (he's single now). Just when I was ready to move on, he started giving me more attention than I had ever expected him to give. For example last weekend when we were at a festival with a group of friends, he was clearly paying attention to me, stood or walked next to me (just the two of us a few times even), made some comments about what I said, positioned his body towards mine, made so much eye contact with me and danced really close to me, looking me in the eye the whole time. These things might seem normal, but compared to his behaviour earlier, he was a lot more attentive towards me. Even my friend said it was 100% clear he's into me. My friend has caught him staring at me often when we've met up recently.

I asked him out last week and we went out a few days ago. We spent 5 hours together, he initiated all the activities, like asked if I wanted to go to the movies (for that time, we had already talked for 3 hours). We didn't have too much physical contact, but he hugged me twice. I texted him the next day to say I had a good time and he said he had fun too. I also saw him the day after the hangout and he looked me in the eye twice and smiled (so I guess he was fine with being around me).

The problem is we can't really make the texting thing work and he hasn't made any plans for the future. I'd be okay to initiate for some time but I'm almost 100% sure he knows I see him as more than a friend and since I asked him out the first time, I feel like it's his turn now. I'd be okay to ask him out again, but I want to know for sure he sees me as more than a friend too.What do you think I should do? Any advice is welcome!","I think you‚Äôve made it perfectly clear that you‚Äôre interested, even going as far as to communicate this to him (which is the hardest part! Good job!). I think you‚Äôre right to feel that the ball should be in his court now, and it‚Äôs time for him to reciprocate if interested and make a move.

However, we men have small, very smooth brains, few wrinkles. You might need to initiate again to make it blatantly obvious. If he doesn‚Äôt initiate plans for a 3rd date it‚Äôs time to move on as he‚Äôs just stringing you along."

I (22f) just met a guy (25m) on a dating app. I saw him for the first time two weeks ago and we had a really pleasant first date. 

He was traveling for the last two weeks but still planned our date right after leaving the airport. 

Then yesterday we had a second date. The sexual tension was off the charts. I couldn‚Äôt keep my hands to myself and neither could he. We watched a movie and listened to music and I had to push him back a few times while making out because we definitely would have ended in the bedroom. I was very clear about the fact that I wanted to wait longer to have sex and he was very understanding. But then, out of nowhere I‚Äôd find myself on top of him and he‚Äôd be grinding on me. 
We went as far as dry humping and he bit my nipples‚Ä¶ Anyway, I‚Äôve never experienced this before. 
And, he‚Äôs bringing me on a third date tonight. 


I‚Äôm just scared this will make him only interested in sex. 
We discussed the option of waiting longer (3 months to be exact) and he looked fairly disappointed. I do not have the intention to wait 3 months, but I‚Äôm worried once we have sex, he won‚Äôt want to see me again or he‚Äôll get some form of post nut clarity. 
The first time I had sex with my ex, he distanced himself. He stopped talking and the next day, he called me back saying he wanted to see me again. He told me usually he detaches himself after sex whether he thinks the girl has dating potential or not and the reason he called me back is because he still enjoyed our time together after sex. Ive been worried since then that a guy will realize he‚Äôs not into me after sex. 

Any advice or opinion would be very appreciated!
Thank you!!

TLDR: The sexual tension was off the charts on the second date. I‚Äôm worried he‚Äôll have post but clarity and not want to see me after sex.","Ok, you've done the hard part and identified the core issue.

>I do not have the intention to wait 3 months, but I‚Äôm worried once we have sex, he won‚Äôt want to see me again or he‚Äôll get some form of post nut clarity.

Due to some unfortunate past experiences, it's understandable that you're going in a bit reserved. I'm detecting that you may have some problems with self-esteem and maybe self-image and I would encourage you to talk to someone to help you work through this.

I would argue that if he buggers off once you two have sex, it was never meant to be and you can keep on looking for a better fling. Dating apps aren't always ideal and I know that a lot of men will use it for 'uncommitted activities'. I would also encourage you to identify what your minimum standards are, what you're *actually* looking for, and then to not settle for anything less.

In the meantime - I'd say, why not have a bit of fun, have some hot sex, and if he buggers off so what? It wasn't meant to be, and you had a good time in the meantime. I hope this helps!"

dating,1450g45,1686302765.0,Should I give my girlfriend a chance?,"TLDR below. 

I've (26M) been dating this girl (24F) for the past 6 months. She is the most amazing person I have dated, we click in pretty much everything. For the first time I feel light in a relationship, which is great. We are already living together and things were going well.

I've been living abroad for some time now, and will be back to living with her soon. However, I noticed some red flags I cannot ignore.

She is very insecure. Can't blame her, though: she has been cheated and abused by her exes, and some horrible things happend in her past. Things she will probably never tell me, that's how bad it is. So it's no surprise she has trust issues, which have gotten worse since I came to another country.

I found out she has been checking my follows on Instagram. A few days ago, when I added some friends I met (one of which a woman), I got a text from her saying ""You better not be meeting women while you're there"". Solely based on the people I followed. And that really scared me. I have no intentions to cheat, and I understand why she is insecure, but this wasn't the first time this conversation happened. She used this threatening tone with me more than once, but when I point it out, she always says she is sorry and admits she has a problem.

She started therapy because of this issue. And said this will NEVER happen again. She wants to be better, she knows it's a problem. I want to believe she can recover, but I don't think that is going to be quick and easy. Her past is really, really dark. Not only because of crazy exes, but her whole childhood was abusive.

She has no mental illness, though. That was one of the great green flags I got since the beginning (been through some dark times due to crazy exes). But apparently being sane is not enough hahaha

So now I have to choose: either give her a chance to prove she can get better... or RUN now, soon enough so I won't get too hurt. Sure I will go through some grieving, but i would get over it.

It's been 6 months, and we are a great couple. I just don't know if I'm willing to go through the pain of waiting for her to overcome the trust issues in therapy. There's probably a lot underneath those ""small"" red flags that I still don't see.

There hasn't been a major dealbreaker yet, but I don't know if I should wait to see if there will be.

Tldr: me (26M) and 6 months GF (24F). She could be ""the one"". But she has trust issues and a pretty dark and traumatic childhood. She started therapy and all, but I don't feel it's gonna be that easy. There hasn't been a major dealbreaker yet, but I don't know if I should wait to see if there will be.",Personally i would give her a chance. Thats something she can grow out of for sure

However the other day she said ""I love you"" while we were mid adult-fun-time. She had orgasmed a few times at this point and was close to another so I just assumed she wasn't thinking straight and I just replied by telling her how beautiful she is etc. She said it again in the session but again I just showered her with loving words and moved on.

But then she said it again the day after while we were just chatting and I panicked.

Why would she say that? She knows we don't plan on ever meeting in person (her own rule not mine).

The worst part is I used to struggle not to say it to her sometimes (while we were having sexy time and while we were talking normally). So now I'm even more on edge!

I know she doesn't mean it because she doesn't want to meet irl. She knows I have fun with other people sometimes, and I know she does too. That doesn't sound like an ""I love you"" kind of situation to me...

dating,144zrx8,1686300451.0,Just need someone advice üôè,"Very long post, but please read through. I really need someone to drill sense in my head.ü•≤

Soo, I've been dating this guy since past three months. And we both agreed on keeping it casual. Though I was reluctant at first but events agreed because I like him so much. He is really nice and I really really like talking to him and i guess this is mutual.

Now I've noticed something. Whenever he talks to me and everything is going good, I don't feel the urge to message him all day long. Infact sometimes I also daydream about the future that what if I don't end up with him( and I'm not really scared about it, like it doesn't make me feel agitated as if he's the last guy). 

But as soon as even jokes about ignoring me or just doesn't to talk to me because he's busy due to genuine reasons,my god I just get so worked up. Though I try my best to not show it to him. I've to fight the urge to message him. Like if he's told me he's busy, i just want to not msg him at all ,but ughhh. 

Like recently he had his exams and i told him that he can msg/call me whenever he's free. And i only msgd him to wish him luck. But he didn't msg me at all. Like I get it, you're busy. But how long does it take to say hi. And he had the time to go to friend's birthday and get drunk. And during this time he also installed bumble.  And this entire situation made me just so sad, it felt like someone was digging their fingers in my brain. Nonetheless I spoke to him about it and he explained the entire situation about exams. And about bumble he said he just downloaded to see how it is and uninstalled it later(i still don't know how to feel about it, nonetheless I just ignore it).

So I just want to know why does this happen? Like why do I get so so worked up about it? I mean I'm an overthinker and i can't even focus on anything else when i feel like he might be ignoring me.  How do I avoid it?

Also does it happen to all the women? Like if a guy you like, ignores you do you feel that same agitation? And even if you try to ignore them back you just end up messaging them because you can't take it?",

We met up again at a pub after she drunk texted me. We danced and made out. She asked me if I liked her and I said yes. I also asked her if she liked me and she said yes.

I asked her if she was uncomfortable on Saturday because I was drunk as well. She explained that our lifestyles didn‚Äôt match and she would feel bad to continue because I had been good to her and she had been really comfortable talking to me. She said we would continue talking.

The reason I decided to set up the age range between 30 and 40 despite me being in my early 20s is because I cannot conect with girls around my age (18-22). 

I'm very serious, and quiet. Once a time a female classmate, who is 19, told me I give ""old man"" vibes. 

I think that's the reason why girls of my age don't want to date me. They want someone more youthful. But I am not like that. But also I'm not an old man.

I don't know I think I'm little confused. I only have had one serious relationship, and she was 19; very modest and christian girl. But now it seems I cannot attract someone similar.

This last date I don't know what happened and suddenly my plans weren't going well. There was also not much to talk about and I am having a hard time coming up with a topic so I just asked questions randomly about our relationship and so on. Like is it going well etc. It wasn't that bad but there was moments where it would just be quiet but I just thought it was one of those days.

The next day we planned to eat or just drop her off at home if she was tired. She said is it okay if we just skip dinner.  I said it's okay 3 times since she said sorry 3 times. I said who am I to complain after her saying sorry the 3rd time. My intention wasn't bad it was just I didn't want her to feel sorry for skipping dinner. I guess her saying sorry 3 times made me say it. She was very sorry and it was okay with me since there will be a next time.

The next day came and I said good morning she didn't reply anymore. There was something I said that turned her off I am not sure but when I asked her she said none and she just didn't feel a connection and personalities didn't jive that much. 

I feel like I said something still that turned her off. Did I define relationship too much ? Ask too many questions ? Didn't ask that much which resulted to quiet moments ? Was I rude when I said who am I to complain ? Not enough confidence when I she asked what I would do if someone else was entertaining her ? I can name more but can't remember.

A lot of people are saying just forget it and move on and it's her lost you didn't do anything bad don't overthink it you did your best don't blame yourself etc.

How should I react if I may have ruined my relationship ?  Should I forgive myself for not doing my best or forgive myself for my best wasn't enough ? Should I feel guilty ? Should I be ashamed of myself ? 

I am feeling very guilty for ruining the relationship if I said something. I didn't even mean it and my intetion wasn't bad. I just wanted to know and not have awkward silence.

But the thing is the nights one of us doesn't ask for sexts and nudes, we still talk to each other and even during the day like she and i send good morning messages 

One of the days she recommended me and made me in a cute forceful way watch a movie she loved and asked me about it. The next day she again told me to watch another movie and watched the show that i told her. And in general we just talk and be goofy and talk bout our days when not being horny.

Last night while we started doing it she stopped and told me that she cried at school and i asked her and she told me that she felt that no one would love her and she's a burden. I tried to comfort her and she told me more.  Then i asked her to not apologise and we can talk. She told me the reason then said that she was on call with a friend for an hour and she helped her calm down but then we texted at night a lil and she joked about us suffering together cause of how we'll be asleep tom.

Also i realised that when we are flirty and she asks me how long I want her and i say forever jk well she doesn't dispute it and flirts back. And lastly i asked her a few times about if she got other fwbs but she says only got time for one guy(me). She also takes my advice and even said about  how she would not go to a party if i ask her not to lmao

Ps: in the day we usually reply to each other in 20-40 mins if we are awake and at night we non stop reply. Yea so ik i am falling for her i wanna know if u think she is too and we have admitted to loving each other's company as well.

Thank you for your opinion. I really appreciate you",

dating,144wphm,1686289833.0,Why are dating apps full of people that don't want to date?,"I can only speak to my experiences as a guy dating women, but this seems to be something that is becoming more and more common by the day. My last relationship (we matched on Tinder), ended after she pulled the all too common ""Im not ready for a relationship"" card. Ive talked to a couple of girls since, and both say similar things, exhibiting pretty much identical behavior.

Matched with a lady on Facebook Dating, instant chemistry, clicked amazingly well, things were going fantastic, after a couple of weeks, she says she's got too much going on in her life and doesn't think she has the time or energy for a relationship. 

A couple of weeks ago, I matched with a girl on Bumble. She messages me, she initiates, we start talking, get along fabulously, go on a couple of dates, talk on the phone every night, have those important first discussions about what we're looking for in a partner, a vision for our future, what we want in a really, etc. We're on the same wavelength. Then earlier tonight, we're talking on the phone, and out of nowhere, she tells me that she's probably getting ready to move out of state to pursue a job. What??

This is absolutely blowing my mind, and I know this isn't unique to me, as I see lots and lots of guys posting about similar instances on here every day. What is going on with this stuff? Do these girls just want some temporary attention and then move on when they get their fill? I really don't get it.","Sorry to be blunt but these people want to date, only not with you.   
Also, they might want to date only for casual things, nothing serious. If they feel you're developing feelings for them, they might cut things loose.   
They might also realize after a few weeks that you're not a good match and so, they decide it's better to breakup and give face saving justifications.     
They could also have found a better suitor and decide to jump ships.

That's just the hard truth of dating, especially on online platforms where women get infinitely more matches than men.   
For your own sanity, meet people the good ol'way."

- opens the door for me when I‚Äôm walking with him/holds the elevator open with his hand blocking it for me to get on. Think people can sense it as he‚Äôs not like that with other people‚Ä¶.

- when his coworkers made a mess for me to clean up the following morning, he was the only one who apologies for the mess. Further in that day, after his meeting he proceeded to stay back to clean while his coworkers were going to leave it for me. He then proceeded to say ‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry, I cleaned up‚Äù with a wink. I‚Äôm a receptionist so do a lot of cleaning after meetings‚Ä¶.
- smiles mutually back at each other passing each other and hi‚Äôs, followed by him looking back at me smiling. 
- winks bye to me when getting off the elevator (almost like a subtle sign when other people got off and he was last to get off) or when he‚Äôs with someone and their talking so he can‚Äôt talk
-waves hi from across the street with his lunch friends and smiles walking past each other
- seems nervous just as much as me, almost like he gets awkward when I walk in the room and stares at me and can‚Äôt stop looking at me
- Followed me on our work platform
 
Almost like we have this connection without much talking as he‚Äôs always with other people.

And yes he knows how I feel about PDA and all that and he still literally always does it. Even when I am obviously very annoyed by it and verbally telling him to cut it out. Still does. All. the. Time.
In a addition, he comes over to spend the night and then just like stays for days on end. I mean I do enjoying his company but like I need some of my day to my self. Like go home and I feel like I make it super obvious that I want him to like just go home for a bit but idk
I really liked him alot I thought and my sister and the rest of my family like him a lot and we are Facebook official and literally every time he speaks to me now I just get the ick. Help me.

I've always been very attracted to overweight women, and I can count on just one hand the amount of girls that I found remotely attractive in my years at school.

I work full time, trying to get a better job so I can move out on my own, and I keep thinking about the future. When I really think about it, I've always fantasized about gaining a little weight with someone, being fat and happy together. I like reading stories or looking at art with this topic, and I used to always feel hopeful and excited about the future. Now they just make me feel very sad and lonely. I'm worried that I'll never get to share that with someone and it scares the hell out of me.

I guess I'm writing this cause I have no idea where to begin. I've never kissed a girl, asked anyone out before, any of that stuff. Sex education for teenage me was a small religious book and a lecture to ""stay away from porn"". I joined a dating site for people into fat/weight gain a few years ago, and besides the fact that it's every bit as shitty as any other dating platform, I'm just so damn shy. I rarely check it anymore.

I'm already thinking of a few changes I can make. I go to therapy weekly and could talk about this, could try new hobbies, start exercising and improve my mood and libido. I've acknowledged I'll probably be better off dating a girl I meet in person, and opening up to her about what I want as the relationship progresses. But that brings us back to the heart of the issue: **I have no idea how to date in the first place.**",maybe get your testosterone levels checked.
dating,144rpsj,1686274839.0,Bummed out,"I was previously in a long, toxic relationship. I have since been single for a long time. I was really excited when I met this new guy. immediately I was very attracted to him, and I could sense he was attracted to me also. We went on a date. I thought it went well with a few exceptions of odd things he said. 
We talked about going out again. He started being very wishy washy. Randomly, he called me and told me he was seeing someone else. I was pretty upset. Months later, he bumped into me and asked me out. We slept together that night. I felt horrible because apparently he was still dating that other girl. I slept with him a couple times after that, (please, I don‚Äôt need to hear that I‚Äôm an awful person. I already felt really shitty about myself). I decided to tell him I can‚Äôt do this anymore.  It was messing with me really bad. I felt like a shell of a human being. worthless. 

Honestly, I just need advice. Why do I 
 miss this guy. Why do I want his attention? Why is he cheating on his girlfriend?  I just feel like I‚Äôm never going to find true love.","Nobody is going to shame you here. You acknowledge that it wasn't a good decision which is good. This guy sounds no good though, I would steer clear. Even if he did end up with you he'd more than likely cheat on you too."
dating,144ri02,1686274226.0,What do you think the ratio is of people you have a connection with?,"I‚Äôve been reflecting on my dating habits over the past year and have been having this overwhelming frustration that a spark/connection seems so hard to find, at least on my end. To the best of my memory I‚Äôve gone on dates with 16 people in the last year and a half. I‚Äôve only felt a genuine spark with 2 of them (neither turned into a relationship). 

I‚Äôm wondering what other people‚Äôs ratios are? 

I hear often it is a bit of a numbers game so I‚Äôm wondering if I am choosing the wrong people to go on dates with or if this is a pretty normal ratio of first dates to connection.","eh I think it's really too broad of a spectrum to find an accurate answer. I had a connection with the first girl I met off hinge and we haven't looked back since. Really is just all chance, especially if you're online dating cause people can be completely different over text and in person."

I‚Äôm getting worried I‚Äôll die alone at this point or that I‚Äôm too old for anyone to actually love me lol I know that sounds crazy but it‚Äôs how I feel. I‚Äôve always been insecure and I don‚Äôt believe anyone will ever actually love me. I‚Äôve had people hit on me before but never with good intentions. At this point I‚Äôm just worried I‚Äôll be alone forever. I enjoy being independent and I have many friendships I treasure but should I be seeking out my other half? Is it so bad to be single forever? Am I too old to even be dating? Honestly if I‚Äôm still a single Virgin by 27 Ima just give up and love myself only lol,"Your 25! You only just turned old enough to rent a car. You aren't weird for not dating or having a relationship until now, it is wayyy more common than you'd think. It's also safe to say  that you sound like your own worst enemy. If you want a partner then go find one, they're out there somewhere. You're never too old for anything. 

A word of warning though, because you're inexperienced it will be very easy for you to get attached to someone you think could be the one. Just be weary and don't rush anything."
dating,144r9fp,1686273566.0,Is my coworker interested and should I ask her out,"So I have a coworker who is shy, as in she can't go to places alone and usually always says she has no plans for the weekend. She has been wanting to go places but she says she is too shy to go alone. 

Recently we have gotten closer and talk a decent amount. She seems relatively comfortable now sharing personal things with me, stuff she sometimes says she hasnt mentioned that to anyone else yet. She also seems interested in me and my hobbies (she will ask alot of questions during our conversations and has indicated she wanted me to teach her a video game i play) 

At one point i did flirt by gently grabbing and holding her arm when asking about a bracelet and after i did this she invited me to touch her other arm. I do have her number but I am unsure if she actually likes me or is just friendly to me at work. Initially she did make the first approach to talk to me but since we have started talking more she never initiates conversation both in person or text. Usually we will be walking and she will be next to me or near me but she will never start the conversation. I always do start the conversation after a bit and she is responsive and prolongs the convo. 

I am just unsure if she is just being nice and friendly at work when I talk to her or if she is actually interested in me since she never initiates conversation with me or never texts me either.",
dating,144qyjk,1686272719.0,Why is it so hard to find a woman without tattoos?,"As an individual with a personal preference, I have made the decision not to pursue romantic relationships with women who have tattoos.

Anyway over the last week he has been relatively pushy about turning it into a serious relationship which I completely understand, though he knows of my situation and I explained to him why I wanted to wait a bit longer. Now he‚Äôs starting to ask me if I‚Äôm feeling overwhelmed by him and if I want to continue when I tell him I can‚Äôt hangout, he also said he loved me even though we‚Äôre not dating, and tonight I told him I didn‚Äôt want to hangout (I traveled today and am exhausted, plus I have work in the morning) but after I said that he posted on his story a song called ‚ÄúNUMB‚Äù and a quote saying ‚Äúyou deserve to be loved and chosen - not almost loved and almost chosen.‚Äù It‚Äôs a good quote but it just makes me feel like shit and kind of gives me the ick if that makes sense. 

Is this a red flag? Or am I just an asshole?","He‚Äôs attached to you and he‚Äôs trying to cope. It‚Äôs tough to be in his situation and yours, but you have to decide whether you want to end it so he can move on or give him some reassurance about where you see the relationship going."

I usually don't even get past the chatting stage. I will find red flags. For example love bombing, lying, abusive language etc.

In my past I have picked mostly abusive men. They would come on strong and eventually it led to that. However even chatting I have noticed men coming on strong and then being abusive with their language. Not being self aware is another issue and narcissistic.

How do I find a decent human? Dating sites I have given up on. Has anyone else noticed a lack of empathy?

She just replied. So... how long should I wait to write back? A day or two? Or sooner because I don't want to play games?","The messaging phase is just one aspect of the dating ritual, and yet another hurdle to add to all the traditional hurdles where things can go wrong.  If you want to keep your options as wide as possible my advice would normally be to match their energy at this point, the trouble is we don't know what her energy is, whether this is quite typical or there were extenuating circumstances.  

At this point I would probably message sooner rather than later, while at the same time I would definitely not be hanging onto any hopes that anything will happen, so I would continue messaging/finding others."

dating,144ph20,1686268708.0,Nice guy problem,"Basically, I feel like I'm too nice, especially to people who don't deserve it. Society, and the environment where I grew up, expects me to be tough. Let me explain further. I didn't grow up in a rough neighborhood or anything, but my school has a predominantly Black and Hispanic population. Many of the guys there strive to portray a tough, gangsta image, although not all the time. I, on the other hand, am the opposite of those guys.  
  
There was this girl I liked, and here's the thing‚ÄîI couldn't bring myself to approach her because we were so different. We had different styles of dressing, different ways of speaking, and hung out with different crowds. I believe she might have had some interest in me too, but I couldn't overcome the intense male competition. Other guys saw me as a joke or believed she could do better. It's embarrassing to admit, but I felt like they were deliberately trying to undermine me, waiting for my failure. It's cringe-worthy to say out loud, but that's genuinely how I felt. In the end, she ended up being with someone who resembled her more, and that was the end of it. The school year concluded with me being alone, as usual.","The real tough guys in the world don't act or dress like it. The guys who do are compensating for some sort of insecurity they have in their life. Those types will want you to fail, not because you're not good enough but because they see someone who doesn't have to put the tough guy act on to succeed and that challenges their ego because they feel entitled.

Intelligent women have a much better radar for this kind of act. Especially if they've been in relationships with those guys before. So she probably liked you because you weren't like that. The older you get the more people realise this. High school caters to those guys but in real life they're loosers.

Shoot. Your. Shot my guy!"
dating,144p39j,1686267739.0,On-line dating,I've been talking to a guy for about a week and a half and he asked to meet up.

Then a while later he texted back and said he'd really rather have lunch but would have dinner if I really wanted and wanted to make sure we each paid for ourselves. What are female's perspectives on this behavior?,"Male here.

I think you suggesting a drink is perfectly reasonable, that is definitely be my preference for a first date, no question about it.  I do think it is a bit weird that he suggested dinner, then went back to suggesting lunch (which you didn't want to do in the first place), then started wanting assurances that you are going to pay your own way... from the way you've described it, he sounds difficult to me!  

I don't want to tell you to blow the whole thing off, but I would probably blow the whole thing off üòÅ"
dating,144oztx,1686267500.0,Can‚Äôt stop over-thinking how to handle paying the cheque after a date,"The thought of the potential awkwardness that might occur when the cheque comes actually prevents me from going on dates. I am so in my head about who should pay, how to offer, etc, etc. I, being a female, know that it is not uncommon for men to offer to take the cheque (which I am not opposed to), but the uncertainty of whether they will offer, or if I should offer, or how to handle it, is actually crippling.

My boyfriend is always asking me to pay for stuff and buy him things. Sometime these things can be very expensive. For example, he asked me to buy him a birthday gift that costs over $350 dollars. For me, thats a lot of money, but maybe to him it isn‚Äôt. 

I don‚Äôt have much relationship experience so i don‚Äôt know if this is normal, but not once have i ever asked him to pay for or get me anything. I would feel uncomfortable doing that. He would also jokingly ask me to give him money and get ‚Äúfake‚Äù mad when i wouldn‚Äôt. Maybe i‚Äôm not picking up on his sarcasm, but sometimes i really feel like he isn‚Äôt joking.",No it‚Äôs not ok. He sounds like a user and because you don‚Äôt ask him for anything he‚Äôs gotten the idea that It‚Äôs okay to ask you and that you‚Äôll give in. Stand up for yourself and stop letting him do this he should not feel comfortable enough to be saying this
dating,144oqvh,1686266856.0,I (26f) got ghosted by a guy (26m) after him constantly putting in effort for a month.,"I‚Äôm freshly out of a 9 year relationship. My dating history is small compared to most. I‚Äôve always been in a relationship so I‚Äôm not used to dating and talking to new people. But after I decided to cut it off with my ex. (I wanted more form him, he couldn‚Äôt do that). And let this guy. He works right next to me at another bar and would stop in for a beer before work. We‚Äôre both bartenders with a drinking problem. So I would see him occasionally but one day I walked up to him and spoke to him. After that he slowly started coming more and more. We lightly talked and flirted because I would also have a drink after work. When he was having his before work beer. Only 30 minute intervals. He would come exactly at 4:30 and had work at 5:00. The flirting continued and I started sitting with him daily. Same time and same drinks. I liked that he was dominant. He Knew what I was drinking and when he saw that I was getting ready to get off he would order us a round of shots for me to sit with him. He sat in the one chair I always wound before him. So when we started drinking he would sit there and move over when I was off, saving my seat for me. He started coming every. Single. Day. To see me. We worked the same shifts exactly. To everyday I worked I saw him. Same thing. Drinks and flirting. It was crazy because I constantly sat there, receiving. He always paid for my shots. For a month straight. He came everyday, sometimes earlier to spend more time with me, and bought me my drinks daily. He created a whole habit. Bc it takes at least 30 days to form a habit. (Backstory) I‚Äôm a artist who does vendor events, he insisted coming and I was fine with him not coming because he has given me flaky behavior before. And I tried to give him a out to not coming or making it. I told him it‚Äôs fine if you can come, I know you have work that night and it‚Äôs early ( he works the night bar scene so he doesn‚Äôt get off till 2) he insisted it was fine and he would make it. He is the one who invited himself I never gave him any pressure. So the day before we‚Äôre texting and he doesn‚Äôt reply after me. The next day is my event, he doesn‚Äôt show up and never texted me. Like I said I just got out of a relationship I wasn‚Äôt giving him any pressure, but he could of at least texted me. It is now a month later and I never ever got a response from him since the night before my event. The day after my event was a Sunday we both had work. And he didn‚Äôt show up for our scheduled drinks. It has been a month and I haven‚Äôt heard from him. He has came in twice to my job when he knew I wasn‚Äôt working. He follows me on Instagram and looked me up and also followed me on my business Instagram. He has watched all my stories and liked my Instagram post. He keeps up with me. 
Me being new to dating I‚Äôve never been ghosted before. It‚Äôs been super confusing fire me to navigate. How can someone put in sooooo much effort and then nothing. What do you think it means that he still keeps up with me ? What do you think happened and if he didn‚Äôt really care would he still be watching my stuff?","He probably thinks he screwed everything up by missing your event and is avoiding you now. 

If you want to find out what's up DM him on instagram and invite him out for drinks. Don't be all ""why did you ghost me"", just try to have a casual meeting. He'll probably spill the beans. 

If you don't care, then just block him so you don't have to think about it anymore."

Just still devastated and made worse by the fact she still seems to want to get in contact with me and make excuses to message - any ideas on why she does this? Speaking more broadly, why did she not love me back? Why did I fail in my deepest desire? Why do I not get to win at love when all my friends do?

dating,144oemw,1686266016.0,"Parted ways on good terms with FWB six weeks ago. However, one night when we were drinking, she said something that has been consuming my mind since","Currently laying in bed off from work and I am not sure I can talk to anyone about this.

Originally met this great gal [29F] [29M] at the start of 2022. We hit it off on the first date and the sexual chemistry was amazing, so we starting seeing each other casually. That lasted about 4 months and was a great experience. 

At the start of this year I got burnt out of dating with purpose. Sort of felt like my time and energy wasn't received or reciprocated very well. I was looking for something casual and reached out to her, she was interested in my proposition.

This time around, it was far more intense in just about every way, alot happened. I truly enjoyed spending time with her because I felt I could be myself. For example we both opened up to each other and shared tough stories of our past, which I normally don't unless I'm comfortable. I've only done this with two of my long term ex GFs for example.

To recall on that night when we were blind drunk: We were discussing the two of us moving foward, as in a potential relationship. Towards the end of the conversation she uttered the words ""you can't offer me nothing"". I remember going quiet, essentially shutting down my willingness to communicate. That next morning, things didn't feel the same. We ended things respectfully.

Yet another big surgery lies around the corner for me and hopefully the last. I moved back in with my dad in 2019 when I had my first major surgery and missed alot of time away from work. I had no other option and knew it was for the best to for me to not kill my savings and build more, which I have been doing. 

The main point being is, I opened up and explained all of this to her (how I deal with it and what my long-term goals are). This is a big insecurity of mine and am always umcomfortable talking about it. I thought she was aware of that.

I'm not sure why I wrote this but i'm in a bad place mentally and physically right now. I had so much respect for her and that's why I was vulnerable. I'm not sure I can be vulnerable like that again.

Really feel like a loser at the moment because I dont have my own place at 29. I do understand why this is unattractive to women. You should expect a guy of that age to have his stuff together.

However, what she said really destroyed my confidence and future desires for dating all around. Or maybe this was something I need to hear. 

I have been self-reflecting alot lately and I need to work on heaps of things. My main focus is getting properly healthy and smashing goals, the main one is independence.

A big thankyou if you got to the end of this word vomit. Be as honest and blunt as you want with me. I'd appreciate any type of feedback. 

Tldr; FWB who I had alot of respect for said ""you can't offer me nothing"" in regards to a realtionship. I had previously opened up to her about my past and present struggles with my health. In turn this has destroyed my confidence.",I don‚Äôt think I could date a woman who says ‚Äúcan‚Äôt offer me nothing‚Äù. Terrible grammar
dating,144oe68,1686265982.0,Found someone. Really happy for once. What I‚Äôve realized,"I‚Äôm a pretty introverted dude. I wouldn‚Äôt say a total loner but typically, I prefer my own company. Dating had always been hard because I overthink quite a bit and was introverted. I finally met someone about 6 months ago and we‚Äôve been dating for 4. I‚Äôve realized that the people you are meant to be with will develop naturally and if you find yourself overthinking a lot, it‚Äôs probably not meant to be. I haven‚Äôt overthought anything with this. We just seem to get each other. Yes, it‚Äôs still relatively new but just wanted to say for all the people struggling, find your own happiness first. I was really happy with being a single dude when we met. I was and still am going to the gym a lot, producing music, working full time and just enjoyed life. I realized that when I came across like I was looking for someone, people picked up on it and was the opposite of a magnet. Just find what allows you to enjoy life and be yourself. You‚Äôd be surprised what happens when you stop focusing on finding someone. It sounds cliche, but sometimes a cliche is a cliche for a reason. I realize I had spent so much time wallowing in loneliness and it‚Äôs embarrassing in retrospect. But we all live and learn. We all make mistakes but we have to learn from them. So to anyone struggling out there, find what you love to do and focus on that, not finding someone. Your person will come along when you least expect it. Just be open to opportunities and not narrow minded and everything will work out.",thank you for shining such beautiful white light

Mainly and simply looking for sites people recommend.  Not looking for hookups. More looking for areas to chat and get to know people. Also maybe some profile/photo suggestions. I absolutely abhore taking photos but understand that's the way now. 

I'm INFJ so while I'm not shy I'm not open about asking someone out. I connect with too many people too quickly so realize it's best to just not ask people out. And I honestly cannot judge age anymore. Thanks. 

Sorry if I missed a post for this as I did look so if someone could link it I'll send cookies.","Hire a photographer to take your profile pics. Go for a couple different locations. 

If you have any friends of your target gender, get them to review your bio.

All the sites/apps are essentially the same - a jungle. Glance through this sub a bit more and be prepared. Don't take any of it personally. 

Remember that asking someone out, going on dates, flirting, etc.. are all skills that you can develop and improve at.

Would you expect to be told by the person you're dating so that you're aware?,"Generally, if you haven't had an exclusivity conversation, then both parties should assume they're not exclusive. This also doesn't hurt to be clear and direct about, though, because there are people who go on dates one at a time with the expectation of something serious. Being communicative is just always a good idea. If it doesn't work out - then you've successfully avoided wasting everyone's time on an incompatible relationship! 

If you are sleeping with multiple people, you should always be open about that because it's a matter of sexual health and people have the right to all the information necessary to make an informed decision about their health."

dating,144ngwe,1686263736.0,How should I move forward? Does this count as getting stood up or just bad situation?,"How to move forward with this? Don‚Äôt know if this counts as getting stood up or just circumstances.

So me and this girl go to same college or did as I am transferring now. We knew of eachother for almost 8 months but never got really close despite hanging within a group of friends. I had not seen her in a few months but happen to run into eachother last day of semester. We talked hanged out that day and continued to text over the next week. I ask her out and she agrees. 

First Date goes amazing. One more week of texting and second date happens, goes good again. Both lasted around 5 hours with multiple places included. We plan our third date for Today and continue texting throughout the week. This texting she seems way more into it and enthusiastic than normal which was a good sign to me. 

As you know the Canada fire happens, and NYC gets killed with smoke and makes the outside unbearable. While texting I bring up the fact of the weather as our date was for an outdoors event. She says she‚Äôs unsure about our date tomorrow because of the weather and we agree to check tomorrow how it is. 
So tomorrow happens, today(The day of date) and we text in the morning as usual and I ask her what she was thinking of the weather and that I could go today or wait for the weekend if she felt uncomfortable. She doesn‚Äôt respond to that for 4 hours and the time of the date is coming up, so I double text to tell her we should go during the weekend as the air quality is still bad unless she‚Äôs not free then we‚Äôll go today and to let me know if we‚Äôre still going today as the event is an hour away from me so I could start making my way there. Doesn‚Äôt respond until she gets off work that she‚Äôs so sorry and that she got busy at work and that she‚Äôll let me know for The Weeknd. 
I haven‚Äôt responded yet and basically in my mind this is her trying to let me down. How should I move forward with this? Should I just put the ball in her court. So far I‚Äôve been initiating most of the texting but she‚Äôs been responding well and everything been going great up until now. Should I continue texting her in the morning tomorrow like I always do or just stop contact all together and let her make all the plans and initiate contact? I usually text her good morning lol. Should I just continue as everything is normal but not bring up the date at all?","As a woman it just sounds like she just needs time to herself and doesn't know how to communicate it. She is most likely not standing you up. I know for me I like to just chill by myself sometimes even if I really like a person, or if I'm experiencing a lot of anxiety I just need to collect myself. It sounds like a throat chakra imbalance where she can't communicate what she feels to you. She likes you. Just give her space to breathe. Yeah send that morning text but if you can feel any sense of being passive aggressive, process that before you text her. Consistency is comforting and security. If she doesn't respond to that text, let it breathe and don't double text her."
dating,144ng3w,1686263685.0,I never got a date,"By the way I've never done anything, not kissing, hugging or anything with a girl, I feel really behind because I'm almost 27 years old, but at least I look much younger, I can't imagine winning any girl's heart, to be honest I never did it to win anyone's heart, I was always insecure about myself, in my adolescence I even had some opportunities I never took advantage of, now that doesn't even appear. I even feel awkward in interactions with strangers because I'm so shy and quiet that nothing useful or interesting ever comes out of my mouth when it's time to socialize, at my job girls are nice to me (probably out of good manners) and I feel strange since normally girls were very mean to me during school and college, I was bullied. I probably, if I don't make the effort to change this self-sabotaging behavior of mine, I shouldn't be complaining about never having had a date but honestly I don't think I'm prepared mentally and physically because I still want to change a lot of things in my body and face.",Are you working with a therapist?
dating,144neg5,1686263582.0,Being ghosted sucks so much,"Had a first date that i thought went really well. It was just a coffee date but we ended up talking for like three hours. We were laughing a lot and we had a lot of similar past experiences and interests. It was a really good time and I thought she was really enjoying herself too cuz she was laughing and smiling a lot. 

We keep texting the day after and then I ask her on another date. She apologizes saying sorry she‚Äôs busy this weekend. We keep talking then a couple days later I ask next weekend. Bam! Left on read. Been four days since then. I can see that she‚Äôs still active online. Now I realize the ‚Äòim busy‚Äô was just a light way of letting me off. 

Being ghosted sucks so much cuz theres no closure. Ive only been on one date with this girl so in that regards its not that bad. But now ill never know what went wrong. And ik thats gonna haunt me for a long time. I wish ppl were more upfront. I wish she told me why shes no longer interested. Now im always gonna wonder if it was something i said or did, if it was something else. Next time im talking to a girl all ill be able to think about is what if im doing something wrong again. And it wont help if it looks like shes having a good time cuz thats how it was with this girl too. I can already feel it eating away at me. 

Ive been thinking today of sending a follow up text. Just like ‚Äòhey hope all is good. I was just wondering jf i could know what went wrong with us‚Äô, or something like that, but my friends advised against it. I dont know how else to get closure though. What do u guys think?",Therapy is the only way. Ghosting does suck. But therapy will explain why you attracted this. I'm really sorry you did get ghosted. It's so inconsiderate. I used to do it. I'm ashamed to admit it. Now I choose to be very clear about not wanting to continue any form of relationship. The joke about getting ghosted is that everytime the confusion or pain or you think about them comes up it's like their a ghost haunting you. Make peace with the ghost
dating,144n9xc,1686263292.0,Just being polite?,"Went on a first date today with a guy I really dig. Conversation went well, there were no weird pauses and I found myself feeling really comfortable around him. 

We talked a bit about everything from cats to family to being non religious. Something I noticed was that he wanted to answer the question about who he was (he assumed I asked, though I didn‚Äôt mean to imply it) and that he helped me out when I needed his hand and we joked around a bit. 

He‚Äôs introverted, calm and relaxed for the most part but somehow so energetic at the same time. Hard to read because I have  no idea whether he‚Äôs just easy going with everyone. He told me he thought I was so very nice, almost too lovely as if I was holding back something (I was and I wasn‚Äôt‚Ä¶ when I‚Äôm feeling shy I try to be extra, extra kind and not as sarcastic as my usual self) and he wasn‚Äôt sure what it was. By the end of the date, he was in a bit of a hurry said ‚Äòwe‚Äôll text, thanks for the company.‚Äô Gave me a hug and sped off (he was late to see a friend) 

Was he just being polite? Or did he mean that we would indeed text? Why not ask for a second date if it went well? 

There was something about him that felt so comfortable and familiar and I‚Äôd find it a pity to not hear from him again. I‚Äôd be glad to message first myself but I don‚Äôt want to make anyone feel uncomfortable if he really was just being polite",Wait for him to text before over-thinking. If you don't hear from him for a day or two then question. Also it's totally fine to text a guy after a date.
dating,144n9sn,1686263282.0,Break up,"I'm in my first year of college going into my second in the fall. I've been real close friends with this girl. I've had feeling for her since the start but pushed that aside for the benefit of the friend group. At this time it's been over
7-8 months and her friend tells me discreetly she has started getting feelings for me right before the school year is ending. I didn't want to pursue anything since it would affect the group but I made the first move to break the ice and as the finals ended we spend time talking and getting to know each other more deeply.
Fast forward for now, it's been a month and 1/2 since that and we've been talking, FaceTime, etc every day. I started getting feeling for her and she has dropped the ball of her wanting to end this. She has been not been putting in the effort like he had normally done so for the past week so ik this was coming. She made me change who I am and l've done it for her just to continue this relationship. I wanted to confront her with how I was feeling and after not responding to me she dropped this message.
""i'm sorry (name) i'm just a little busy tonight. i value you as a person but right now i don't think that we should be anything more than just friends. i don't think it's gonna work out for us in the long run and i'd rather stop it before we ruin our friendship. and i just don't think i want a romantic relationship right now or anything serious.""
It's the next day now and she has responded to me by wanting to talk, and dosent want to make me upset. I've assumed the best thing to do is just leave it be as it seems she has been using me for attention this whole time and got me thinking she actually had feelings for me.
I've spoken to some of my other friends and they seem to agree with all the context I showed them, but I want to hear for some other opinions, before I talk to her. Thank you.","I think you're hurt and so prone to being uncharitable about her actions. She liked you, but she realized she values the friendship and integrity of the friendship group more than a potential romantic relationship. That doesn't at all mean she was using you. It means she was also caught up in her feelings, like you, but just came to a different conclusion on how to handle them.

Remember, closure is the gift you give yourself. I'm not sure why a discussion is necessary, but please think long and hard before saying anything that could harm the friendship, such as throwing about baseless accusations."

dating,144mvx4,1686262353.0,Group Exercise Classes,"Has anyone had success stories meeting each other in settings like group fitness classes? Example: yoga, Pilates, boxing, CrossFit etc etc

People consistently suggest group fitness classes/meetups as great ways to meet potential partners.

Just trying to brainstorm other ways of meeting people rather than the apps. Thanks!","Okay, we really need to address this advice people throw out to ""join hobby groups"" as a way of dating.

We're overusing it in a way it was never meant to be utilized.

Reasons why you should join hobby groups:

* To socialize
* To have fun
* To find community
* To get out of the house
* To spend time on yourself and the things you enjoy
* Good for your mental health
* Developing sense of self

Reasons that are **not** good reasons to join hobby groups:

* To date

The reason why joining hobby groups is such a common suggestion is because a lot of people - and this is a fault of how society has been set up more than it may be a personal choice - looking for dates...have no personality. They sit at home browsing the internet and playing video games 24/7 and do literally nothing else. They never really developed a sense of self or figured out what they liked beyond the internet, and they don't do anything offline to interact with others.

Are hobby groups a great way to meet others? Yes! But they're much better for platonic social needs. *Can* this lead to romantic/sexual encounters? Yeah, that absolutely happens. But that should NOT be how you use hobby groups.

You should go to a hobby group because you enjoy or think you might enjoy doing that thing with other people who enjoy doing it. *If*, on the rare and low and off-chance, that leads to a date *one day down the road after you've made friends and been a part of the group for a while* \- good for you! But that's not the purpose of a hobby group and utilizing it like such is only bound to end in bitterness and anger. Even if you enjoy that hobby, you may even end up ruining the hobby for yourself when you rely on it for dates instead of for self-fulfillment and entertainment.

People may also suggest hobby groups because more serious dates are likely to manifest from friendships and acquaintances than from meeting strangers. But this is a long game of patience, and you *cannot* go into it expecting dates. That's already a thing that destroys friendships and makes people - very reasonably - feel used.

Keep this in mind when you see people suggesting these as ways to meet people. They are indeed great ways to meet people. But they are not dating events. If you specifically want dating interactions, then stick to places fostering this - dating apps, speed dating, singles events, matchmakers, etc."

I m no pro but I have no problems in getting dates but I m inexperienced in long term relationships and want one. My relationships usually last less than a year. Is it worth hiring one? Whats your take on this?","No, look on YouTube, there are many channels about dating. If you're willing to spend that much money and time on learning to date, you can spend some time watching YouTube videos.

To name a few:

* Matthew Hussey
* Tripp Advice
* Social Animal
* Courtney Ryan
* Marni your personal wing girl

dating,144me7c,1686261245.0,Love bombing or just a weird guy?,"So, eight years ago, I (F29) had a Tinder date with this guy (M30). Out of the blue, at the end of last year, he texted me. Unfortunately, I wasn't in town at the time, so I declined his offer for a date.

Now that I'm about to return to my hometown, I decided to text him and see if he's still interested in meeting up. He responded enthusiastically, immediately suggesting booking a table at a restaurant. Initially, I was impressed by his enthusiasm.

However, as our texting continued, he started showering me with compliments and even suggested booking a flight for me to where he is, with him paying for it. Suddenly, he began talking about how lucky he would be if our future kids had my characteristics. Right now he asked what kind of gut feeling I have about us ? - In just two days, he bombarded me with all of this.

Considering that I only went on one date with this guy eight years ago, it's challenging for me to comprehend his expectations of an ""us."" While he appears to be successful, with a good profession, a sporty and social lifestyle, and he's attractive in my opinion, his overly intense approach is making me uneasy.

First few dates should be a spot where you can actively talk to one another. Sitting in silence for two hours isn't a great way to get to know someone new."

it makes me feel like i am doing something wrong or he is repulsed by me. i am pretty new to dating and most of my dates have at least given me a peck on the cheek at the end. i just want to know if this is common or if i‚Äôm missing something.","I've never kissed a woman I've been on a date with, and not because I didn't want to, but because I am shy and anxious. If he's still planning dates with you, I'd bet maybe he's just shy. 

You have 2 options, make the move yourself (if he's like me, he will absolutely love that) or just bring it up on your next date. I've had girls straight up ask me why I haven't kissed them, I've had them tell me they wish I would kiss them. Sometimes it just about knowing it's wanted. Once I know a girl wants to kiss me, I'm easily able to make the move, but before that and I'm just in my head and too anxious to try. 

Not all guys are same, some are more shy and have a hard time making moves. But I'd bet my bottom dollar that 2 more dates lined up means he wants it just as bad."

So I would assume she would want to have sex often but that isn‚Äôt the case.

She says she‚Äôs not talking to anyone or fucking anyone else. (Neither am I) so im just wondering is it because she has a low sex drive or has to be emotionally be there to have sex?

Don‚Äôt give me a lecture, I know it‚Äôs not all about sex, the deep conversations, hanging out all the time and just talking is important as well.","Maybe you just don‚Äôt turn her on.

So why would I wait 8 dates to know if a guy wants to be exclusive. But than I dont want to come of a pushy or desperate. 
I am talking with a really nice guy, went on a date last night and we had such a great time. We have a second date planned for monday and we are both really looking forward to it. But I dont want to waste my time dating someone who isn‚Äôt looking for something long term, I dont want to be in a relationship like right now, I just want to know if he is open to see where things can go between us. How do you bring something like that up and is a second date too early? I see so many people wasting time or getting led on because of miscommunication and I dont want to get hurt in the end. Can I bring it up in a light way to ask if he is seeing other people or if he wants to see where things can go between us. He asked me last night if he can see me soon so I am not afraid of that.","Asking to be exclusive and asking what someone is looking for are two totally different conversations. It's pretty normal to ask very early on what the other is looking for, even on/before the first date. It's why some dating apps allow you to even list it on your profile."

Now i was stalking him online & found an inspirational talk he gave in his college. It was about how he lost his dad to an accident when he was 12 yo.
What should i do? I understand it's a deeply personal space for him. But is this a red flag? Or is it maybe him trying to not kill the fun vibe? Can someone help me understand this?

You recently met him.   I don‚Äôt tell anyone about losing my parents.  My partner and best friend know but I don‚Äôt talk about it freely .  It hurts to talk about.  I don‚Äôt want to talk about it with just anyone anywhere at anytime.  Have some empathy."

After our amazing first date (Friday), she said she wanted to go out again. We went out Saturday, and again SHE said she wanted to see me. 

Fast forward to last weekend, we went out to the movies. When I drove her back to her place, we talked in my car for about an hour before I finally made a move and kissed her. We started making out and it was incredibly passionate. She invited me upstairs where we made love. Not fucked, made love. The foreplay leading up was incredible, we were teasing and caressing each other. When we finally started having sex, it was magical. I can‚Äôt think of any better word to describe it. It was passionate and intense and we locked eyes and maintained eye contact several times. When we finished, we held each other for hours. Touching every inch of each others bodies and holding each other and kissing. She was telling me what she liked about me and her favorite features, and whispering the sweetest things to me. I left in the morning and came back later that night. It was the same thing all over again, we stayed up for hours having sex and talking. The next day we went on a 4hr 5mile hike, stopped at a diner on the way home, and again we had sex and talked and held each other until the sun came up. I had to go to work but she begged me to stay. 

I left a hoodie at her house and she‚Äôs sent me pictures this week of her wearing it, telling me she sleeps in it, tells me she misses me. She mentioned going to  upstate NY next weekend and when I sent her a couple of Airbnb listings, SHE went ahead and booked one for us! Which I wanted to pay her back but we agreed to just take another trip that I‚Äôll pay for!

We video chatted before yesterday for hours and she said she misses me and can‚Äôt wait to see me this weekend. She tells me she‚Äôs crazy about me and feels like we‚Äôve known each other forever. I‚Äôve never felt this strongly about anyone I‚Äôve known for only a couple of weeks! But she‚Äôs so sophisticated and beautiful and kindhearted. And she says all the rights things to make me feel great about myself. She even said she wants to be exclusive and doesn‚Äôt see the need for Bumble anymore.

But for whatever strange reason, she can be a pretty awful tester. We texted yesterday for a little bit in the morning and then I didn‚Äôt hear back from her till 10PM (12hrs later). She sent me a bunch of messages and photos of what she was doing but I was already asleep. 

I responded to her this morning and didn‚Äôt hear back from her till 130PM after I had double texted her asking if she was okay. She just said ‚Äúhey sorry yes I‚Äôm okay! I‚Äôll text you later‚Äù.

She works full time in the city and I know she‚Äôs studying for a certification, but is it possible that someone is THIS busy that they can‚Äôt find 5 seconds to just say ‚Äúhey I‚Äôm busy today, I‚Äôll text you tonight‚Äù? I don‚Äôt want to bring this up to her cause I am NOT gonna start nagging her not even two weeks into a relationship. This makes me feel as though she does not prioritize me or doesn‚Äôt respect me enough to give me the time of day. But at the same time, I feel as though maybe I‚Äôm over reacting because everything else is literally amazing and going great. 

Should I be worried or is she really this busy?","This is kind of backwards. The date is good, the sexual chemistry is good, she literally told you she liked you and stated reasons why, but you‚Äôre worried because she doesn‚Äôt text you back promptly? I would be worried if all those other things weren‚Äôt true. Don‚Äôt shoot yourself in the foot."
dating,144k34n,1686256024.0,"Second date seemed to go really well, then she said she wasn't interested in me romantically.","I may be reading things wrong, but this girl seemed really into me. She was super communicative, and was physically affectionate when we were together. She would stand super close to me on dates and make a lot of eye contact and she laughed at all my stupid jokes. She asked me out on the first and second date, and last night she invited me to her place to hang out. We ended up watching a movie, and she instantly cuddled right up next to me and with her head on my chest and had her legs right up against me and we were cuddling the entire time.

When it was time to leave, we hugged and she leaned in for a kiss, and we made out for a while. We were both into it, and I even tried pulling away bc I really needed to get home as it was getting late, and she wanted to keep going so we did for a bit. This morning I texted her saying it was really nice and invited for to my place this weekend, and I got hit with the ""I'm not romantically interested"".

While we were cuddling, I was rubbing her back and hair and hands. Do girls not like that? Was all this affection just a way of sizing me up and I was reading too much into it as genuine affection?","It‚Äôs hard to say, but from what it sounds like, she was testing the waters and was interested in seeing how good the physical chemistry was, that or she wasn‚Äôt super interested in you romantically somehow.

We‚Äôve been texting semi-casually until the opportunity came up for me to ask her out. We had been talking about good restaurants around town and when it seemed like we were both into the same one I told her we should go together and check it out.

It might for trauma, severe trauma or depression.  But what women think men need therapy for, often doesn't work for men. 

We can't just talk about something repetitively and hope for a solution.  Men and women's minds are wired very differently.  That technique works for women. It doesn't for men.

dating,144hzy5,1686251227.0,How do I know I'm ready to date again and how do I make sure it's healthy? My last relationships were unhealthy and I feel partially responsible. (Very long post. Marked NSFW for caution),"Guess I should do some basic info to start this off: I'm nearly 25 years old, female and I've been out of my last relationship for over a year now since this March. 

I've never really had a 'healthy' relationship, my last relationship lasted three years but it should have ended quite a while before then. It was only my second real relationship so it probably sounds a bit extra to speak of things like that, however I thought I knew what I was doing. 

&#x200B;

To sum these two relationships up that I've had: 

**Relationship 1 (19-20)**

When I was 19, I ended up with a weird 'situation' with a friend's ex. She knew about it, heck she kinda egged it on to begin with. They had dated for a very short time, he had stayed in the friend group and we all hung out one day for a game night. I had never thought of this guy romantically or sexually before this night, our friends made a crap ton of innuendo about us doing things though. We had already planned to watch anime together alone that night, and I guess the game night changed everything. He made a move on me, we messed about and for a week we were 'dating'. 

Should have stopped there, it didn't. He told me he wanted to break up, later that night he took my virginity. For about a year we kept fooling about, I was stupidly convinced he would lose interest if we didn't and he never turned me down. I was admittedly not completely sane during this time and though it was actually kinda mediocre by physical enjoyment standards, I needed the distraction and I liked when he cuddled me afterwards. One time he asked me to sleep over and I agreed, but I couldn't stay the whole night. I felt safe but I couldn't literally sleep in the same bed as someone else. 

**Relationship 2 (20-23)** 

I had no break from that relationship, I kinda moved right into this one with no issue because we weren't actually dating. I met a girl at our university club a while ago and thought 'hey she looks cool' but didn't think much of it until she joined our game nights. We didn't talk much until one day when I was feeling particularly giddy, we joked about and it turned into me being playful and touchy during that night's game. One thing lead to another, we started dating. 

She was a great girl but we were very much wrong for each other. I was a mentally unstable mess to an even worse degree than before, expected way too from her and we were both very dependant on each other. We didn't have sex as much as she wanted and initially I felt guilty because of how much I fooled around with my other ex. I kinda learnt the hard way though that I couldn't force myself to engage when I wasn't mentally feeling it. One thing never changed though, I still couldn't sleep in the same bed as her. I was not super fair to her and health issues eventually got to both of us. We tried to salvage it again and again, eventually we decided to break up. 

&#x200B;

**After the break-up and the actual advice asking part**

I've been single since and trying to get my life together. I had my university graduation around the time of that break up and whilst full-blown therapy hasn't been an option yet, I've been doing self-help courses and I'm on medication for my mental and physical health issues. So I feel a lot more independent and I don't so much as have a panic attack from waiting in a waiting room for a doctor's appointment anymore. I have a job that I hate only half the time, but I'm not completely financially independent because I can't afford to live on my own. I pay rent though, so I don't feel like a complete leech. 

For a while, I've been wanting to start dating again, but I'm always a bit worried. I get scared I'm going to end up in another unhealthy relationship, I worry I might meet someone who is nice and completely understanding and I won't be good enough for them. 

Truthfully, I don't know what a healthy relationship looks like. I have my ideas, but I thought that last relationship was healthy at the time and now I just wonder 'why did I ever let it go on that long'. 

I want to meet a nice guy or girl, and I want to treat them the way they deserve to be treated. I wanna be soft and sappy and be their princess whilst they're my king or queen. I wanna surprise them with little things like their favourite chocolate and have a cuddle from them when either of us is having a bad day. But physical affection doesn't bandage everything and as I learnt the hard way, my body doesn't mean shit. I can't keep a healthy relationship purely on fulfilling their physical needs and deluding myself thinking it's enough. On the other hand I still worry about *not* fulfilling those needs and disappointing them, but it's far too damaging to make myself do it. I guess I'll just have to hope they're patient and don't mind having to wait to mess about.

**How do I know if I'm ready to date again, and how do I make sure I don't make any mistakes and fall into something that's going to hurt me or someone else?**

&#x200B;

*Kinda sorry for how long a post this is, but I wanted to explain as much as possible about why I'm hesitant to date again and why I feel my love life has been a dumpster fire so far. I've had mixed feelings about those past relationships but ultimately they were two-way streets, I'm accountable to some degree for hurting myself.*",

I think the first thing you can do is to be concious of this and to know that everybody don‚Äôt feel the same way as you.

I think people like us that have attachment issues have had heavy feelings of loneliness and when a person appears in our life we attach to them very heavy. That can be a red flag for some people, but don‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs bad, its a way of feeling love and attachement and you‚Äôll have to work this to not cross other people limits.

Try some introspection on why you think this happen to you, maybe you think the key to happiness is to find a partner? Maybe you feel stagnant and this makes you feel something? 

I don‚Äôt know what is it for you but as more you know why you feel that way, the more you‚Äôll know how to deal with it.

A short term solution would be when u feel you‚Äôre being too much go to walk or do something you like, play some games, hang out with friends, do sport‚Ä¶

dating,144gkqd,1686247916.0,Girl playing games?,"Hello guys!

There's a girl in my class in college, and we've been texting for a while. Initially, she responded to all my texts quickly, then started delaying response time when I subtly began to make my intentions known (just a little bit of flirting here and there, which she seemed to like and find funny).At certain times, she texts/calls me if she doesn't hear from me. 

All of a sudden, she started becoming distant, even replying my messages after a day. It went on for a while and since I hate playing games, I forgot about her and stopped texting and she did same.

She started calling and texting me last week. I pick her calls - which she says is just to check up on me - but scarcely respond to her text and even if I respond, she takes too long to reply. 

She continuously initiates  texts with me, but doesn't reply till the next day, and her response is usually just a word or two.

My question is:
What do you think her motive is?
How should I approach this situation?

I don't want to taint any relationship we have since we're classmates and still have a few months before graduation. 


Ps. I know she's not busy, because she told me she has nothing to do at home (We have a 2-week break).","Don‚Äôt know what her motives are, guessing games aren‚Äôt really useful.

dating,144fnkd,1686245809.0,Has she (19F) lost interest in me (19M),"Hey everyone,  

So this girl and I (19M) met through college last year, being in the same class for a few subjects. We hit it off as study buddies at first, but gradually started hanging out more often from December last year. Anyhow, we went on multiple hang outs such as ice skating, grabbing lunch, playing golf and tennis etc (touch barrier was broken through holding hands and hugging). After these hang outs, I started to fall for her personality, resulting in me wanting to ask her out on a date.  

I asked her last week in person when we met up to study, but wimped out from directly stating the word 'date' and ended up just saying something like, ""Do you want to do ___ on a Friday after our finals.""  
She responded with a yes, but also stated how we will plan a proper date sometime soon after the exams. To note, her final exams are two weeks after mine, and both her and I massively prioritise our studies over anything else. Anyways, I wanted to clarify that this will be a date and not a hang out so I shot her a text that night to make sure we were both on the same page. However, this is where I'm a little confused as she has left me on delivered and has not responded since (it's now been a week).  
In my past dating experiences I would immediately take this as a rejection, but considering the fact that she genuinely has a very busy scheduled lifestyle and its the final exam period, maybe she will respond once hers is over? At the same time though, I'm sure nobody is that busy. Should I just wait if she responds, and just move on if she doesn't?  

tl:dr, Met a girl through college last year, went on multiple hangouts and asked her out on a date but got left on delivered",
dating,144flv1,1686245700.0,Im nervous about dating again,"Hello. I don‚Äôt know if this is the right place to ask for advice. But I see others have their own issues so I hope this post will be ok.

I‚Äôm wanting to date again but there‚Äôs things holding me back. Firstly, my past. The last two women I was with just completely ruined my life. One cheated and the other made me homeless just to be with someone else she liked. I was so low I ended up on anti depressants and I‚Äôve been diagnosed with PTSD and social anxiety disorder which my GP thinks is linked to it all.

I hate it because it makes me feel like I‚Äôm not normal and less of a man if that makes sense? The worst thing was I put everything into both of those relationships, which to me is the right thing to do, there‚Äôs no point being in a relationship if your not 100% committed. After it all I just got walked over and even today I can‚Äôt think of what I did wrong? I was considerate, always there when needed, supportive, all the things a man should be and what a woman deserves. It put me in the wrong frame of mind in many ways which I won‚Äôt bore you with, but one was thinking every woman is the same (I know they are not) and ‚Äúlove‚Äù simply didn‚Äôt exist anymore. Honestly I still have the same thoughts about love as I haven‚Äôt been proven wrong.

The other thing holding me back is my social anxiety. I never use to but now I find it difficult to be around people I don‚Äôt know. Just talking to someone I‚Äôm finding it difficult to even find something to talk about and I find it seriously frustrating. Others think I‚Äôm being rude or not talkative but that‚Äôs completely not true. And I can‚Äôt explain because no women would want to listen and I doubt some would even try to understand.

I don‚Äôt know what to do. I have a councillor and I even find it difficult to talk to her. I‚Äôm 40 years old and been single for nearly two years, I feel like my life is wasting away and all I want to do is simply settle down with someone and be happy. It‚Äôs not much to ask but it‚Äôs damn near impossible to get. My councillor claims some people don‚Äôt ever get over their anxiety, if I‚Äôm now stuck like this I doubt I‚Äôll ever find anyone, and the thought of going through life alone, honestly it‚Äôs not nice.

Honestly, would you say I should just give up hope? Because from where I sit I can‚Äôt see a way forward with it. It‚Äôs always the nice ones in life that get shat on simply for being a good person.

She out of nowhere deleted her dating apps infront of me and I did the same, and its been really good since. We've been seeing eachother frequently and are closing to become bf and gf I'd say

But today I redownloaded Tinder to show my friend who has just gotten into dating apps my profile as hes struggling with getting matches, and knows I actually met M off of Tinder. I then saw that M has updated her pictures including ones she took literally last weekend

I texted her saying i didnt know you were back on tinder and she was very apologetic saying how she installed it again because she was bored and how much she misses me and she wants to be exclusive. im just a bit confused on what to think, i really hate staying mad and holding grudges on people but i just dont understand why you would reinstall it, AND update your pictures when you wanted to be exclusive?

if anyone has any input or similar story please let me know, thanks",Did she delete the app after u confronted her about it tho? Cuz that‚Äôs a red flag boi üö©üö© as a girl I can confirm she‚Äôs trying to have ‚Äúoptions‚Äù especially bec it‚Äôs a situationship and SHE deleted her apps in front of u FIRST then SHE downloads it again saying she was ‚Äúbored‚Äù.

dating,144f6p9,1686244718.0,"I screwed up by being too pushy to get together, but maybe it's for the best?","# Meeting and first dates

I (29m) met a woman (26f) on OkCupid. She's really pretty, and she makes these amazing cosplays. While I don't really have the time nor skills to make my own cosplays, I've always greatly admired them.

I'm definitely an activity-oriented person, and I love doing stuff like board games, amusement parks, and other fun things (well, I think they're fun, at least). So, for dates, I always try to plan an activity, so that if it doesn't work out, at least I had fun with the activity, and it doesn't feel like a wasted night.

For our first date, we went to a brewery where we had drinks, ate pizza, and played board games. The next week, she was too busy to hang out in-person, so we had a video chat. For our second date, we went to a small amusement park where we played mini-golf, did bumper boats, and ate ice cream, before going back to my place where we ate takeout and played her favorite video game that many of her cosplays are based on.

While I really struggle reading people, she seemed into me, and it seemed like she wanted to get together again.

# Planning the third date

She was busy the next week, but we made plans to hang out the Friday after that (two weeks from our second date) when we were both off from work. I was going to cook her dinner, and we would play more her favorite video game. The only snag was that she didn't yet know what time she was coming. As a meticulous planner, this really bothered me, but I decided to let it go, since at least I knew the day she was coming.

It wasn't until the day before (Thursday) that she told me she was driving her dad to the doctor at about 3:30p, and she wouldn't be available until that was done. While I was disappointed that she wouldn't be coming until late (I thought we would spend the whole day together), I am family-oriented, and I know the importance of helping family, so I told her I totally understood.

When Friday came, the forecast said there was going to be thunderstorms, so she said she didn't feel comfortable driving to me. I was really disappointed, but she said we could still video chat. So, I put the chicken I had defrosted for her into the fridge, and we hopped on a video call.

She was working the next day (Saturday) until about noon, and then on Sunday she was going to an art museum with her friends. I asked if she wanted to come over after work on Saturday, where I could cook her that meal I had promised, and she said she would see if she was too tired or not.

When I reached out to her the next day, she said she was too tired to come over. I expressed sympathy, but I really wanted to see her, so I asked what time she was coming back from the museum the next day.

And I never heard from her again.

# Thoughts and reflection

I reached out late on Wednesday to say ""Hi"", but she never got back to me. It looks like I was being too pushy about hanging out, and I scared her off. But, maybe this is for the best? I am a meticulous planner, and while I'm definitely an introvert, I like to go out and do fun things with people. While I enjoy the planning process, and I'm totally fine doing all of the planning myself, all I ask in return is that I get a date and time when they are available, and she couldn't even do that.

Maybe I'm just crazy, and people are never going to be willing to make plans. Maybe I'm right, and asking for a date and time to hang out is reasonable. Maybe getting together in-person at least once every two weeks is unreasonable, especially when you've only gone on two in-person dates? What does everyone think? Should I just lower my expectations of planning (especially that early in a relationship), or should I try to find someone who can make that kind of commitment? Is there something I need to work on about myself?

**Note**: This is an edited version of the original I wrote that was around 1,300+ words long (this is about 700 words long). I tried to cut it down so it is not too long while still explaining the important points, but if anyone thinks I should post the long version, please let me know!","Hmm idk, I like planning things too. I think u r fine, she just wasn‚Äôt interested.

I get tired easily but every weekend I would spend a day with the guy I‚Äôm dating and even drive all the way to him if he was really busy. If u like a person you‚Äôll make time for them.

I would say that u don‚Äôt need to go all out on the first couple dates. Play it by the mood. My ex and I had our first date planned to be ice cream but we ended up having lunch and I got home at 10 pm. After that we would spend 2 pm - 12 am on date days. Other guys wouldn‚Äôt give me that much time or I wouldn‚Äôt give them that much time. It‚Äôs all abt mutual interest."

dating,144etqv,1686243883.0,Question: does anyone have experience in previous relationships being paranoid of their SO cheating; that was never proven and wasn't/ isn't a problem and their current relationship?,"I'm writing this because I used to be very suspicious in my last relationship, and ones before it. Because of this: I thought it was just *me*. Something I couldn't change or needed to fight in order to have a good relationship. 

Recently, however, I realized I don't feel this way with my current SO; and it required no effort to achieve. 

I just trust rhem and feel satisfied with our relationship in ways I didn't know possible. 

I was thinking about this: and came to the realization that I was maybe disassociating my previous partners behavior from them. Sort of like: I lived them, but they said and did some mean things: and because they were unreceptive to communication: then I built up this false belief that they just lived someone else instead of confronting the issue: a lack of communication. 

Has anyone else had a similar turn of events?

In my opinion, sex is a choice that is made together when both feel comfortable. 

It‚Äôs totally fine for you to want to wait, but you should also recognize your dating pool will shrink significantly. Sex is important in a romantic relationship. It‚Äôs the equivalent of having sex but holding off on going on any real dates for 3 months. If you flip it, it sounds strange. 

Perhaps you could rephrase it and tell the people you‚Äôre dating that you need to move slowly. You could be even clearer and say that you‚Äôd like to be the one to initiate sex for the first time‚Ä¶ or that you‚Äôd like to give verbal consent when you‚Äôre ready.

dating,144e3eo,1686242227.0,The dating proces has made me stop believing in love...,"I don't think I believe in love. And at most I believe it exists for others, but not for me. It's not that I don't want to believe in love, it's just that all previous experiences for me have been very disappointing. 

Every time I allow myself to start believing it might be possible when it is going well with a guy, it turns to shit. I know dating is about finding the right person at the right time and so many things have to align for it to work. But at the same time, it seems to align pretty easily for others. 

I do tend to be a true romantic at heart which doesn't really help with the disappointment as it hits even harder. I really want to find love. But maybe it doesn't exist and I am just setting myself up for failure? When I say I don't believe in love, I also know it's a lot of fear talking. I don't know when I became such a cynic, but I am. I feel like such a bitter person sometimes and I wish I wasn't, but it's like I can't help it. 

Nobody has ever loved me or given me a chance. And to make matters worse. There was never a reason. I even got, I really like you and I felt something, but then it all went to shit and they started ignoring me. So yeah.... trust shattered. I guess I wonder how other people keep believing in it? Maybe because you felt loved before so you know it exists? I have never felt that. Nobody has ever told me they loved me and maybe nobody will ever say that to me.

When I first got on it was discouraging that no one matched with me. I‚Äôd go weeks and weeks without a right swipe and I lived (and currently live) in a college town. To be fair I wasn‚Äôt in the best of shape back then.

I took a break pretty much from when I turned 19 to now. I had spent a couple years working manual labor (warehouses) and I was feeling super confident about where my body was when I started getting matches. Nothing crazy. Maybe 2 since last week but that‚Äôs 2 more than I ever got 4 years ago. 

The first one was Tinder. We talked for like an hour on the app and it seemed like we were looking for the same thing, an NSA hookup. Then she added me on snap and halfway to her place (a 30 minute drive) all of the sudden she wants $80 for an hour. And I‚Äôm willing to admit, while it isn‚Äôt something I‚Äôd usually do I sent her the first $40. I pull up to her place and then she sends me a snap telling me to ‚Äútalk to her manager‚Äù so I added her. The manager then tells me she needs a $500 security fee. Needless to say I left. Other than this I‚Äôve had 0 likes on tinder. 

After that I downloaded Adult Friend Finder because I‚Äôd heard it was good for the kind of relationship I‚Äôm looking for rn. Chatted with a girl I met on there on Instagram and after making plans to meet up she told me I‚Äôd need to get some ‚Äúsafety merit badge‚Äù. I looked at the link she sent me and it looks like a scam. I mean they‚Äôll photoshop your face and birthday onto a card and make outrageous claims like you‚Äôre HIV negative with no more info than your name and cell phone. I told her I‚Äôd pay for a real background check if safety was her concern and she got mad, claimed I was a sex offender, and told me no one would meet up with me without this specific badge from the site she sent me. When I said no she told me she‚Äôd ‚Äúcontact the admin‚Äù. So I blocked her.

I am a M/ 26 years old. I recently started dating a new lady a few weeks ago. It was really unexpected and strange it felt like fireworks I thought we had dynamic chemistry.

We had been on about 3 dates but in between those dates we would switch off and stay at one another‚Äôs house on the weekends, and we hooked up quite a bit.

She even took imitative and planned on of the dates.This lady even already gave me a nickname, introduced me to all of her coworkers, and the first night we met told me that she could see her self marrying me.

On my side, I had mentioned to her that I do see potential in the relationship. And I would 100% would want to ask her to be my girlfriends if things continued going as well as they were.

This lady is a medical tech and works night shifts. She had to work 3 days in a row so I hadn‚Äôt heard much from her. I did not think much about it since I understand that grind and I‚Äôm not much of a text person myself. Anyways yesterday after knowing my grandfather died the day before she decides to tell me that she is overwhelmed and that this was all too much for her.

I responded with the typical no worries. And she said she would reach out to me next week to talk.

My question is for all of you with the context should I just cut this girl off? Or should I maybe wait to see if she reaches out and take things from there? ( if she even reaches out this seems like she was letting me down nicely)",

dating,144bbcw,1686235782.0,please share advice and thoughts on casually dating multiple people.,"I have decided I want to make an effort at mindfully dating around and not jumping into anything serious.  

I have been in several multi-year relationships and just want to try and be more sure about the next relationship before investing into that with someone. 

The primary reasons is that I really want to find a life-partner and a relationship that lasts.  And I don't want to waste my time time or that of other's on anything that doesn't have real potential to last more than 2-3 years.  

I know this is not necessarily ever known for sure, but in past relationships I know I at least was less sure than I could have been and I now know much better what I am looking for and how I can be a better partner.  

Anyways, since this is sort of new to me I am asking for advice and thoughts.  

My primary concerns are keeping things casual while also testing compatability and getting to know someone.  I know communication and being on the same page is key.  

But also, the more time you spend with someone the more intimate things naturally likely become - how to continue seeing that person if you are still not ready for a serious commitment. 

At some point I suppose you must make that judgement that if you are still unsure that it may likely not be a good match. But there is one person for example who has been on the same page but things start to feel more intimate than the casual dating label might suggest.  

Idk exactly what I""m asking but hope I've described my thoughts and concerns well.  Appreciate your input.","Set very, very clear boundaries and make sure to communicate your intentions. If you‚Äôre confused, ask questions because assumptions, second-guessing and ‚Äúreading people‚Äù won‚Äôt give you answers. It‚Äôll give you false hope and unwarranted expectations."

I'm a 26-year-old guy who recently had a fantastic Tinder date with a 23-year-old girl last Monday. We matched on the app and spent about a month chatting before deciding to meet in person.

I had an amazing time during the date. We enjoyed some drinks and food together, and as I live in a different town, we walked back to the train station when it was time to say goodbye.

We shared a goodbye kiss, and I mentioned that we should definitely plan to do this again sometime.

However, since then, I haven't received any response from her. The last message I sent was on Monday, just to let her know that I arrived home safely and wished her the same.

I'm feeling a bit uncertain about where things stand. Could it be that she's just busy or not interested anymore? I'd appreciate some advice on how to proceed. Should I wait a bit longer or reach out again to see if she's still interested?

TLDR; I want to break up with my girlfriend but we are going on vacation with her family this weekend and I feel stuck.","It's gonna suck anytime. But perhaps there is a way you can get out of going on the vacation yourself - like sudden ""gastro"" or a work thing or a 'family member X really needs you to help with this thing that came up' - and breaking up once it's over. So then you have some distance from her, while allowing her to enjoy her vacation. I'm sure that's a bit of a grey area ethically, but it might be a compromise.

Otherwise, break up now. It sounds like you're fit to burst and you're gonna end up blurting it out ON the vacation. And that's gonna be unforgettable."

dating,144ab5h,1686233327.0,Change approach to dating/relationships?,"Currently in college 21M and went on about 7 dates total this year half from hinge/half from school.  I feel like learned so much along the way about myself, what I'm looking for so regardless of what's happened i've improved a lot. 

With that being said there's a bit of a trend here with girls and rejection. But I figured I could ask here and maybe get some help! 

One thing I wanted to ask here is about potentially changing my overall approach:

I have a bit more of an eccentric happy go personality. The problem I'm thinking that's occurring is that most of the girls i'm seeing see this as  sweet gay male friend which isn't exactly what they want. I am bi so sometimes I can give off not fully straight energy which might be off putting to the general female population.

I do still make very intentional attempts to show I'm interested through flirting physically and with words too but it might be too much? 

Is this a case of keep being who you are and someone good will come eventually or do I make efforts to just tone it down a bit, establish that I'm not uninterested/gay friend e.g through kissing, sex etc. then open up a bit more as we go so as to not confuse them at the beginning?

hopefully that makes sense thanks for the help","Keeping your mouth shut is a sure way to attract girls, seriously. Be good at conversations but keep your mouth shut. I used to speak a lot when in college and than shit things happen last few yrs and I stop talking a lot lol, turns out in my favor. Girls just dig it. 
When you are with a girl, joke about sex, their sexuality, how they have fun, don‚Äôt talk about other bois you will definitely be a gay lol, touch, I have a habit of going straight for thighs haha. And looking at the boobs, they know, they notice and they will joke on your face.

dating,144a77y,1686233068.0,"Men, do you ever regret losing someone who was good to you?","I recently have been reflecting back on a past relationship and wondering if they regret taking me for granted. I know I was really caring and supportive towards him. He would randomly tell me how my love was felt everyday. However, he had attachment issues and tended to self sabotage the relationship. A few days ago, a friend of mine was venting to me about how he screwed up with someone he liked and how he realized when she was gone, how much of a supportive person she was. And I guess I just want to know if this is a common thing? Or if anyone else has a similar story. We‚Äôre you just not ready for a good woman at the time? And what exactly made you regret it?

EDIT: This question is meant for men who have considered to have had a good woman in their life. Not to bash women or a woman because you‚Äôve only had bad experiences.","My ex and I split up because we were different people. He wanted polyamory, I didn't, and it broke us up. A few years later, when I was willing to try friendship and we'd healed, he mentioned that the first few months, he felt like he was drowning trying to re adjust his entire life. He didn't realize how many small things I did that made his day run more smoothly or the ways he relied on me that I never made a big deal out of. 




My great grandmother called the way I love ""Fairy Love"". When you take the time to know your partner in little ways and try to improve little things. 





My current fiance notices and appreciates the things I do. I wake up early even though I could sleep in to braid his hair, I make his coffee some mornings, if there's a towel in the dryer I'll run it so that he can have the warmest towel or warm blankets before bed occasionally and where my other partner would never notice I watch my fiance melt when I do these things for him. In the end hon, it doesn't matter if they miss it. What matters is that they didn't appreciate it when you were doing it for them. Find someone who does."
dating,144a1sj,1686232735.0,It feels like my bf avoids me,"I (14f) my bf (soon 14m) have been dating for 2 months but it feels like he has already lost feelings for me. He‚Äôs really sweet and caring when we are alone, he hugs me and kisses me when we‚Äôre alone. But when there‚Äôs other people he doesn‚Äôt even hug me, especially in school. It feels like he tries to avoid me in school and he doesn‚Äôt even try to talk to me. He‚Äôs like a different person almost. 

My class was on a field trip yesterday. We did different activities, but every time I tried to go up to my boyfriend to talk to him he always does something else. So lunch rolls around and we are eating. I finally have the chance to talk to him and we only talk for 10 min. So i says: I‚Äôve been wanting to talk to you all day, but every time I go to talk to you, you‚Äôre doing something else. And he replies with: I was absolutely not gonna go do that. I‚Äôm feeling kinda hurt but I tell him: You can go do what you want. So he nods his head and leaves.

Today we had another field trip but different, my class and his class weren‚Äôt interacting at all. But I saw him at the end and we were gonna hang out today, but he left me for his guy friends.

At this point I would just let it go and put it out of my mind if I were you. Think of all the reasons to do so:

1. He's leaving in 3 weeks anyway and there's no future to this situationship. It sounds like he's already pulling away and holding onto this will only erode your self esteem. I've been there.

2. In your other post it seems like he was talking about you with his friends in their language? And was upset with you after? Insisting that you stay over and sleeping with you but everything was ""off"", most likely he just wanted to hook up one last time and leave it at that.

3. There's no rule of thumb to an ""acceptable way"" to end a relationship or situationship. People do what they want, and sometimes it's shitty. If he's leaving for good then it's likely easier for him to just not follow up with any contact at all.

So yeah, try to occupy yourself in the next while and do your best to just forget about this dude, whether he reaches out or not should no longer be your concern at this point and should be of no consequence to you whatsoever. Hope this makes sense!"

For more context, I just moved back to the city I call home, which is one of the largest metropolitan areas in the country, if not the biggest after being abroad for awhile and was very eager to get out there. In my first week I was seeing a lot of success, but then got the call about my dad.

On top of that, I decided to mostly give up drinking as my father was an alcoholic and I have had some issues with binge drinking, so it felt right.

dating,1448fq7,1686228663.0,I feel confused about what the hell is happening or what this guy even wants from me.,"So I've been training at the same gym for over 1.5 years. This guy who I thought had no interest in me recently approached me and is obviously try to chat me up and it turns out he is moving in a few weeks. He seemed fun and flirty and I am looking to dip my toe into dating. He'd always come hang out in groups when he finds out I am there in the past month. 

The sexual tension you could cut with a knife, one of his friends kept joking that maybe we can fall in love so that he can stay in town. He came to this giant dinner unexpectedly and told me he wanted to spend more time with me. He stayed by me all night and we talked. He offered to drive me alone to the second location. There would be little accidental grazes and we would have some really good conversations in the car. I thought maybe he wanted to hook up.

But then when he drove me home, we got into this deep conversation that lasted over an hour. He was like in near tears talking about how he rarely finds a spark in women that he likes and he sees this spark in me. I was put off by it because I thought he was idealizing me and I told him you really don't know me. We end the night where he got out of the car to give me an awkward hug, I thought he was going to make a move but didn't. I was going to make the move but the hug was so quick.

Then before he leaves he says he wants to see me before he leaves but then starts to slow ghost me. Kept giving vague answers about when this hang out would be. My other friends think he accidentally caught feelings and felt awkward about the car talk. I wanted to make him feel less awkward so I did text him saying that I may have not reacted in the best way to him opening up and it's been hard for me to open up to people I don't know well. He really appreciated how honest I am and liked spending time with me.

Then recently he started texting me normal conversation stuff to tell me about his move but suddenly it just stops mid convo completely after asking me a question about my life. I am so confused on what he even wants from me. Was he after a hookup? I kind of resent that he just dropped into my life before he left and now does not even seem to want to be friends. Like what was even the point of all that? We all belong to a group at the gym. None of the guys know what happened and think we had a thing but like nothing happened at all.","Sounds like a guy who....

\- Has no game  
\- Has got a few personal issues  
\- Lacks confidence

....and when he made a tit of himself in-front of you, he was suffering from embarrassment (hence the slow ghosting). 

So yeah, just sounds like a really socially awkward guy. You get them sometimes. 

If he's moving town anyway, you could just let it be and forget the whole thing even happened. Because I'm pretty sure that if you began dating him, it wouldn't be long before you stopped feeling attracted to him."

dating,1447ms8,1686226499.0,"""I'm not ready for a relationship right now""","I (M) talked to this girl on Hinge for about a week and met up a couple days ago. Conversation was great, she was super cute, I got her number and we moved off-app pretty quickly, and she confirmed with me before the date that we were both looking for the same thing: a long-term relationship.

&#x200B;

The date was amazing. One of the best I've ever been on. We talked about so many things and the vibe the whole time was really fun and flirty. We were making plans to meet up later in the week and everything seemed to be going really well. She seemed like a really honest and genuine person and we talked about a lot of things that I wouldn't expect to talk about on the first date. We got dinner, walked around the town, made out on a bench. I walked her back to her car with plans to meet up at her place the next day. She texted me when she got home and thanked me for a great night.

&#x200B;

She texted me good morning the next day. Things were continuing much as they had before the date. She said she had a headache after work and wanted to take a nap, and I had no reason not to believe her. She texted me a few hours later saying she was feeling better, so I asked what her plans were for the evening, expecting her to invite me over. Instead, she said she had a great time last night but realized she isn't looking to date. She assured me it's not me, she just isn't ready for a relationship right now.

&#x200B;

I was really blindsided by this and I've been hurt and confused since she told me. I haven't gotten this many green flags from a date in a long time, and we had great chemistry in person. I just can't wrap my head around it. I know she either isn't into me, which doesn't make sense to me given the vibe on the date, or she's seeing someone else and didn't want to tell me, which could make sense. Or she's telling the truth. Maybe she's just scared of commitment.

&#x200B;

I know there's nothing I could have done to change her mind, and I don't think there's anything I would have done differently. It's just really frustrating and confusing to have that kind of chemistry in person and get nothing but green flags for the whole night into most of the next day only for her to change her mind. I know it was literally one date, but I hadn't felt this way about anyone in a long time. I guess I appreciate her letting me know instead of ghosting me. I'm going to take a break from dating for awhile, and I'm sure I'll feel better given a bit of time, but this whole situation is really frustrating and confusing. I wish her all the best and I hope she finds happiness in whatever way she needs, but I really thought we could have had that together. It feels like I'm setting myself up for failure when I get excited about dates at all anymore, because there's a chance of something like this happening. It just sucks man",When a girl says they‚Äôre not ready for a relationship it usually means they‚Äôre not ready for a relationship‚Ä¶ WITH YOU.  Just their way of letting you down easy.
dating,1447iim,1686226156.0,Confession,"I want apologize first off to my superwoman and kids and then to everyone who I mislead including myself. This comes from the heart, so my words are real. Im glad none of you took me serious enough to actually meet cause you would have meet someone else that would have been bad. Im not a bad person but a person put in a heartbroken situation and feeling like the only way I could get the pain off me was to hand it to someone else. So when my family left me I went into a rage. But two days ago I found out some thing's that tortured my soul. But I didn't react negatively, I reacted with a smile and positive words. The mother of my kids really hates me. And after looking at it can't blame her. Although I never cheated on her I did something worse. I missed the birth of my daughter because I was to afraid to stand up for myself and walk away so I played into the game and lost. Now here I was again. Without the only woman in the world who gave me peace. I can't do it again. I won't do it again. I won't continue to live a lie like im not hurt, or miss her, or wish that I could somehow repair and get back everything I lost but I can't. But i felt I needed to release this balled up energy of pain that I've been giving a lot of people because of the action I've made.. No one deserves that. Losing someone you love more than anything in the world is a different feeling than losing a friend. I lost that and that pain and torture became my temple. Although I won't say things to incriminate myself just know that if I didn't have it and they, ya was was a target because nothing was more important than them having it and me seeing a smile on they face. I haven't been sexually active since September of 2021. I wish she just  knew how much I miss them and how my world was rocked. But today is my first step. Being honest ...baby mama if your out there , I promise to love, protect, nurture, and provide with every ounce of me. I've made mistakes and I manned up to them. But on my kids I've never cheated on you, will never cheat and never thought about cheating. After seeing the things I saw and hearing your words to me and seeing the prayer that my baby constantly sends to God I know I must change. She's the mother of children the queen of my empire. God I am sorry for the lies and pain I caused people because of my pain. I can't deceive another person, I won't deceive another person. Im created for one person and you've shown me who that was long ago, just being without my right hand made me go into a great depression and didn't care who was hurt as long as they got it when they needed it.  You know my heart lord and I know this is why my faith and prayers and manifestations wasn't coming to life. Im leaving all social media knowingly and unknowingly. My focus is back on being the greatest father ever, the male I could be and hopefully winning spouse comeback of the year lol.. you said all things are possible if we trust in you wholeheartedly. This was my first step to showing that im committed to to getting them back regardless. This is the real me no hidden cameras no hidden faces no nothing. Just the real me from here on out. I know im going to be tested but I will prove to them all that nothing in this world means more to me then to be back in the presence of my superwoman and kids. I just wish one day she would text and say hello. Just to let me know that someone is in my corner even if it's a silent corner. Thank you guys for listening and again I do apologize. Signing out..

Yesterday on my continued journey I stopped and picked up my lab work after taking my girls to see if they needed up to date shots and things. Lab work and hair follicle drug test results came in. Well I passed both. So now this is my new confession, I still can't for the love of me comb my daughters hair and I can't get my baby to stop asking God this same one prayer she wants.

I(28m)‚Äôve been on two dates with a girl(25f). First date went well, we had great chat and we kissed. Second date was even better, spent 3.5 hours in a bar(went to get a bit of food in between), we made out like 10 times passionately, we held hands, bantered and laughed a lot. I walked her to the bus stop and we kissed a few times before her bus arrived. She comes to my city for work 2 days-ish a week but she‚Äôll move here fully soon.

After the date I texted her 2 hours later asked if she got home ok and she said she did. We haven‚Äôt had sex yet.

* about our communication

She has never initiated any text convo unless it‚Äôs date related.

There were 14 days between our first date and our second date, we only texted a few times all related to the second date I initiated, she gladly said yes and told me when she‚Äôs free. We had very handful small talk in between.

We are not texting regularly. It seems like she‚Äôs not always on social media as she doesn‚Äôt have many pictures on Instagram and doesn‚Äôt post story.

The question is:

After I said ‚ÄòI had a great time yesterday, let‚Äôs do this again‚Äô, she tapped likes on the message and didn‚Äôt reply, which was on yesterday morning.

What should I do? Shall I ask her out again soon? I‚Äôm feeling a bit like our effort is imbalanced. Briefly mentioned making her food and cocktail so I might consider asking her coming over as well. She is enthusiastic when we meet though. She doesn't initiate physical touch, which I do all the time.

PS. Not sure if this matters, she‚Äôs a local in this country and I‚Äôm an expat, English is her first language and it‚Äôs not for me.",Be patient..

Make sure your bathroom is the cleanest part of your home! Women usually always will go to your bathroom and spend time in there. Condoms should be handy. Make sure home isn‚Äôt smelly.

Usually hookups will start very slow. Atleast for me then it escalates naturally. Play a movie or something

Edit: also keep XXL shirts and extra toothbrushes handy just incase she crashes at your place"

dating,1444h7w,1686216709.0,if an ex ask for fwb are they just desperate and don't have options?,"So not too long ago I broke up with my ex but she ask if i was ok with fwb. I was actually surprised she asked because since i broke up with her i thought she would never thought of having sex with me. I told one of my friends this and he told me in his opinion it seems like my ex is just desperate and have no options because if she did have options why would she ask for fwb. I never really thought about this but is this usually the case?

the only reason i can see an ex asking for fwb is either:

\- desperate and don't have options, still have feelings for the other person, or the sex was just that good

For those that have been offered or asked to do fwb what was the reason for it?","I don't think it means she has no options. Of course she can have sex with other guys. But as a woman it's highly unlikely to get good or even ok sex with a stranger so if sex with you was good or ok and in additionshe knows you and can trust you, it makes sense to chose you."

Although we aren't dating I think down the line there is a possibility that we will end up dating. With this in mind should i bother with online dating?

edit: So i did use online dating before. I had decent success with online dating as that is how I met my ex. Got an ok amount of dates with different girls from the short time i used it. It's just that i found online dating pretty time consuming and meeting new people was draining. I've also noticed that it's a lot harder to find compatible people from online dating. For example with my ex she was a sweet girl it was just that i found out we were so different, her values were really different from mine, her sense of humor was different from mien so in the end i had to break up with her since i didn't see us going long term

This is actually why i want to date my best friend. I've notice when ur friends with someone u are friends with them because u share similar values and sense of humor",Don't put your eggs in one basket. Date around.

He went home and things were different. He started to ignore my texts and after 2 weeks we meet up again. He said ""I ignore you, because you blame me for meeting other women. I know you never trusted me, and that's okay. Maybe we should stop with our relationship, because you stress me out"".

My boyfriend explicitly said he was going to Fck the person raw and pump his load in the person. 

The only message after that was the person saying ‚ÄúI take it you didn‚Äôt enjoy that as much as I did‚Äù. I gather that is because nothing was said after the meet and the number is now blocked.

dating,1441llc,1686206401.0,Still reeling from his ex üôÅ,"
Hi everyone. I need advice. 

I have been friends with a guy for a while through both of our daughters been best friends since kindergarten. They are now in fourth grade about to be in fifth. When I first met me, no boyfriend, he was from what I thought, happily married to his wife, and his daughter, who it happens to be my daughters, best friend.
Going over there to drop off my daughter and get to know them, I came to find out that his wife was having an affair with a guy, and actually bring him over to the house, while the play dates were happening and the husband would leave knowing this. I was mind blowing. I couldn‚Äôt understand why he wouldn‚Äôt stand up and at least all them to do their shenanigans outside of his own home. Moving forward, she ends up, marrying the guy and moving on with her life. I got out of a toxic relationship and wanted to be single for a while. All the while, for about a year to my nail boyfriend was pursuing me very hard. I decided finally to give him being that I knew he was a good dad, a good guy, a good career and house, and was tired of toxic men so I gave it a go. In the beginning, he would take me shopping, etc. etc. to try to impress me. All the while, as I was trying to get to know him. Overtime, I realize that most conversations would lead to his ex wife. It seem like he would start taking me or was taking me to the places they had been together. We talked about moving on in the future, but he still wants to remain in the same house him and his wife purchase together. I feel like that house has lots of that energy being that she cheated on him in that home as well. I want to start fresh with someone and my dream is to buy a home with my future person. He was talking me into, perhaps building onto the house for my children so that we could all fit together but still, he won‚Äôt let go of it. Here‚Äôs a catch, when they first broke up three years ago, they would exchange the children every Wednesday and have dinner together as a temporary thing for the kids to get on with the divorce. It‚Äôs been three of us for years now, and they are still meeting every Wednesday for dinner. Most of the time they meet for dinner and have a glass or bottle of wine or two and talk about more than just the kids. It ends up becoming a two or three hour session. He‚Äôs inviting me to it to prove to me that nothing was going on, but the whole time he was just talking to his wife about their kids, ignoring her husband, and I, or her husband was making comments about finally getting to bed and hits for James to finally leave. it seemed as though he was overstaying his welcome. I cannot do every Wednesday with him as I have a life of my own. He promised me that these Wednesdays would eventually evaporate, and he would be spending time with me, but it hasn‚Äôt happened yet. I definitely feel like I am at the point where it‚Äôs either me and spending more time with me or him and his ex and their past relationship. I‚Äôve told him this a few times, but I‚Äôm ready to really let things go. Should I stay with this guy because he‚Äôs a great guy and maybe down the road things will get better? We don‚Äôt spend any time during the week together and he and I only get together on weekends or with the kids, we rarely get date nights or selves, maybe every other weekend, so it makes your every day evenings like cooking dinner together and having wine and talking about your week literally nonexistent. Is it just me or does he have a very unhealthy connection to his ex wife? I‚Äôm trying to support the idea of coparenting which I do, but it seems a bit excessive. They talk every day about the kids and I really don‚Äôt feel like I have much room to start a relationship with him and my kids.",Just because someone is a great guy doesn't make them a great partner - or a great partner *to you*.

We had a great connection, conversation flowed, etc. I stayed the night and wanted to sleep with him since I knew he was about to be out of town for a while butttt i was also expecting my period. I told him and he was reluctant at first but ended up wanting to do it. Without being too graphic, I was on top and it was good at first but then I got my ahem, period, and it was kind of a lot. He said we should probably stop and I agreed and then apologized. He seemed nice about it and said there was no reason for me to apologize because it‚Äôs natural, etc. 

The next day, I felt a shift in his communication & thought maybe he was genuinely busy but from then on, ours texts went from all day to maybe 1-2 a day. I mentioned how embarrassed I was about what happened and he reassured but then dwindled off a few days later til he completely ghosted. 

Before this happened, we were with his friends and he was acting a little distant towards me around them so things did feel a little off then, so idk if something else happened before then.

Tl;dr: I‚Äôm just utterly humiliated about the whole situation and am embarrassed. I feel like he probably told his friends about it and they probably laughed about it. But I‚Äôm more upset with myself for sleeping with him bc I wouldn‚Äôt have done it unless I saw it going somewhere. It hurts that he just ghosted after 4 dates with no explanation and after we slept together and after we had made future plans. How do I recover from this?","Period or no period it sounds like he would have behaved this way all along.

Don't ever be ashamed of your bodily functions. I've had my period twice during early dates without my knowing I was due. One guy totally cool about it the other acted like I was an alien.

Sure it stings but sounds like he was going to do this to you anyway after sleeping together and just a shame it happened during a vulnerable part of the month. 

There is no way to weed them out. Just know you dodged someone not good for you and there is no shame on your part. Give yourself some self compassion here you put yourself out there not knowing what to expect. It's natural. Give it a little time and jump back in the saddle."

Maybe I am wrong, but the Bosnian war was between the Bosniaks and the Serbs. And the Serbs were the real issue here, also the Croatians who I think were finding for the Serbs.

For the year I‚Äôve been here. We talk more and more each time. He used to sit alone until one day there was only one free seat and it was at the bar. Now we talk for hours when he comes in. I love talking to him. He‚Äôs kind, funny, smart and laughs at all of my jokes. 

He has invited me to go meet him before at a bar but I have never went. So we just talk every week at my work. More recently we‚Äôve sat down and talked with each other while I was off work a few times and talked for a few hours. 

Last week, we talked for hours, I got a little tipsy and suggested we go to another bar. He said yes and I was a little shocked because he‚Äôd never stay out too late there.

We had fun, talked a lot, had a really fun walk to the bar. We had a drink or 2 and a shot and I got pretty drunk. I told him about the crush I have on him, then BLANK. I don‚Äôt remember what his response is. I remember him walking me home and us hugging. We were out until 4am. 

I haven‚Äôt been able to stop thinking about it. Should I even talk about this with him when I see him again? Should I apologize? I want to know what he said but scared if the answer might be a rejection.

Edit: I hope I didn‚Äôt try and make any passes or try to do something with him while I was drunk(the parts I don‚Äôt remember). what if I was sloppy?",I suggest being as honest and direct as possible when having the conversation. It might not be comfortable but it will feel better in the long run if you can be straightforward and communicate clearly. You know the situation so you know best but try to think about it from the other person's perspective too and give them the respect they deserve. Best of luck.

When I'm hanging out at a place, occasionally I invite them to join me right then and there and it's worked a couple times to get a casual first date rolling.

Obviously it's dumb if it's like a dirt cheap dive bar or a chain restaurant. But let's say the venue is interesting but also reasonable to hang out at casually. A gastropub or craft brewery or coffee shop

By giving an insight on your life and that you do stuff on your own, it could look impressive/interesting/confident even if she doesn't have time right then.

An invite like this also might look bad on Friday or Saturday night to the party girl type, but could look bad on Monday through Thursday night to the average working woman type.

So

* Weeknight or weekend?

* Daytime coffee shop invite, or night time bar invite?",

dating,143z3gf,1686198167.0,Red üö©(Mormon Mutual),"I met a guy through a dating app called mutual. I don‚Äôt have much dating experience. However, I know what I want and don‚Äôt want. I took a year off dating after my engagement fell through to process my feelings and heal. My past relationship was healthy. He just needed more time for himself. We are still friends.

Anyway, this new guy I met on Mutual seemed promising, handsome,  charming and all the red flags you can think off in the first week of talking stage. The first night we met 10 minutes into knowing each other he trauma dumped his whole life. Why? I don‚Äôt know. I swear I was never seeing him again after because what he confessed was something I never wanted to involve myself with. However, he kept trying to communicate and was kind and pretended to be everything I was looking for ofcourse. I was like what the hell let‚Äôs see, what‚Äôs the worst that can happen? I gave it a chance. I couldn‚Äôt find friends in mutual but eventually found someone we both knew (his ex wife) already sounds messy but I promise it was a coincidence. Our dates went well. He was going too fast, fake futuring, hypersexual, clingy and gave signs of jealous type. Suddenly, after reaching his objective ( u know) he stopped being clingy. He realized we ‚Äúwent too fast and was scared‚Äù lol. Yup the typical avoidant, unavailable man. I immediately felt sick to my stomach because I knew  this was over. He would randomly call me and disappear stating he was busy bla bla. I couldn‚Äôt believe that this was actually happening but as a result of my poor judgment and weakness I deserved it. I knew better. I wasn‚Äôt strong enough to re-state my boundaries and accepted him breaking through the walls.  I automatically knew that if he cared or actually meant anything he would have protected me. However, I could have protect us too and didn‚Äôt. I failed as well. I didn‚Äôt think much of it because adult dating life is like that. It was just hard because I don‚Äôt sleep around. I don‚Äôt have an anxious attachment style but I could tell he did and had very toxic forms of building relationships. I felt it was rubbing off on me. He admitted to have had an extremely toxic past. He always had an excuse for failing me. He was divorced and had a child so I assumed this may had been a contributing factor. He was very mysterious. I started getting a feeling he had a commitment and just used me for sex and fulfilling his fantasies. I began getting rid of every illusion without further confrontation. I accepted my L and felt like I dogged a bullet. Part of me was hoping he would just block me but he didn‚Äôt. I did let him know a couple times before I left him, how he was hurting my feelings and making me feel confused. I expressed that what he was doing to me was not okay. However, he had excuses to justify it. I feel he knew what he was doing and did the typical text here and there to keep me reeled. I felt insane, insecure, not ok and prayed about it and felt it wasn‚Äôt right and he had so much going on. I had to run away because I felt I had been put through some trauma and just the things we did with each other were not ok or normal. To him it was probably another sexual encounter with a girl from a dating app but I believed everything. I needed to cut the root and deleted him. I was scared of him because I feel he just saw me as a piece of meat without clothes and I don‚Äôt feel ok spiritually or morally. Him having access to my photos made me uncomfortable. Here is the bigger red flag‚Ä¶  The last FaceTime I had with him he had someone else on a video/voice call. It was a males voice telling him, ‚ÄúYOUR MIC IS OFF‚Äù. I was very confused, and did not know why he would even have another phone call going or listening to us talk‚Ä¶I continued about my night and tried giving him the benefit of the doubt and not accuse him of anything. I did not hear much from him after because I ghosted him due to all this weird mysterious crap. I even staged a whole fake relationship to make him think I moved on weeks later. A couple days after a black truck pulls up behind me in a hotel I was staying at. To my surprise I was going live for tik tok and the man who approached me walked away. I recorded his face on my live video. I don‚Äôt think it had a connection but the call was very sketchy. I shared this story to ask you guys what you think. Could he have had plans of hurting me more? The guy was just so weird and unavailable. I liked him so much and I still wish him the best but I am not the one haha. After this ordeal, I felt I needed to cut the tie and run away for my life. I‚Äôm grateful that my friend played my boyfriend. I was becoming more toxic than I already was haha. He suddenly became married after this. I was like‚Ä¶. Holy fuck. What a dude. This is the type of stuff you share anonymously.  üòÖ

dating,143z33i,1686198135.0,Need some advice. Anything helps.,"I recently had a date with a girI that I matched with on tinder.

She was about 5 years younger than me. 
What we had in common was that we come from the same culture and the way we were raised was fairly similar. We also speak the same language.
Our date went fine. We spent a few hours together, got coffee. We talked a whole lot and I genuinely enjoyed our time together.

We kept texting back and forth for about a week. Things seem to be going good until she decided to abruptly stop texting me at all. I haven‚Äôt heard from her in days now. 

I‚Äôm not really sure what went wrong or why she stopped talking to me. 

I‚Äôd also like to mention that I‚Äôve dated and been with many girls and I never had this weird feeling before. For some reason I just can‚Äôt stop thinking about this girl. 

Something about this girl did something to me and I‚Äôm not really sure what to think. I sort of feel hurt.

Have you ever met someone that made you feel like this? What should I do about it?","Move on. It could have been a million things, from a lack of chemistry to a lack of physical attraction to a personality/moral incompatibility she didn't elaborate on to becoming serious with another person to an emergency taking up all of her time, none of which are likely to make you feel better. This is part of dating these days. Many people feel ghosting is actually the kinder move before you've become serious. Move on and don't let this fester."

Talk with him, let him know your needs with communication and ask him if he can meet you at the same place. If he can't, ask him if you two can compromise.

He drove and paid for everything. He held my hand a little in the movie but didn‚Äôt try to kiss me at any point in the night. 

He came into my house and we talked for about an hour after the movie, until I started feeling tired, and suggested we call it a night. I knew he had things he wanted to do before Monday too. We said goodnight, which was a little awkward. He apologized for staying late but I told him I was glad he did. I thanked him for coming to church with me and said he was welcome anytime.

dating,143yk8n,1686196613.0,Am I being dense to the fact that she's into me ?,"I (23M) met this girl (30F)  at the gym some time ago. When we first began chatting, there were a couple of signs that led me to believe that she was into me (e.g her complimenting my physique on different occasions, being very open and friendly,etc). The biggest sign that stood out to me was the fact she would always say things along the lines of "" we should hangout together "" or ""hit me up sometime"" (through text). However though, whenever I do hit her up, the same scenario plays out every single time. 

I initially text her first

she responds several hours later

I respond to her message

she leaves me on delivered/read

I've texted her a handful of times with the intention of asking her out at some point during the conversation, but by text #3, before I can even ask, she ignores me. When I check her social media, I see that she always active posting onto her story, etc.

In person, I get the sense that she is very into me, but the struggle to get even a text back from her makes me feel like she's brushing me off. I completely understand that people have their own lives, and own situations that they're dealing with, but the fact that this has happened on numerous occasions  has convinced me that whatever attraction I thought was there, was imagined. If she texted me first at least ONCE, I would still have some type of hope. Am I reading way too much into this, or is it safe to assume to she's not into me?

&#x200B;

TLDR: I think a girl is into me, but I can barely get a text back from her. Safe to say she isn't into me?","No shes not into you at all....she is the ""salesman"" type, the type that talks shit and make you feel special, have a mate like her, every second word is building you up making you feel good ...."

I've seen my shorter friends be brutally rejected by women for just being a few inches shy of 6ft tall.

Anyways, I've been talking to this girl for a few days now and we finally decided on a place to meet up. But now, a day before actually meeting up, she wants to know what my height is because ""she needs someone who's at least 5 ft 10 so she can wear heels).

To be perfectly honest, this is what the early phases of relationships are for: figuring out if you are compatible and whether or not you want to mutually stick around. It takes practice and getting used to, but basically don't be afraid to walk away at any point for any reason, because in the end it's better to be single overall than it is to settle for less than what you want or need."

At the end of the date she insisted on a goodnight kiss and I went along with it.  In the process she bit my lip enough to draw blood.

dating,143uie6,1686185383.0,Are self harm scars a red flag?,It‚Äôs a pretty simple question but I‚Äôd like to know your thoughts. The reason I ask is because I have scars all over my arms and wrist from the past and now in the present I feel very insecure about it. I try to cover them as much as possible but It also doesn‚Äôt help that when my recent ex broke up with me she said I was a red flag without exactly specifying why but I have a gut feeling that one contribution to her thinking that is because I have scars.

If they're not, I'd still be extra careful around that person, fearing for a relapse and for potentially unresolved mental health issues."
dating,143txbs,1686183844.0,Worried gf will cheat on me with her best friend,"My gf told me she used to have a crush on her girl best friend, they're still really close and practically joined at the hip.

She's told me that they even hold hands, and when the bestfriend asked who's hand she preferred holding she said she preferred the bestfriends hand.(I wasn't there when she asked so maybe she said it out of courtesy but still wtf)

And then she also told me that bestfriend ties her shoe lace for her when it comes undone ?

And recently they've gone on a holiday to Morroco together with some of their other uni mates and they're sharing a room, and honestly, after everything she told me, it does have me spooked a bit. 

There's just lots of things that are playing on my mind and it won't stop racing.
Is this just normal girly bestfriend behaviour? I'm not sure, advice, stories or interpretations are welcome.","Yeahhh screams weird red flags to me. Other than the shoelace thing of course lol I don't think that part is too big a deal. Might be worthy of mentioning it to her at this point. I wouldn't be comfortable with that either tbh.

I'm sure some people will play the ""you're insecure"" card here, but to be honest I think the concern is warranted and that this may be something to worry about. Especially if they're traveling alone together."

My brother flew into town a couple weeks ago for a late Mother's Day gift and we went for dinner with out mother he thought the waitress was cute. So he chatted with her through the whole meal here and there. When it was time to pay the bill he pulled her off to the side to pay it so mom wouldn't find out that he paid the bill, anyway he was flirting with her some more and talking to her a bit and totally spaced it and forgot to ask for number and see when she was available while he was in town. Now that he's out of town he asked me if I could go back to that same restaurant a week or two later and asked if she'd be interested for next time when he comes through and finishes moving back home.

dating,143sq97,1686180783.0,Girl switches her interest on and off,One second she could be acting in love with me and then later acts disinterested and leaves me on delivered and distant should I confront her about this?,"Hi there,
Been in this situation a couple weeks ago. I get how confusing it is and deeply feel you

If you really care about the relationship, confront her politely and ask what she thinks about the situation

Mostly, girls do this either because they have low self-esteem and think that using those strategies will ensure you don't lose interest, or because they have no experience / no clue how to handle their attraction towards you.

Either way, if you feel like you'd want some explanation, ask her politely.

dating,143spw6,1686180758.0,Can we have a real discussion about the power of toxicity?,"Now I know that people are going to be very defensive but hear me out. This is genuine concern, but probably nothing new, as we‚Äôve heard it before‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúWhy do good girls like bad guys?‚Äù

Now I have heard women confessing to this more and more. If we look at some posts here, you‚Äôll see a lot of ‚Äúmy boyfriend is cheating, talking to another woman etc‚Äù also with a lot of ‚ÄúI left a good guy‚Äù posts. 

The discussion I want to have is whether you agree as a woman that toxic traits are inherently desirable in a man. As a man, have you come to this realization? Do you believe this is false? 

I believe there has to be some truth to it, and it makes me really sad because I find myself really wanting to lean into these things if it‚Äôs what I need to do to create the opportunity to connect with someone, but it‚Äôs not my natural self, which I think is also important. You can‚Äôt pretend to be toxic. Only authentically is it effective.

We get a lot of this alpha male content on social feeds and I hate pretty much all of it, but I have a feeling women are the ones who actually like it. Even if they love to hate it. I‚Äôve heard women say ‚ÄúAll the guys I dated are toxic..‚Äù and it‚Äôs like, what‚Äôs that all about? Are nice men simply weak and undateable without being attractive? Can we be real about this and not idealistic. I know it could all be BS, but I am hearing women in my own family admit this, and I observe and yes I am envious of these men as well but I don‚Äôt believe they could enjoy a connection the way a genuinely nice person can.

I‚Äôve sometimes felt in the past that dates would accuse me of cheating, almost as if they really wanted me to be. I‚Äôve heard women justify their partners cheating with ‚Äúhe was just being a man‚Äù 

So does this all basically sound stupid to you, or like the truth? Whats your take on it. Do I need to be toxic as hell to find love?","I think that toxic/damaged people are attracted to other toxic/damaged people. The more emotionally intelligent/mentally healthy people are, from what I've seen, the more they are looking for mentally healthy things in relationships. 

If everyone you are running into is toxic, i think it's time you maybe sit with who you are attracted to and why you are attracted to them."

Before I left this morning I told her I really liked the date and that I hope we can have another one. She basically said the same.

dating,143rzcl,1686178938.0,What do you all think of this situation?,"So last week, I (28m) met a woman (23f) at work. We were both subs at a school and ran into eachother frequently. The last hour of the day pretty much had us acting as hall monitor. 

We talked the while time and she was very playful in our conversations. I decided to go for it and ask her to join me at a brewery in town, she said yes and we met up there shortly afterwards. 

I was only expecting to be there for an hour, but the conversations kept going on and they started to become more personal and flirtatious. One hour turned into four, and during that time she initiated hand holding. Prolonged and holding with smiles and eye contact. She put her number into my phone too! I was on cloud 9! 

After we finally decided to make our way home I walked her out to her car and we stood there looking into eachothers eyes. She leaned in and I kissed her. We kissed multiple times and held out foreheads together in between. 

I texted her two days later with who I was and asked her how her weekend was. She left me on read. No biggie. 

Then I texted her two days after that I asked her to come with me to a museum in a nearby city the following weekend. (this was something we had in common). 
She left me on read again. This kinda struck me as really odd, but it's not like something like this has happened before with me.

dating,143rp5d,1686178240.0,"Dating this girl is so, so exhausting (rant/venting)","Excuse me if I sound a bit aggravated and on edge in this post. It's been a long couple of weeks. If you think I'm an asshole, fine, whatever.

So, here's some background. I've been dating this girl for a month and a half. At first I thought she was the ultimate package. Smart, cute, funny. That lasted for a few dates and then the reality of what it would be like dating her set in.

She almost never initiates. If I want to hear from her, I have to message her. If I want to cuddle, I have to ask for it. She loves to go on and on about her life and what she's doing at work (fine) but NEVER asks about what I like to do or what I'm doing (NOT FINE). She repeats the same things to me over and over again like I am a child with zero capacity to remember things. This makes me feel like the most pathetic person alive. The idea that I would have to beg this girl for a crumb of cuddle is just humiliating.

I, being the idiot I am, decided to ask if she wanted to make things official despite these problems.

She said not yet and her reason for that answer was because she didn't know me well enough yet. She wants to meet my friends, know about my childhood, what I like to do in my free time, etc. And I'm sitting there thinking: ""Then why didn't you ask on any of the 6 dates we went on? Were you just not listening when I talked about what I enjoy doing?""

She said she wants to do some cooking at my place. Finally, some initiation. Ok, we can work with this. And then she proceeds to have absolutely ZERO idea what to make with me, leaving me to come up with an idea and buy all of the ingredients.

I am an extremely busy person. My time is extremely valuable and I figured 1.5 months was long enough for her to make a decision on this considering her last relationship ended at 2 months.The obvious answer is ""Lol stop dating her then."" Yeah, you're probably right. But I feel like a serious conversation about where things are going is necessary because who knows? Maybe she just doesn't realize how she comes off?

Dating was exciting at first but now I'm just exhausted and extremely frustrated. Am I just desperate? Probably but I would unironically prefer being single over this one-sided dating","You sound like a chump dude get it together.  The questions you posed you already know the answer to come on

dating,143rmxu,1686178084.0,my (25f) boyfriend (29m) thinks i'm controlling when it comes to his friends,"i have no idea where to even post this because relationship subreddits keep deleting my shit for moral judgement and stuff. buckle up, this is a long one. 

but i am legitimately bummed out by this situation but my (25f) boyfriend (29m) thinks i am controlling for voicing my opinions of his friends. some background: we have been dating for almost a year and a half and live together. i personally think his friends are pretty shitty. i don't appreciate being thought of as controlling, especially if his friends have shown themselves to be so crummy. i want to start off with his friend, who i will call red. i have hung out with red and other friends in the group and found him to be quite the narcissist. i had set up my own friend with red and she immediately caught on to his act. she agrees that he is narcissistic and was disinterested in him after a few small conversations. on a different event, i had planned a birthday party for my boyfriend and was hoping to invite red. having mentioned this to another close friend of my bf, he disclosed that he was not comfortable with him being there. i guess there is some sort of history between them all and many people in this group of friends do not like red. unfortunately, i was unable to reach out because i didn't know how to go about it. it didn't feel like it was my place and it would be super awkward to be like ""the friend group doesn't want you to be there"". i had reached out a couple times after my bf's birthday party, that i posted about online, and he just never responded. i thought i was doing my best to make sure he was okay and he just never bothered to respond or even look at my messages. but i think that itself should say everything about this person. i am also always uncomfortable with the fact that he gawks and treats women like objects too.  
  
as for the other part of the friends my bf talked to the most, they have been unwelcoming since the day i met them. they never really invited me to any gaming sessions they had and it was always just my bf, they have made me feel so left out. they never give me any chances to speak up whenever we would hangout. i always felt so alienated with them because they wouldn't acknowledge what i would say and would move on from it. there were often times were i was just so uncomfortable i had to excuse myself to cry. it might be a little extreme of a reaction but i would also blame it on the fact that my bf never really reassured me. he still hasn't defended me either. so overall, i just felt like i was alone and at a loss.  
  
as mentioned above, the unwelcoming party includes: sensitive topic guy, ben and his girlfriend tina, and jerry. out of all of those people, i think that jerry is the better part of all of them. there were times when we were gaming that he would teach me how to play the games or tried to make small talk. it just sucks that he is associated with these people. so i get a little bummed out when my bf talks to him. this i will be hashing out with my therapist but i really just think it's because jerry is always connected to ben, tina, and sensitive topic guy. ben is one of my bf's closest friends so my bf doesn't want to lose their friendship, which i get. but he himself has told me that ben has changed a lot since getting with tina and that these changes weren't good. tina has a history of flirting with red and another friend. the first time i had met her and ben, she had been a little flirty with my bf. along with how she has no regard for other people unless it involves her directly. sensitive topic guy has once brought up an event that many joke about but unfortunately, it was something i had gone through. i'm over it now as i've been talking about it in therapy sessions but when he made a specific joke about it, no one said anything. i was still hurting over what had happened because it clearly is traumatizing. so at that point i was like ??? these are the people you want to associate with?  
  
am i insane for feeling this way? i feel like i have every right to feel this way about these people because 1) i had never been defended for by their shitty actions and 2) it just seems so wrong to associate with them. as they say, you are the company that you keep. and i do not want to be with someone who acts in the same manner or even just brushes it off.  
  
TLDR; my boyfriend has some shitty friends that he still wants to hang out with and he called me controlling","> i have every right to feel this way

You absolutely do

> i don't appreciate being thought of as controlling, especially if his friends have shown themselves to be so crummy.

If you try to keep your bf from hanging out with his friends you are being controlling. You not liking his friends doesn't change that. Even if his friends are legitimately crap, it doesn't make it 'not controlling'. 

> my bf never really reassured me. he still hasn't defended me either

There seems to be a mismatch between what you and he think is acceptable when hanging out with his friends. If you really feel strongly about *this* though, you should probably break up and find someone who matches better with you."

I‚Äôm very aware that I‚Äôm attractive, and I mean this in the least cocky way. I‚Äôm not that kind of person. 

I go to the gym 5 times a week, own a house, have a excellent job and degree. I wonder if all of these traits add to intimidation as well?

I have run into so many times guys that ask me out,  blatantly tell me they don‚Äôt want to ‚Äúdo too much‚Äù because they ‚Äú know a bunch of guys are on me‚Äù. There‚Äôs always an assumption I deal with this rotation of men, and that they practically throw themselves at me.

In public I get hit on from time to time, but for the most part I notice stares but they don‚Äôt always actually approach.

I‚Äôm not trying to come off as a vain self centered POS. Please don‚Äôt take it that way. I‚Äôm truly trying to see what goes through a guys mind when they see an attractive woman. Is it intimidating? Is it not intimidating? Would like some male perspective here.","32m recently seperated from a 9 year relationship. Right now at this present moment I am not in the mind set to approach any good looking woman. Lets just say I lack the confidence as of right now although I guess I am pretty good looking, muscular body, great job, have my own house and car. Being out of the game for 9 years has took its toll on my ability to talk with woman. 
I notice this and I am working on myself and rebuilding my ability to be able to not give a fuck and just approach.

I can speak for most men that the fear of rejection plays a crucial role in not approaching. It could be trauma from childhood, past experiences,  or just pure anxiety. Men look at a beautiful girl and think I have nothing to offer her, she is to good for me and will not approach. I have the same mindset as of now.

But really our additude should be ""I bet I can improve her life, I better talk to her because she may miss out on something good"". We lack the thought that we are the ""good catch"".

My ex was the one who approached me in the gym. And the moment she did that I opened up completely and felt super comfortable because I knew for a FACT she was interested in me. It made everything so much easier.

I know I cant sit around and expect that to happen again thats why I am reading books and educating myself to help build the confidence to just go out and get rejected and that it is ok. Id rather attempt and get rejected than not even try at all."

Serious look ( work on being more relaxed and smirking, no one will approach you with a serious gaze and if you approach a girl with that look you might as well walk right by her)

No idea what youre doing ( you gotta build confidence, look up dating coaches ,read books, practise in and out conversations ""Hey Miss, where did you get that load of bread ive been looking everywhere for it, (she tells you) ok thanks alot have a good day"".

I‚Äôm a 28 y/o software engineer, grew up coding, met my first gf on an MMO, made a bunch of games, wrote my own smartwatch OS, play Valorant‚Äî stuff like that.

Broke up with my gf of ~4 years, trying to get back into it. I work remotely now, so I can‚Äôt make friends through work.

I also just moved from CA -> NJ, so I‚Äôm kind of screwed and feel I have to rely on dating apps.

So at the beginning we talked about a serious relationship and he said that he doesn't want a serious relationship at the moment, but he liked me and I seemed like a mature person and a potential person for a serious relationship.  I agreed with him about it and said that I don't want to force anything and that I don't have a problem to wait because I'm not in a hurry and if it needs to be something more it will come in its own time.

Now this is the first time when I am with a guy who i really like and he is mature and we have the same energy and I am in a dilemma where I don't know how to act correctly. I'm wondering if it's worth it to wait some more and hope he changes his mind about a relationship, or should I end it while it's still time. 

I also have a problem with my past relationships as they were toxic and I always reacted violently and got jealous if I found out my ex-boyfriends were in contact with other girls or were out late at night, I suspect I had trust issues due to being cheated on  from the first boyfriend. 

So at the moment this guy and I get along and we both have freedom and we are having a great time when we are together, and I have changed and I no longer react violently in such situations and everything is okay and I have a lot of trust in him, but deep inside me while I'm thinking alone at night about this situation, there are still those problems with trust.

dating,143ow3p,1686171697.0,Texted a girl I haven't seen in 7 years,"So I've known her as she used to stick with us in our friend group a couple of years ago, but nothing special, we just met at bars during the weekends and sent each other funny stuff on facebook. Then we disappeared from each others' lives around the time when I got in a serious relationship and so on...  
  
Two weeks ago friday I texted her out of curiosity. She immediately texted back, was very friendly and inquiring, and it felt like all those years between did't happen.  
  
We met next day - like 30 hours after I contacted her - so in a blink of an eye for the first time since 2016 she was sitting next to me (I was out in the city with friends on a saturday night). And the way I look at her now is so different.  
  
She was very open and talkative, shared a lot about her life, highlighted how she ended her last relationship last year and she's single now and lives alone. We made lots of plans for the following weeks for events to meet up again. I bought her a beer, and she repeatedly said how she'd like to return next time we meet. So anyway, I know it means nothing, but her behavior is quite... encouraging. We met again a week later with friends, spent the night out, walked her home, hugged, and that was it.  
  
I'm just not sure what my next step should be. I don't wanna swarm her with texts and think patience would be wiser, and neither I want to ruin a friendship, but I feel like I wanna keep in touch with her all the time, and it's shaping up to be something more in my head. We're regurarly talking and planning what to do together next, but it's only with other people, not like a date.  
  
I'm just asking for opinions, advices, especially from women. What would be the right approach if I wanna get closer and take things to the next step?","Just be casual. There are subtle behaviors in communication that *may* lead the other person to understanding what your motives are. Unless you know that this person would be into a more personal relationship with you, treat them well and don‚Äôt breathe down their neck."
dating,143oq4i,1686171334.0,"How to approach dating as someone who hasn't dated in 22 years? Folks who don't date, the answers will help you.","I'm 22 years old, male. 

Reasons I haven't dated: 

1. I was/am shy. I couldn't start a conversation and keep it going. I'm becoming less shy. 
2. I think I'm below average looking. So? Nothig, I wasn't/am not confident . Improving on that. 
3. I'm fucking poor. I have absolutely nothing. NOTHING. I haven't fixed that yet, but I have some spare money now. I might earn more. I haven't fix my teeth and something else. Improving
4. Pandemic. I stayed at home most of the time. Who am I going to meet?
5. When I was younger, until I was 18, my mom had an attitude of ""no girls at all"". She scolded me whenever I talked about girls. ""You can't even cook, why getting a girlfriend then!!?"" She said to me. Not only I was shy, but this attitude of hers didn't help at all.  (I think you didn't have to do that, mom)
6. I was overweight. As overweight as a cow. (fat as fuck, but didn't need like a tow or something)

So, that's me: no money, not good looking, not good with people or relationships in general, not a big dick. I'm ***not*** attractive at all. 

As you could read, I'm improving. There was a girl in a course I took (I'm in uni. Engineering. Uni is a fucking waste of time). I want to describe how she truly is physically (but I feel like this post would get down just because people feel offended at the truth), so let's say she's a solid 5.5/10... maybe 6/10... maybe. She's enough. I asked her out, but we've been delaying the date because of fucking uni projects. 

I don't know if she's interested, at least she hasn't said a straightforward no, but just imagine what she's getting:

1. A poor, below average looking, no big dick, inexperienced **fucking 22 year old male**. 

Is that the boyfriend you want as a girl? I don't think so. 

Some people start dating at 13-14 yo. WTF!!?? I have so many disadvantages. So many. I feel like shit. They already know how to get girls and how to date (I feel jelous of them).

**My question is how do you handle the dates?**  I'll take her out for luch (if she accepts first), and then what? What's the other date going to be about? How do I turn her, until then, my gf? 

To be honest, I'm not even sure if I want her to be my girlfriend. She's pretty, but she lacks something I really like. I want her for one thing she has, and I hope she has it otherwise this will turn into a bet. She's pretty enough. 

Given the above information:

**What is the process of turning this now strange girl into my girlfriend?** 

Should I tell her she's my first gf at **fucking 22?**

**How do you handle the relationship once she's my gf?**

I think the last question is the second most important. Please help. 

**PS**

I'm not a bad man if you conclude that from this post. 

&#x200B;

Thanks for your time. I wouldn't ask for help if I didn't need it.","Hey there friend! Take it as it comes. Frankly speaking, most if not all uni/college students are broke. 

As for looks, confidence and dick size‚Ä¶ some of this you have control over and some you don‚Äôt. A big Dick is far less important than porn would have you believe. As far as weight and looks, if you feel your not where you want to be with your weight, work out. If you‚Äôre confidence is lacking about your looks, find features about yourself you or others like/compliment and dress/accessorize to hi light those features. 

Also, confidence is internal not external. I‚Äôm sorry you feel this way about yourself but you alone have the power to change that. No amount of external validation will make you confident in yourself. YOU have to choose to love and appreciate yourself and that will manifest as confidence. If a woman doesn‚Äôt find you attractive that‚Äôs her problem not yours. Keep it moving and get some experience. There are plenty of women who will cherish your mind over your body. 

Sorry for rambling there was a lot to unpack here but the point I want you to take away is: go for it with the girl and learn to accept yourself. 





Inexpensive date ideas:

1. Go on a picnic. 

2. Go for a hike or walk somewhere scenic

3. Visit a local museum

4. Invite her to play a board game

5. Maybe find an open mic night at a local comedy club. 

6. If either of you has a car: go on a scenic day trip. 

7. Cook a meal together

He works full time and is starting an apprenticeship, I work full time and i‚Äôm full time in college. We see each other for about 24 hours every 4 weeks when one of us makes the drive on our day off. 

The weekend coming up I happen to have Saturday, Sunday, and part of Monday off. A week ago he took off Saturday, Sunday, and Monday because he was debating attending a wedding. As the week has progressed he has hinted several times that he does not see a point in going to the wedding because he is not close with the people getting married. His family has been pressuring and guilt tripping him about wanting to see me for longer instead of going to the wedding so he changed his answer later in the week to a ‚Äúmaybe i‚Äôll go, i‚Äôll decide as it gets closer‚Äù. I mentioned how it was my grandmas birthday on Sunday and we would love it if he was there to which he basically said that he would be. 

Now it is Wednesday and I told him I needed a definite answer on if he would be staying Sunday and Monday because my job is asking me to pick up shifts for a really good bonus. He said he would not be staying and that he had already told me that. I am obviously extremely upset because he had not told me that, it was still undecided. He thinks I am overreacting. 

I do not think I am overreacting because I was truly under the impression that he thought the wedding was pointless in attending and now we will only be able to spend time together Saturday even though we both have 3 days off.

dating,143nvoc,1686169439.0,I had terrible sex with the guy I'm seeing and I'm nor sure if I want to continue.,"\*TLDR\*

I know how it sounds but listen,

For some back story I started seeing him about a month and a half ago. He's sweet, couldn't wait to see me whenever we planned to hangout, has a good job, own place etc. 

The other night we went out and when I say I got drunk, I got DRUNK. He was buying me drink after drink and when we finally got back to his place, we were kissing and ended up having sex. He went down on me first and it was really good, but he only did it for a minute maybe. I even asked him to keep doing it and he ignored me and took the rest of my clothes off. He asked me to go down on him next so I did. I was really surprised bc his penis is about the size of my pinkies put together (length and width) I chose not to let it be something ""bad"" just because i've never experienced it.  While I was returning the favor, he had almost reaction and then finished in about 30 seconds. Then he told me he could ""go again"" so I said yes. 

Mind you, my foot was hurt and he knew this, he put me on top of him anyway. So I went with it, maybe he forgot and maybe I could get through if the pain wasn't bad. I couldn't really feel much of anything but I was trying my best to make the situation work I asked him if he liked it and he said ""yes"" very mono-tone he didn't make eye contact with me. I asked if there was anything he wanted me to do and he just shook his head squinting his eyes. After 5 mins I was hurting and I told him my foot was bothering me. He said to ""keep going, I'm almost done"" he finished again about a minute after. 

He was normal the next day, back to being sweet and attentive. Then he made a joke about ""getting drunk by the pool and have a repeat of last night"" like does he want to have sex with me while I'm drunk bc he doesn't want me to remember or what? I just feel uneasy about the way he treated me during sex, like he didn't care about my needs at all and he just seemed in a hurry to get off.

before anyone asks, yes he was fully erect and no he was not drunk at all I'm not sure if I want to continue seeing him after this or even how to end it if I decide to.","Penis size aside, he doesn‚Äôt sound like a very considerate lover. That likely isn‚Äôt going to get better."

What are her intentions, and what do I do?",Even I'm confused why she would sleep over to watch pornography with you. That's kind of a weird thing to do.

They‚Äôve made certain comments so I am not interested in entertaining any of them. 

Well there is one guy that I like. I haven‚Äôt talked to him much because I don‚Äôt see him as often and I‚Äôm also pretty shy and socially awkward. He is also a bit shy and more reserved which I like. I‚Äôm not into the loud obnoxious men like other coworkers who have hit on me.

Well my friend knows him. His brother is friends with him outside of work so he knows him pretty well. He‚Äôs mentioned that he is shy and pretty respectful. He doesn‚Äôt participate in the gossip. My friend told me that before I even mentioned liking this guy, he had told my crush that he should ask me out.

But, my crush said that he didn‚Äôt wanna be on the list of guys who try to hit on me and that he didn‚Äôt think I liked him. Now I think he said I don‚Äôt like him because I get too nervous to talk. As far as him not being on the list, is it because he doesn‚Äôt wanna be creepy? Or he thinks I‚Äôll reject him too?",Yes

dating,143n70h,1686167842.0,My bf is hanging out with his ex crush,"

Me and my bf share a lovely relationship and we both love each other a lot. We've together since 1.5 years and we just lived in together for 3 months and went back into long distance a week ago. We miss each other terribly and really miss spending time with each other. 

However this girl who's been his friend since 3 years recently had a breakup with her long term boyfriend and her and my bf got in touch again since they have been good friends. They lost touch for a while since we'd be living in together but now they've been hanging out together at his place. My bf developed feelings for her for a while when they were getting to know each other 3 years back and they used to spend a lot of time hanging out. My bf never confessed his feelings to her until very late (at that time she had a bf). That confession didn't effect their friendship and they've been friends ever since. 

However idk I've always had a problem with her and my bf hanging out together. They chill in the same setting and me my bf do. They hangout at his place in his room and they smoke up together listening to songs and sharing each others playlist. Today they met again and my bf made her lsiten to the songs that I share with him. Music to me is very personal and idk why I feel so jealous when they listen to songs and chill together getting high in a room alone when I can't even meet him rn. 

I know that he's extremely loyal and he keeps reassuring me saying that she's just a friend. We've also had fights over this. Please tell me if I'm being irrational or not? 

The biggest red flag that I find is that they hardly talk about their respective boyfriends and I remember once my bf told me that he was not ready for me and her to meet yet. She also never even introduced her bf (now her ex) to my bf and I believe that these are the small little things that I find problematic. Not to talk about the whole getting high together and making each other listen to their fav songs situation. 

It's really pissing me off. Please help. whenever I express to him that I don't like this, he generally gets mad and pissed at me because I am being insecure and overthinking over a friendship..","Hi , I am so sorry you feel that way. Personally, I would straight up ask the guy, if he still has feelings for the girl.  And not to block my path, waste my time for my future husband. He needs to make his mind. And be upfront that you don‚Äôt like this a bit and even he will not like it if you did that same thing to him. If he understands and listen to you , very well. If he wants to keep me or the other girl both , boy that is so not going to happen. Anyways , good luck"
dating,143mmsa,1686166528.0,Can anybody share with me their success with online dating?,"I've been having a bit of a dry spell lately. About 2 months ago , I deleted all my online dating profiles after a really bad hookup. And I am beginning to lose faith in online dating and finding love again after getting dumped from a 3 year relationship. I DID find one guy who seems to like me and respect me. We have a lot in common so much, in fact, that he feels like the boy version of me, and so it seems that we may be compatible. The only problem is he lives in California and I live in oregon and flights can be pricy. Apart from him, I haven't really found anybody else that is good for me on online dating, so I would like to know if anybody else has had better luck than i have on dating apps. And if so what is your tips/advice? 
I'm starting to lose hope....","As someone who wasted his time on online dating for years... stay off those dating sites. They'll make you feel a deep sense of loneliness after using them too long to a crippling degree. Hooking up often only increases the loneliness since there's no real connection there and only a void after you leave each other. I wouldn't lose faith in dating as a whole though, as on online dating you're typically not finding nearly as many people that are both of high quality, and of similar values. My advice to you would be to fill up your time with things you enjoy or want to work on. Make your life something you enjoy, and you'll find someone along the way that you enjoy doing fun things with! I thought that was a load of bullcrap till I got off my depressed butt and actually did something that wasn't sitting around sad that I didn't have someone (not saying you're doing this, but it's definitely something I did a lot when online dating got me as sad as it did). Practice being friendly and talking to people too, as being a good conversationalist is an excellent skill in the dating world and instantly makes you more attractive to everyone around you. I suffer from crippling social anxiety, but I have to say, after facing my fears on it and forcing myself to talk to others and be friendly to folks I don't know, my outlook on life, confidence, and dating life has been much better and I've found much higher quality people to date by meeting them in person. Online dating is inherently shallow in nature and very reaction based, which isn't what you need in a man, but it is exactly the type of man that is frequently found there (same with women too unfortunately, there's just no winning lol). Focus on building friendships with people and solid ones at that! Also have a good focus on being active and healthy both in body and in mind. If you can do that, you'll eventually draw a guy in without any issues that will be a much better match than anything online dating has to offer you. Why? Because you will both be at your best and both of you will be fully ready for a relationship.  I'm not saying the dating sites never work, but I am saying that they often bring out the worst in people, and it would be to your benefit to stay off them since it has a way of making good people to date extremely depressed and difficult to date due to excessive and unhealed baggage that only keeps being added onto."

dating,143l2s0,1686162901.0,In a weird limbo state with a girl I started seeing,"I'm 20M currently in college and recently met a girl from hinge to go on a date with. The first date was great because it was simple ice cream and walking around getting to know eachother and a lot of the physical touch barrier was broken. We ended off with a hug which felt appropriate. We even saw eachother later that day to go jogging around the track lol. 

However, we ended up seeing eachother just a couple days after at the gym, and then the next day to play soccer with some people. Maybe this is just me but I found it really hard to escalate any further than the first date so it was a just more hugging and some light hearted flirty touches here and there. 

The next time we saw eachother was just a few days after that but it was brief for 20 mins because she said she would be hanging out with her friends nearby at the park. We talked quickly and then she left with her friends.

Now I think it's really great to see this person like 5 times in one week but I can't help but feel like we're in this weird limbo state of going on 'dates' but very surface level when it comes to physicality. I'm starting to think that if we just had 2-3 dates with a more romantic setting we could be way further along. But also maybe I'm thinking I should just make a move in these scenarios anyways and kiss her after soccer or something lol.

dating,143kxm9,1686162560.0,Why don't things work out for me?,"This might feel like more of a vent, but the hing is I am frustrated with myself and don't understand why life didn't turn out the way I expected it to. 

I am gonna be 24 this month, and all this while hardly has it been that someone was interested to date me. I have been expecting it since maybe school days, and am a much better person today then I used to be back then. But despite all my growth as a person, I never got to date anyone. I got a wonderful career out of my college but no interest from any girl. 

On top of that, I once came across someone who seemed like the perfect girl based on the compatibility and connection I felt, but it never got reciprocated from her side and it fucked up with my mental health for 4+ years. 

So, in terms of finding love, things have been awful for me, all while I expected to make good achievements. Not perfect achievements, but definitely something where I come across some good experience every now and then. And definitely never wished to be turned down by someone with whom I felt such a great connection with. I am not sure if there will ever be someone with whom I will feel the same connection again. 

And I don't even have anyone to talk to, in order to keep my peace of mind while being so frustrated. No family or friend to share this to. At least none who knows how to console me. And platforms where I earlier used to go to find support are full of people who act more like I am a burden, and hardly wish to listen to me. I wonder where are all the people who gave me so much support 4 years back. I have been tired of trying to share my problem there and seeing people react like my problem doesn't matter because, "" You're young, so this is not a real problem. Decades later, the right person will dramatically stumble upon you"".

Also, despite tons of work my confidence is always not very good, if not very low in real. It all declined when I was a kid and didn't know how to handle life but now that I am 24 and have spent years working on it, I am still on a level where probably I become unattractive because of coming across as someone with low confidence. It's so frustrating that all while my self-image is "" I am wonderful and have a wonderful potential "", every day it becomes a struggle to be a normally confident person which majority of people are. 

So how do I finally start making things work? Why am I not one of those who frequently get to date, are highly likeable by the opposite sex and experience good things frequently in their dating life, instead of being someone who despite all efforts gets nothing?",

For context, I (23M) am together with my GF (23F) for a few months now. I myself only had 2 serious relationships but she interacted in a lot of sexual stuff with strangers like making out, FWB, ONS. Consider the number is around 20. 

Personally, my gf is everything I want from a woman. But her sexual past has been bothering me sometimes. 

I do not have a problem with people doing casual sex. In fact, me and my gf were supposed to be a one night stand. But we liked each other and started dating. 

I know this is an insecurity issue and I'm working on it. Been researching about this issue called ""Retroactive Jealousy"" and would plan to go therapy once I have the budget to do so. I want to resolve this issue because even if I do break up with my GF now, I doubt another girl would be better than her history-wise. It's 2023 for god's sake. 

Well, that's how I deal with it. I'm not gonna say 100% im over it. Sometimes I think about it sometimes I don't. But I tell myself I won't let something like this ruin my day. In fact, I'm happy that I did not need to have   sex with strangers to have fun and be confident.

I found him cute and very shy. I remember he said to me that night ""I'm very happy to have met you, really"", and I found it strange that he told me that already. He made me listen to his favorite songs that night (all sad songs). He is extremely shy, it was me who asked if I could kiss him and it happened. We exchanged numbers and it turned out we were both planning to go to the same rave in 2 weeks. We haven't spoken in between and so I saw him again a week ago. We couldn't hang out too much, we kept getting lost and he kept disappearing with his friend.  
  
He texted me the next day to apologize and say he thought it was a shame we couldn't talk enough. So I suggested we go for a drink in a park. We did that last Friday. It was amazing. We saw each other at 7 p.m. and we stayed at the park until 11 p.m., then raved until 7am. We kissed a lot, he also admitted to me that he is shy and that I intimidate him. He told me that this evening at the park is an ""unforgettable memory"" for him. We met again on Saturday for another rave, my friends were there too, I suggested he comes to mine after. We didn't have sex, we just hugged a lot, he held my hand a lot and pressed it hard, he gave me a lot of kisses on the forehead and cheeks.

As a guy in early 20s, having bad experience with online dating etc, I tend to distance myself from such things, unfortunately, I recently met a girl and I want your opinion on her behaviour.  
  
So, this girl is two years older than me, lives around 3hours away from me. She has a boyfriend and they have been together for 5-6 years now. I can't tell much for their relationship but I can say that she is the ""guy"" in the relationship.  
  
Anyway, we met almost two months ago, we started hanging out in a group chat in the start, then swapped to a private chat/talk. Slowly, we started exchanging gifs, cute things, etc - I know, it's cringe, it's online things but a lot of friends have met their SO in online environment.  
  
BEFORE I CONTINUE, I do not plan to neither destroy her relationship, nor to do a thing with her while in a relationship, I clearly want to know why is this girl doing these things.  
  
We exchanges phone numbers and for the past month, we talk daily, she even wake me up everyday for work to be sure that I am not going to be late. She would sacrifice time of her sleep time to stay with me till late night. We would also call from time to time while having work break for 10-15 minutes.  
  
I know that everything can be seen as just ""being friendly and enjoying fresh company"" but I would draw the line at the calls. I would never sacrifice daily time of my OWN time calling someone else earlier to wake them up, or I wouldn't stay till late night with someone if I do not enjoy them more than just a friend.  
  
As mentioned, our chats are either flirting, talking about our jobs, sending memes or just a normal topic.  
  
I would love some opinion on this. If a girl has attention, boyfriend etc etc - why would she sacrifice sleep time for someone else, me in this scenario?","\>Girl is 3 hours away from me, has a boyfriend, flirts with me on the phone

I have a crush on her but I‚Äôve never really told her. We are getting along really good and we trust eachother. When I ask something about her personal life she is not answering in short little sentences but opens herself to me by writing really long texts. Currently we have this kind of ‚Äûrunning gag‚Äú, that we‚Äôre married and we do this and that but only as long as our imaginary rings stay on our finger, since she asked me out on a prom on the next thursday. What im worried about is that she is actually just using me as a second option so that she isn‚Äôt going to the prom with empty hands. Her female friends told me that she has other dudes and that I am not her type. She never said something like that to me. But there is this one guy she is stressing over where she tells me that she doesn‚Äôt have any feelings for but she lowkey likes him. She said that she was sad because he talked to his ex instead of doing something with her. 

What can I do?","You sound young. You can try hanging out with her and maybe feelings will develop. You can just ask her out to, worst case she says no. Crushes are great but don't let them become a obsession. There are tons of other girls. Try and date someone else and who knows she might come around later."

dating,143hpbc,1686154955.0,Why is a love and devotion of 'travelling' such a crucial requirement for online dating?,"What is with everyone's obsession with travelling? Why is this an essential relationship requirement? It's like saying you like sex, you like sleep, everyone loves to travel. But it's NOT a personality trait, it's so basic and common. Thing is, if I'm dating someone, I want to get to know them, go and do fun activities, be spontaneous etc, THEN if we've been together for a solid year THEN I'll start spending loads of my hard earned cash on a instagram worthy vacation to whereever or a city break etc etc, but like even if they were offering to go halves (which rarely happens) I just don't see what the big rush is? We need to be able to have fun in each other's company in local fun spots etc and chilled vibes first before spending loads of time and money on travelling.   
  
Also, vacations are all I can ever do.. because, well, I have to work.  There seems to be a lot of dating profiles being like ""you MUST be a man with his shit together, don't want a boy, want a man"" then yet ""must be willing to be my travel buddy wanna travel the world for a whole year"" okay so, I do have my shit together, I'm a homeowner, I have a career, I can't just drop all of that for someone I've just met just  because they want some pretty pictures for their instagram. ","Not everyone who wants/loves to travel can afford to do it very often. A lot of people just mean that they want someone who is curious about the world around them, and would travel with them if presented with the opportunity. It‚Äôs a way to weed out people who only want to stay inside and/or live monotonous lives."
dating,143hiyi,1686154548.0,How should I as a man handle potential female interest?,"I feel this have happened to me over and over again since teenage, at work, in school, at hobbies or whatever. A woman behave in ways that makes me think she might be interested in me, but I'm too unsure and in the end it goes nowhere. Sometimes I regret it, sometimes I don't. But with the open ending I'm always a bit curious what could have been. Then there are times when I'm convinced she really likes me and all of sudden she tells me about her husband. I just find it so hard to read the signs and know the difference between companionship and interest in something more.

Now there's this girl at work who I feel seems to go the extra mile to socialize with me.. but then again, maybe she's just social. Assuming she's into me, what am I supposed to do? Should I jeopardize our relation and the social dynamic at my workplace and ask here out? She's only working there temporarily, but I still feel like I might break a trust and end up a creep. If you where a female interested in a male, how would you like him to answer it? Is there anyway to be more sure, or be more smoothed about it?

Right now I'm actually thinking about straight up ask her if she likes me or it's me misinterpreting her intention. Would that be weird?",

I have no idea why or if it‚Äôs because of something I said Is this something that normally happens?,Sounds strange. Maybe she was expecting you to reciprocate the physical advances?
dating,143h8b1,1686153876.0,My partner never takes me out on dates and it is driving me crazy,"Basically the title. 

I have taken my bf out on dates, but I feel less inclined to because he rarely does it for me in return. So I guess it's been a while, since I don't want to be the only one putting in that effort. I should preface this by saying, he does buy dinner to make at home often because he works at a grocery store, so he usually grabs something for dinner before he leaves work. And I do appreciate that a lot. But he also constantly asks me to send him money too. Which is fair, I don't have an issue pitching in. It's just, I wish he was more of a ""provider"" type of guy instead of a ""every last thing needs to be split 50/50"" type of guy.

I (25F) love going on dates and spending quality time together outside of the house. My partner (25M) on the other hand, rarely wants to go out on dates. And when we do, he always wants to split the bill or have me ""pay him back later"". Which just makes me feel like we're grabbing a bite or hanging as friends, and not like he actually is taking me out on a date. 

Even when I get him to agree to eating out, he literally ALWAYS insists on just getting take-out and refuses to eat out at a restaurant with me like 99% of the time. Even when I heavily insist on wanting to get out of the house and enjoy each others company elsewhere, he moans and groans and complains about it, and counter insists that we don't. I feel like I have to beg him sometimes, which ultimately takes the joy out of doing it at all.

I told him recently that I'd love to go out to eat at this burger joint next to our place and enjoy a cocktail on the patio since it was sunny and beautiful outside. I practically had to beg him to sit down there with me, and once we got there, he insisted sitting indoors. Even though he knew the reason I wanted to go, was to sit outside on the patio and enjoy the nice weather. So yeah, we just sad inside and it kind of bummed me out. 

In my past relationships, my past partner's would take me on dates a lot. My ex previous to my current partner took me out several times a week. I know that's a lot to ask for, and I don't expect that of my current partner, but this is a huge change from going on dates all the time, to literally never. 

I don't want to sound like some spoiled brat. I just want that effort. I want to feel like there is still romance and excitement, and like he is still courting me. He does other things to make me feel loved, but this is an important form of bonding for me and it just feels completely unsatisfactory. I don't like feeling like I have to beg to go on a date where I will end up paying for myself. It doesn't feel like ""dating"" at all.

Am I the only one who feels this way or has this experience? I'm not content with this dynamic, but I don't see it changing honestly. I don't want to say this is a deal breaker, but it's bothering more and more as time goes on. 

I'd feel so much more inclined to take him out on dates and pay for it in full, if he did it too sometimes. I always imagined my forever partner as more of a provider. He's great in many aspects, but he's lacking in this department and I don't know if it's working for me. I love him and don't want to leave him, but I don't know how to move past this aspect of our relationship because I don't think it's something I can deal with forever, if I'm being completely honest with myself. 

Please no judgement, just support and advice. TIA.",It wont change either. I am 52m and my partner 50f went on several dates when we were your age. I planned everything and she just went along. It bothered me a lot but i kind of overlooked it. If i could go back and change things i would. You need to decide if this is a deal breaker or not. It wasnt for me but i often wonder.

dating,143glvx,1686152449.0,"Living with your parents shouldn‚Äôt be frowned upon anymore, in light of how ridiculous the cost of living has become","Minimum wage has barely (and I mean BARELY) increased over the years, despite inflation rising rapidly. If minimum wage kept up with inflation, it would be much higher then it is now. Someone making 40k a year can barley afford to support themselves anymore. I believe this is due to lobbying and corporate greed. My main point, however, is that in the dating/social world, people tend to look down on those who live with their parents in their early-to-mid-20s. With the cost of living being so unbearably high, and wages being kept at (let‚Äôs call it what it is) slave wage, it should no longer be looked down upon.","If someone has their life together and is a well rounded person, I would have zero issue if they were living with their parents.

The key is that they are not living with their parents because they do not have a plan to handle adult life. 

Living with your parents to save a bunch of money every month so your savings was fat is one example. Staying with your parents for a few years after getting a divorce is another understandable reason."

dating,143g4w0,1686151350.0,How do you transition?,"I‚Äôm a 48 year old, divorced male. I was wondering, for those of you who have dated after 40, and even divorce, how did you transition from one phase to the next in your relationships? It seemed easier in our 20s/30s when the natural progression was date-exclusivity-cohabitation-marriage/kids. Now, after 40, when we‚Äôre dating others with kids and/or their own home transitioning to a next phase seems complicated.","If the next level of the relationship escalator after exclusivity has to include cohabitation it‚Äôs probably going to be a lot harder to get there for just the reasons you described.

Personally at this point in my life (divorced 42 with a young child) cohabitation is not even on the table, so the transition to something more serious would have to be measured in other ways."

The second was two weeks later because we both were busy at the time and it was not very good there was not a lot of physical contact aside from a hello and goodbye hug and because it was a double date with a friend and his gf it was a little akward.

We text each other everyday to talk about our days and stuff but I just dont really feel shes interested as much as me.

dating,143dg8c,1686144816.0,"Lack of communication, because of bad first sex. (Sorry for the long story )","Me and my girlfriend know each other for few years but we're together officially for 3 months now. For the whole of the relationship we're long distance, because we live in different cities now. We both want to make it work and have plans moving to the same city in the winter. We try our best to see each other twice per month for couple of days off work. We established a very strong bond and friendship through the years before becoming a couple officially. Everything was going great, we talked on the phone every day for hours, chatted, we told our values (you know the normal stuff), generally enjoying our company and when we see each other we spend the most amazing wonderful time together. 

It all changed about a month ago when she came to visit and we had sex for the first time. We talked about it before we sexted etc. But when it happened I gave her very plain little rough sex. She liked it, but the problem was that she didn't felt emotionally connected with me in that time. It wasn't like OMG it's finally happening with him I cant believe it etc., but it was just an ordinary sex. Because for her the highest form of intimacy is sex and she wanted the first time to be magical, which it wasn't. Maybe all the sexting we did the fact that we saw our bodies beforehand in pictures and the high standards we set for ourselves affected this. 

And since that sex she went very cold. her mood changed the communication stopped. The last 2 days of her visit we didn't talk much at all, she didn't have as much emotion and we didn't do sex again for that stay. When she left we spoke couple times on the phone about the issue and she told me that if she doesn't have sexual attraction to me we're just friends and a relationship cannot be without sex. We promised to do everything we can to fix it, because she fully understands that it's all in her head and we believe  in our relationship and want to make things right. And we did. After 2 weeks I went for a visit in her city and everything went great! We had the most amazing sex very romantic emotional and we felt as one for the first time. Problem solved on both sides happy! 

But one problem remains still and I'm very scared of it. The fact that our communication dropped since the first time we had sex. We started texting less, talked less, didn't know what to say to each other in person as well, awkward silences etc. before we chatted and talked for hours all day about everything laughed, but now it's all gone. We still chat everyday but it's mainly about our day, nothing else.

We spoke yesterday about this and we both don't know why it happens like this, but we agreed that there's a lack of communication and that it started after the bad sex thing.(which is fixed now). She told me that she doesn't want to just talk about our day but to talk to me as a person as a friend like before. Not just the goofy couple talk and how was your day. And for her communication is key in a relationship. I just feel that we went cold and staled. Like we lost our friendship for literally one day. We still care about each other and love each other, but I don't know what to do and how to bring back the communication we had before. It's in each others heads I presume but still don't know how to fix it. Because in this tempo I feel like it might be over soon.",

When im with other guys they seem into me and they always ask me to snap/message/add them. And they say they want to hang out in the future. But often, they don‚Äôt block or ghost me. We could be talking for several weeks and then they‚Äôd suddenly lose interest. Sometimes they reach back out but often it just ends there.

Im so confused. Are guys just like that? Did they ever like me?",

dating,143cm7s,1686142750.0,Waiting for someone to text me back literally shifts my entire personality mood and attitude for the day. Help.,"So. I've been texting back and forth with someone for the past two months. We both have jobs and are very busy but we make the effort to text at least once a day. I dated a lot in college but there was a good period of time (about four years) where I didn't date at all and so going through this process is a bit jarring and is bringing out some ugly traits that I didn't know I had. 

I've never been that much of a good texter - my friends know that I might sometimes take at least three business days to reply, really terrible, I know and I've been trying to actively work on it. Even when it came to dating through apps, I struggled to maintain a conversation and it never really reached past a week's duration. However, when I really like someone, I'm a very prompt and engaged texter. 

This guy that I've been texting isn't the type of person to ask a lot of questions so initially, I thought that he wasn't really that interested. However, he always makes sure to text me at least once a day, even if it's late at night and sometimes we talk several times a day. The issue really isn't his behaviour  - it's more how *I* feel in response to it.

To clarify, we met on Tinder and have yet to actually meet up yet because he's currently going through exams - which yes, I know contributes to the reason why he doesn't answer super promptly - and we intend to actually go on a date after he finishes. 

I know it's irrational, I know there's no real reason to feel the way I do but when he takes a full day to reply, it leaves me feeling gross and down and grumpy. I feel as if he's suddenly not interested. This, of course, changes as soon as he replies. 

This is clarifying to me that I have some type of insecure attachment pattern that I previously wasn't aware of and I need a lot of validation. I've always been confidently comfortable in my own skin and very independent, so this is quite a jarring realisation. 

How can I stop feeling like this? I've tried to keep busy and have constant things to look forward to. I've even tried dating elsewhere. I still am obsessing about getting a reply and checking my phone constantly throughout the day. I know this is a bit of an age-old part of the ritual of dating so if any of you have experienced this, how did you deal with it?","It sounds like you're experiencing what's often referred to as ""favorite person"" syndrome, where one person's actions or lack thereof can drastically impact your mood and sense of self-worth. This can be a challenging thing to handle, especially when entering a new relationship.

You've already made some great strides in identifying your patterns and feelings, so give yourself some credit there! When you notice yourself feeling anxious or down because he hasn't responded, remind yourself that his response time is not a reflection of your worth or how much he's interested. He's shown consistency by contacting you daily, and that's a positive sign. 

Instead of waiting for his messages, it might be helpful to set specific times to check your messages, so you're not constantly anticipating a response. This might also help in reducing the impact of his messages on your overall mood.

It's also important to maintain your own life and interests outside of this interaction. Keeping busy with activities you enjoy, spending time with other people, and maintaining a balance in your life can help mitigate these feelings. 

Ultimately, it's about understanding that a relationship is an addition to your life, not the core of it. If this anxious feeling continues, you may want to consider talking to a mental health professional about strategies to manage this, as it can also be related to issues like anxiety or Borderline Personality Disorder.

Remember, it's okay to need reassurances in a relationship, especially in the early stages. Just make sure to communicate these feelings with your partner in an open, non-confrontational way. If they're right for you, they'll understand and work with you."
dating,143cl14,1686142669.0,Need help replying to a voicenote whilst keeping dignity intact,"I'm at a loss, so I created a throwaway to get some help with this. 

Background - Me and this guy started going on dates back in Feb (we are both in our 30s). At first it was going really well - he seemed interested in me, asked me what I was looking for (I said eventually a long term relationship but with the right person) and his behaviour was consistent. By the 6th date, he became inconsistent and made it known that he wasn't looking for a relationship. I said I wasn't looking for casual, so in what seemed like quite a mature manner, we decided to be friends, however, what I didn't realise was he was thinking FWB. I messaged him stating that its friends with no sex...and obviously he went quiet. I'm not at all shocked - we want different things and it is what it is. However, he sent me a voicenote yesterday and I just don't even know how to respond, if I should at all. The key takeaways are: 

1. Sorry I meant to reply for ages, but basically I forgot. I've even forgotten to message my mum
2. I didn't go quiet because you said no sex but we only met because we were attracted to each other not for friendship
3. I think you're a cool girl, we have similar interests and we can chill but, I'm always going to want to have sex with you but I'm not in a space to spend quality time with you
4. Also I'm not sure how a friendship would work when I barely have time for my current friends, and also like I said it would be tough when I want to have sex with you, so I've been mentally distancing myself from you 
5. But yeah I'm all good - I've booked a trip abroad for 3 months or so, and I'm leaving in July.
6. Ended with a see ya. 

So I'm not an idiot - I know he has no interest in me as a human, and clearly would only want to see me if I'm down to have sex. But honestly, I'm just irritated (and a little hurt) with the disrespect of him waving the idea of casual when I have said no and reducing me down to a sexual object, when at some point we were enjoying each other's company without sex. The leaving for 3 months thing was just the cherry on top, but, I have no intention of seeing him before he leaves or staying in contact - what is the best way to reply without sounding bitter and having some dignity about it! 

Thank you Reddit for the help!","I just find it interesting how a guy like that can say he has no time for his mum or for his friends and yet seems to have time to waste on trying to convince a girl who isn‚Äôt interested in having sex with him to do just that. And I‚Äôm sure if he managed to succeed he would probably manage (against the odds it seems /s) to find time to have sex with you.

He‚Äôs not really worth your time OP. I don‚Äôt even think you have to dignify him a response. You‚Äôve set very clear boundaries and he continues to try to skirt around them. Clearly he doesn‚Äôt respect you very much."

If we go places it feels like a distance between us. 
Found he ask a girl out back in April. Flirting calling her beautiful and really doting over her. Wanting to know her hobbies, her everything. He tells her when she messages it makes him so happy! He looked up places to take her star gazing and other fun places. She stood him up of course. I‚Äôm pretty sure if I mention I know about it, he would call me a liar and say I have no proof and I‚Äôm his one and only.

dating,1439se5,1686134780.0,Can someone help me understand what is going on?,"I (21M) met a girl (21F) online and talked for couple of days and decided to meetup. The first date was really good, we had a good time and it ended up us staying the night in hotel. During the time we were having sex, she'd stop randomly and push me away and say stuff like ""You're going to block me after this aren't you?"" or ""You just want a quick fuck"" and stuff like that. But, she was the one who offered to go to hotel and do whatever we were doing. I assured her that I wasn't like that. The sex was amazing, probably the best I ever had in my short life, and I ended up finishing in her after she told me to. We slept, got out of the hotel in the morning and got some breakfast and I took her home.
Afterwards, we texted here and there. We both worked a lot so it wasn't very constant. She was very excited to come to my place this week, which is almost hour and a half away. I was very excited too, it was planned and everything and suddenly she just stopped talking to me. The thing that doesn't make sense is, she never gave me the impression that she doesn't like me. She was very into me, online or offline, and that drawn me to her a lot. We are on the same wavelength, and I fall for people who shows affection to me very easily. Even the last text she sent was to make sure I ate or not, but after that she vanished. She unfollowed me on Instagram, and didn't see my text at all. I sent her a follow-up text a day later, but no response. I sent her a text directly, but no response. I know she has been active, but it doesn't make sense to me that why she'd do it. I have never been ghosted before, and tbh it kind of hurts because we really got on well together. What is actually going on?

I kinda see a bunch of red flags there but I am not sure 100%. Should I end the conversation?",I also see red flags.  Lots and lots of red flags.   I mean you can try telling him that he‚Äôs coming on too strong if you think he‚Äôs worth a second shot.
dating,1438prx,1686131175.0,Thoughts,"This is way too late probably but a few months ago I went to urgent care and a nurse practitioner came to see me. When I looked into her eyes, I felt distinct electricity and it‚Äôs super rare for me to feel that. It was kind of weird because I could only see her eyes because of the mask. I‚Äôve gone on so many first dates these past few years and felt nothing. 

Since I was sick and because she was taking care of me as an NP, I didn‚Äôt do anything about it. I feel it‚Äôs inappropriate to ask someone out who is taking care of you for their job, like a waitress, etc. Do you think that was the right call? Or should I have tried to message her afterwards to see if she felt electricity too? Is it too late to message her because too much time have passed (3 months ago)?","If a ‚Äúcustomer‚Äù or patient asked me out when I was working I might feel awkward or like I can‚Äôt say yes because I‚Äôm on the job. Also do you think because she was in a caretaking role that increased your attraction? And she may not be what you are expecting since she was wearing a mask. 

That said, shoot your shot! You are still thinking about her! Maybe you could eat at the hospital cafeteria and run into her? It would be easier to say yes if I was on break or lunch. But you also don‚Äôt want to look like a stalker so be careful about that. You should‚Äôve asked her, ‚ÄúAre you single?‚Äù when you were gazing into each other‚Äôs eyes. Next time go for it!"
dating,1438foi,1686130193.0,From rejected to dating a model,"Long story short: I was perusing (chasing) a girl for a long period of time. (One year) I dated her once and get rejected aftwerwards. Over the year I developed feelings for her. I respected her wish and asked her to block me for my mental health. She was not the prettiest but she was a shy girl and I like that. Many of my friends said long before I began chasing her that she's is not worth it and by looks she's ""not on my level"". I was always hating it because I am not that superficial. 

After I gave up and a colleague of said that she has a friend who is would be compatible to me. (because we share the same heritage, home country, Religion etc.)
I asked her to show me her picture and I was BOOM. She's the most beautiful girl I have ever dated or will I date in my life time. This is the true maximum. 

I have dated her once, she's nice and so but I didn't feel the spark. 

Is this because I am still hanging on the girl who I only met once and she has rejected me? 

She's a model and charming, lovely, taller than me, she pays for my meal it feels like a dream. Two months ago I was sad (not cyring or so) and now I am running through downtown. Random people are approaching her and giving her (and me) compliments. One time a muscular guy came up towards us and shaked my hand for having a beautiful girl! 

Everybody is saying I am doing the biggest mistake if I am not marrying her. We have a lot in common bc we are both from the same country ( although we both are born here in Switzerland) 

What should I do","It would be stupid to date a new girl just because she got all those qualities and seems like a match on paper while you don't have the actual feelings for her. I mean, it won't work in the long run and you'll end up hurting her or atleast just wasting her time which she doesn't seem to deserve.

On the flip side, the other girl isn't interested in you, so you'll need to find a way to move on from her.....but till that happens, i'd suggest not dating anyone.

So, basically, stop chasing the one who's not interested and stop getting deeper into a connection that you don't feel to be suitable for you."
dating,14385kr,1686129165.0,Should I give him a chance? Or am I his second choice?,"Me and a guy slept together earlier this year. We didn't date seriously and we didn't know each other that well, as in we only flirted and talked superficially, but there was strong efforts from both sides, so I thought we were both interested in each other. I wasn't sure what I wanted, so I gave him mixed signals, and ignored him one time by looking at him and then looking away. After that, we didn't talk for a month after this, which is obviously my fault.

Anyway, I eventually talk to him, and he still seemed receptive to my flirting, and he subtly flirted back. However, he didn't approach me anymore and seemed more distant. I thought this was because he wanted me to chase him, but after 1 month of this, I found out he's exclusive with someone else.

I confront him, and he makes it clear he's exclusive with her now, but that she will leave soon, because she's an exchange student, so he's unsure how the relationship will turn out. I tell him I feel like he kept me around, because he wanted to be with her until she leaves, and then me afterwards.

Three months later, when they ended, he says he wants to give us another chance. He told me that I gave him mixed signals, and that we didn't talk for 1 month, so he chose someone who seemed more into him. And that by time time, I showed him interest, they were already a thing. Additionally, he said we didn't know each other that well, but that he spent a lot of time with her, because they lived in the same student dorm, but that he wanted to get to know me properly now.

To be fair, we didn't know each other that well. We mostly flirted and talked superficially, so I think it's possible he considers me another choice, rather than his second choice.

Should I give him a chance? Or am I his second choice?","You're his second choice.

Otherwise he would have pressed to date you seriously in the beginning despite the mixed signals. And otherwise he would have ended things very soon with the exchange student instead of continuing with it the entire time."

During the relationship, I could've given more to him, but it was a really busy time for me. However, when I was with him, I was very present. Anyways, things ended and it broke me in ways I didn't even see coming. I didn't realize how much I started to like him and when things ended abruptly, it sent me down a dark hole.

Things didn't end badly or anything. He just didn't like me and that's that. He was honestly such a good guy that there were no red flags or icks for me, which makes it so damn hard to move on. It's been months and I can't stop thinking about him. I miss him. I found out he's seeing someone now, so I know for sure that he's not even thinking about me. It just sucks how I feel so much for him, but I know he never felt that way about me. He is unbothered by this whole situation while I've been kind of at my lowest these past few months. I know 2 months wasn't a long time, but I don't know why I feel so much for him. I just want to let him go. Why does it have to be like this? I have done so much reflection on the whole situation and while I know the reasons why this is affecting me the way that it has, my heart still hurts and I'm exhausted.

TL;DR I was dating a guy for some time and he ended things. There were no hard feelings, he was just no longer interested in me. I do wish him the best, but it just sucks knowing that he's doing just fine without me while I'm over here struggling.

Update: I recognize that since it ended so early, it ended when things were in the honeymoon stage which is always hard because I'm mourning the potential. There's still a lot about him that I don't know, but I guess I never got to see things through and I wanted more time with him. I call him a good guy because he was a good guy. I didn't like him just because he was a good guy. I liked him for who he was. I wanted to continue to get to know him more and he didn't. I didn't think this post was going to blow up as much as it did, so thanks for the help!","Been there. I allowed myself to cry and wallow and grieve and then went and immersed myself into a new hobby. It is truly awful and still hurts sometimes but yeah.

dating,14370yg,1686125010.0,What should I do with my situationship?,"Disclaimer: This is my first long post on Reddit so it‚Äôs going to be awful and scattered. Sorry. 

I (24m) have been ‚Äúseeing‚Äù my‚Ä¶ friend? (36f) since the beginning of February of this year and it started as a FWB. We‚Äôve slept together 1-3 times every week since then and as it‚Äôs progressed I‚Äôve found myself staying at her house for 2-4 days a time every week and we‚Äôd do things with each others families and friends. While I‚Äôm at her house we‚Äôll cook for each other, clean, smoke pot and/or watch tv. I first met her parents when she invited me to a hockey game with her sister, BIL, niece, mom and dad. And from there she‚Äôd invite me to hang out with her and her best friend on a trip to the town over to go shopping or eat. We‚Äôd also do this just me and her from time to time. She also bartended for my birthday in April. Anyways, we‚Äôve never labeled anything and I‚Äôm stuck with feelings. We‚Äôve talked about what we are and what we want a few times and left it at this non boundary situationship. Her family gives her shit for the age gap and that bothers her and my family gives us both shit because they think we are actually dating and that she‚Äôs fucking around on me when in reality we have no labels so it doesn‚Äôt matter. Don‚Äôt know if this is important but I‚Äôm pretty sure she hasn‚Äôt been fucking anyone else because I‚Äôm the one that‚Äôs always with her at the bar every weekend and at her house 2-4 days out of the week. But anyways all of this bothers her and she says she‚Äôs wasn‚Äôt looking for a relationship when we started our fling but she‚Äôs been treating it like one and she‚Äôs told me that she‚Äôs thought about it and we‚Äôd go on these little dates to test me but she‚Äôs afraid of the age gap and she doesn‚Äôt want to string me along or want me waiting for her to be ready for a relationship. There have also been times when we‚Äôre both drunk she‚Äôll tell me that she wishes I‚Äôd wait, or that she loves me. And will have me come over very early in the morning to take care of her while she‚Äôs drunk, sick or hurt. 

Backstory: I was in a 6 year long term relationship with my high school sweetheart. This ended with her cheating on me with one of her ‚Äúfriends‚Äù last August. I couldn‚Äôt eat and was severely depressed for a month and a half. Ended up losing 15 pounds in a week from it. But I met (36f) shortly after and we slept together once in October and would just see each other around at bars until we hooked back up in February. 

(36f) was in a 10 year marriage and ended with her ex husband cheating on her. She claims he was abusive and popped pills and got progressively worse. After her divorce, a year and a half before she met me, she hooked up with my cousin, which he‚Äôs a real piece of shit just from seeing him around family stuff. And they didn‚Äôt work out. She then tried it out a year later? In September, a month before we first hooked up, with this bigger dude a few towns over for a month and I guess he‚Äôs manipulative, and then she fell for this other guy last December, a month before we started hooking up, but he got some other woman pregnant. So she‚Äôs‚Ä¶ promiscuous and would sleep around but would hold off when she‚Äôs talking to someone? So all of her previous interests lasted a month to 2 months while this has lasted 3-4. As we both were still sleeping around with other random people the first month we were sleeping together.

(Sigh) anyways, regardless of the mess this whole situation is she‚Äôs stressed out with the ridicule from friends and family, and she doesn‚Äôt want a relationship right now. We both enjoy the company and the sex but I want more and have feelings for her. She has feelings but won‚Äôt commit and wants to either end things for my benefit or establish boundaries and be FWB. I don‚Äôt want to let go because of the hope that things could transpire but I also know better. It also hurts to imagine her sleeping with other people whether we downgrade back to fwb or end it all together. 

Just want to know what everyone else would do and if there‚Äôs even the slightest bit of chance for it to ever become a relationship. And I know I‚Äôm an idiot so there‚Äôs no need to restate it and I know what‚Äôs best for me but the weekly sex is pretty great. I just need to hear it from other people‚Äôs perspective and if you all think I should Play the long game and end up potentially hurting myself while waiting for her, go for the fwb but attempt to move on or be smart and end it. I just don‚Äôt want to go back to being depressed for a whole month again like I did after my ex and also lose the chance at something more with her, as well as lose the benefits of weekly sex.","Leave it alone. Leave her and have some respect for yourself, you can get amazing sex anywhere. You sound like.. a nice guy like a woman pleaser and that‚Äôs not a bad thing but dont let her play you. As a woman myself (25F) I feel like I‚Äôve been in this boat with men that are clearly into me, we‚Äôre hooking up and I‚Äôm giving vague answers to their commitment questions. It‚Äôs cause I don‚Äôt see myself really being with them but I like the attention and honestly I was lonely looking back. The warm body was nice. But not lonely enough to commit to those FWB cause I knew I wanted better than them. Move forward man keep your head up"

This man is confused, it can happens to any of us.   
You probably don't want to invest too much in him for now. Find someone else.

If it's meant to happen, you guys might eventually reconnect sometime later in your life, after he's sorted through his feelings and is no longer focused on his studies.

dating,14364tu,1686121710.0,"I really like my new beau, how do I keep from messing it up?"," My last 2 relationships were very abusive, so I've been really cautious with dating. I've been going to therapy and have been doing a lot of good work. I would say I have worked through the worst of it, but there are some residual insecurities that creep up and its at the forefront of my mind with dating. 


I met this guy back in April and we took things really slow to start. Honestly, I'm surprised he stuck around because I've been unintentionally kind of aloof and just awkward all over. Everything about this is new to me and im likely overthinking everything. Despite this, he seemed genuinely interested in me, and I really appreciate how he respected my boundaries by not pushing for a kiss or anything. We did eventually kiss after 5 dates.



 We've had some really fun dates and deep conversations and since our first kiss, we've had lots more and the sex has been wild. He's obsessed with me and my body and compliments me all the time. He notices the little things and goes out of his way to make sure I'm comfortable and always wants to be close to me. I am not used to this AT ALL.  It all makes me very happy and excited but also really sweaty. Like I need to shower and throw my clothes in the dryer kind of sweaty. 



Our texting habits are pretty mild. We'll say good morning and good night and check in a couple times in between. But i dont feel anxious when i dont hear from him. Also our work schedules make it hard to meet often, which, for me, is a good thing to keep things going slow and steady. We're meeting this weekend for an overnight in the mountains. 


 He's honest, kind, funny, community and family oriented, active and social. Also, old folks LOVE him, he will chat with the lonely old guy at the racetrack  or the older woman sitting alone like its normal, massive green flag. He's literally everything I ever wanted. 

 
I'm so scared of doing this wrong and losing a good person, but I'm also afraid that he'll surprise me and end up like the others. But then I hate that I'm projecting my past relationships on this, but I need to be careful. 

How do I keep from fucking this up?","I‚Äôm sorry but it doesn‚Äôt sound like things are slow and steady if you‚Äôre having wild sex. Sex really does something to the mind. The way to see if he‚Äôs right is by asking hard hitting questions, see if your values align. Red flags always start small, look at his vices, how does he speak to you when he disagrees with you. Usually men are perfect the until they get comfy. There will be some signs like he‚Äôll be upset you won‚Äôt drop an important activity for him, or you‚Äôre always on his timeline. Those are red flags to controlling behavior in my experience."
dating,1435zre,1686121244.0,"Can we stop ghosting for the love of God? Please, if you're not interested just say so","I've been single going on 6 years now. I've just had very little desire to get out there, I'm a super introverted person.  In the past 5 years I can literally count on both hands the number of girls off dating hands I've had actual conversations with. Not just a bit of small talkk for a day or two, but actual conversations. 
I get bored of the apps very quickly so I'll swpe a few times and then just forget for so long my accounts get shut down. Like I said, not much interest in getting out there and I rarely get matches so I just kinda feel meh on everything

Just moved 2600 miles across the country. I've no friends our here, no family. Just me and my dog. 
Decided to try the apps again. 

3 weeks ago I met a girl, she messaged me first(an actual first), and is one of the first few times a woman my age has straight up called me atteactive. And out of the very few women I've had actual conversations with, she's the only one I didnt have to pull teeth to get to talk.  We are borderline the same person, we like the same movies, tv shows, video games, hell we found out 2 days after talking to each other we were both at a heavy metal concert 3 days before she messaged me. 

We went out 2 times and had plans for a third date on Saturday. Unfortunately her babysitter flaked on her so we canceled. I told her it was okay, i get she has kids and i am 100% on board with her kids being her priority. SHE then asked me out for breakfast, i said I was free Tuesday and would love to. She said we could discuss plans the next day as she had to make her kids dinner. I said okay. 
She thanked me again for being understanding about her kids and said most guys get completely mad and just ghost her after an issue with her kids or try and make her feel bad. That It was refreshing that I was different and understanding. 

It's been over 3 days now, and she's not messaged me back at all. And since blocked Me on the app we met on. I'm certain she blocked my number as well because I tried calling once and it just rings. I've only sent her 3 texts since and all were along the lines of ""Hey, hope things are good. We still on for Tuesday?""

Like okay, if you lose interest just fucking say something. I'd rather that than just straight up being ghosted. First person in years I've been excited to talk to and stuff and this happens. 
Now I've got sisters, so I've heard horror stories about when they told guys they weren't interested so like to an extent I get it, but i don't think I ever gsve her any indication I'd be like that. I was always respectful, and decent, something she said was a huge difference in the men she normally talked to from the apps. I was the first person in a while to not treat or talk to her like she was just a piece of meat. Or treat her differently when she said she has kids. 
So I am just confused cause I thought we were getting along really well. And now my introverted, majorly depressed ass just feels like shutting down again and going back to not caring.","Same thing happend to me... But in my case she didn't have kids everything was going smoothly we went on dates (only 2) and we both had soo many things in common, we worked on the same field...it was going smooth and right after our 2nd date she started ghosting my text... I tried contacting her several times but she never responded to any of my text... After 6 months I am getting job request from her asking me to work in her start up."

dating,1434wkj,1686117463.0,"How to actually navigate a bar? I've been going probably every few days (don't drink except on weekends, usually order food) for the past 10-ish years. I've never managed to have an actual conversation with any women, even with help from people.","Here's an example of what happened tonight, this isn't too uncommon.


I'm sitting at the bar and multiple women come up to hit on the bartender (we hang out sometimes) because well he's attractive. And he was talking to me before they were hitting on him. So he tries to tell them ""but have you met my friend [name]?"" and they'll ignore the comment entirely once he points to me. If they're more drunk they will ask in a confused way why they would want to meet me. Although I think that's mostly the more mean people. 


I actually told the bartender I was having problems talking to women and they didn't seem to like me and he told me he'd help me out, so that's why he tried to basically funnel people to me but they were the exact opposite of interested. One of them even got kind of pissed and said ""I want to talk to youuuuu not him"" in a really aggravated voice when he told them to talk to me while he gets someone else's drink. 


Sometimes I'll try to sit next to someone and talk but that gets me in trouble too. One time someone sat 2 seats down from me and I asked her what drink she got and she told me she was just trying to drink not talk to anyone. Then someone else came up to her and started talking and they had a good conversation. I had to go to the bathroom and she was actually there (I didn't realize she had gotten up) and I saw her in the line. She cut the line by telling the two guys  in front that she didn't want me behind her and to please stick there when she leaves so she went in and then they yelled at me to use the restroom ahead of them once someone came out.  I obviously did something to scare her but the only thing I ever said to her was asking her what her drink was, and then I went back to my phone and didn't look at her again until we ran into each other in the restroom.


I'd say a few times I've had people sit next to me and ask me to move. Again these are usually more drunk people who say shit like wanting someone they actually want to talk to next to them.


I have had conversations with men. I often just sit there and listen to something (airpod in one ear) or browse my phone and sometimes other men will sometimes talk to me and I respond but never if they're with someone, only if they're solo. If I initiate a conversation with a guy it usually goes well. I just say hi and ask what they're drinking and then it flows from there. I do the same thing to women and they seem to shut down immediately but I'm not doing anything different. 

I'd say my average night out consists of trying and failing to start conversations with anywhere from 3-5 women (I'm not getting up and walking around going up to random women, people who sit near me, I just sit there a long time)  and then having a longer conversation with a dude about some esoteric topic. Usually the first guy I try to talk to turns into a very long form conversation. Tonight I had a conversation with someone who was from the Tigray region of Ethiopia and we discussed the genocide there for example. 


This has been going on for literally a decade, I can't say I've ever actually had a full conversation with a woman where I got her name, profession, where they're from, etc. Despite trying.","I can clearly see your problem. You don't want to talk to women the same way you talk to men.

While what I talk about with women has a wide range. Typically I am trying to make them laugh or to convey personal emotions towards them. Regardless of my intentions.

Keep the esoteric topics for the guys you are meeting at the bar."
dating,1434tvu,1686117204.0,I don't see myself being with someone because I don't think will like me for me. Do you think everyone is meant to be with someone ?,"I have been in some relationship not a lot but maybe around 2. I know it is not a lot. Now everytime I imagine myself being with someone or getting married, I can't wrap my head around it because I dont think they will like me.

Those relationship it was always them who doesn't want me and not the other way around. They are mature people and there was no cheating or arguments. They just didn't like me in the end. It was my personality that they keep saying and just didn't feel a connection. I keep asking myself if there was nothing bad I did and it was just my personality they didn't feel a connection or like, why else would they leave. They lasted not very long about 3 months to 1 year. It would start great but end bad in the end. There must be something wrong with me right ? Given all those facts, I just don't seee anyone with me in the long-term because it would start great but would end and most of their reason is me. Either they didn't feel a connection or they don't like my personality.

I have learned from the 1 year relationship. But the 3 month date that I had made me realize that the connection I had with her was there at first but it didn't workout. She said it herself. 

So now I am in this mindset that I will never meet anyone that will truly have a connection with me because it is always they who don't like me and not me.

Given that do you think even those people who think they will never find someone to connect with will find and meant to be with someone ?",

The best you can do at this point is try to open up the conversation with her about what's causing this drop in sex drive. Obviously it's not okay to demand sex from her but it is OK to state your sexual needs in a relationship. Make sure the conversation isn't just framed around sex. So for example instead of saying ""Hey, we're having less sex and I don't like that, what can we do?"" Say ""I've noticed that sex has become less frequent and this is putting a strain on me. I am also concerned about what might be causing this for you and I think we should talk about anything that might be causing this low drive for you. I'd like to work through this together."" The key point being the word ""together"". Yes you should put work in but so should she. This isn't you vs her. It's you and her vs the problem.

That being said, if she can't/won't open up about this and refuses to address the issue, or perhaps doesnt even see your mismatched libidos as an issue, then you should leave. Sexual incompatibility will always tank a relationship."

dating,1433rb6,1686113735.0,Dating as a Disabled Person... Is Hard [Let Me Explain],"At the risk of starting nothing more than a pity party, dating as a wheelchair user, and just in general for me, is hard: I feel like I don't have much to offer when it comes to romantic relationships. Let me explain.

I am a 26-year-old dude who, due to a congenital birth defect, is not able-passing and uses an electric wheelchair most of the time to get around. Growing up, I've been on a few first and second dates, though nothing came about from any of them, and last year I had my first long-term, committed relationship with a fellow wheelchair user. However, due to both of us having unpacked emotional baggage that collectively made the relationship less than healthy, I choose to end it after 8 months.

All of that being said, outside of that relationship, whenever I've (on the rare occassion) casually dated, or have had someone interested in me or have been interested in someone, I find that such a potential relationship really is just a pipe dream for me. Usually the interest starts things off on the right foot, but then the reality quickly sets in: can't go to their favorite places for dates because of a lack of accessibility, more nights in than they would like because the wheelchair needs repairs or recharged, traveling and outdoor activities become much harder to engage in or enjoy due to wheelchair concerns, etc. I am just so tired of seeing the interest drain out of a prospective partner's eyes because they realize they can't live the life they want with me.

For others, the task of convincing them that they will be a partner and not just some kinky au pair for another manchild with a different-than-normal excuse for needing to be mothered or taken care of becomes so great that I might as well not even try.

Lastly, because my parents growing up weren't very good parents (neglectful, suffocating, controlling, and sometimes downright abusive), I didn't really grow up normally. That is to say, I didn't ever really grow up with a sense that I was lovable or with the appropriate opportunities to develop normal social skills. Consequently, I am terrified of being vulnerable in close relationships. Up until recently, I didn't really know what I liked and disliked and what my needs are because, well, for the vast majority of my life, I wasn't allowed to be my own person. All of this is to say, I am just as crippled psychologically as I am physically. I do go to therapy and do what I can to better myself.

TL;DR: I want to be a part of a romantic relationship, but what I truly have to offer pales in comparison to anybody else (at least to me). I know dating is hard, but why does it have to be this hard","Dude I am sorry, if I could give you a big bro hug I would.

Im sorry your parents werent the greatest either. Although you have been through a lot it seems like you have a good head on your shoulders.
Continue therapy of course.
And yes the dating world is fucked from what people are saying.
I would never give up though, check out squirmy and grubs on youtube the guy bagged a 9/10. There is someone out there for all of us, we just have to keep looking and sifting through the garbage until we finally find her. 
I wish I could give you some awesome words of wisdom but all I can say is keeping improving, keep going to therapy, although you may be limited physically you have to take advantage of what you do have, which is your mind. Like a bodybuilder lifting weights to grow his muscles, you need to do the same with your mind.
I wish you nothing but the best brother."
dating,1433jhz,1686113061.0,Reassurance that this could be really great?,"Male, 25, straight 

Okay so about a year and a half ago, maybe a bit more, I was asked by someone I know through my job if I was single. I do animal control, and this was asked at the vet that I use. This person was asking for one of the girls that work up front in the lobby. Now, at that time, I was very much not single, but engaged. Fast forward a bit from there, to last June where the fianc√© and I moved, for me to VERY quickly learn she had recently cheated on me. Engagement ends. I come back home and get my old job back thankfully a couple months later. So of course, I‚Äôm single now, and dying to know which girl it was that wanted to know I was single. At some point I kind of get confirmation of who, but they had since gotten into a relationship with a partner. So, about three months ago, I slide up on this person story and we get into a really good convo about what it‚Äôs like being 25 and feeling stuck and all that mumbo jumbo. But then she kept asking questions, kept the conversation going even over the next couple of days. And I would say since then we have talked almost every single day. Now yes she‚Äôd been in a relationship this whole time. But our convos were never and still have never been romantic/inappropriate in any way. Strictly platonic. I‚Äôd even hung out with both of them together a couple of times. That said, there was a point she mentioned her and her partner having issues and almost breaking up not super long ago, and it had also been made as clear as it could be without actually saying it that she was in fact the girl asking if I was single all that time ago. Now, keep in mind I was cheated on and been single for a year now, doing my thing for the first time in my life it feels like. Over the last few months of consistently talking to this girl and a couple of hangouts as part of a group I‚Äôve come to really like her as a person and friend, but also romantically interested, which is a confirmed mutual feeling. So, her and her partner broke up about a week and a half ago, just waiting on them to be able to move out when they can (they are non binary and it was a fairly mutual breakup). So now we are talking more every day but it‚Äôs still mostly platonic. I know she hasn‚Äôt had much time single and I think needs that time same as I did over the past year. But the point of all this is that in my gut this feels like something that could turn out really great in the long run and totally different from how my last relationship/failed engagement started. We have similar upbringings (as in like bad home life/overcoming generational trauma) and this is among many other things we have in common. I‚Äôm just so scared I‚Äôm gonna mess it up. Or that I‚Äôll wait as long as she needs to find out she doesn‚Äôt want to be with me romantically, get friendzoned or something. Idk what you fine people think?",

I was assaulted a lot as a kid/teenager and then all of this happened when I was 18:  
  
\-- 1. FWB would randomly take the condom off in the dark without notice. Or he would put it in my ass when i was too high to really respond, but eventually took it out when i told him to.  
  
\--2. Dude I was hooking up with regularly called me stupid. He held my legs down and made me have sex without a condom. Then he cuddled with me after. He told me he r@ped me and smiled. the next few days he was really paranoid i would go to the police. he got more sexually vanilla and i got mad at him about this and insulted his manhood. I was a mess idk.  
  
\--3/ Dude took off condom intentionally and finished in me without warning, then stalked me for a bit because we 'connected' so much.  
  
\--4. i went to guy's house and he was much uglier in person. I told him previously about bad sexual experiences in a vague way. He's insistent about making out with me immediately and making me get on my knees to blow him. He returns the favor and it wasn't unenjoyable but he grossed me out in general. Guy becomes obsessed with me and also wouldnt leave me alone. i dont think about this a lot but i think its gross  
  
5. im rly high and dont know who i am. i have unprotected creampie sex with a guy while im at least partially passed out. but he did check in with me a lot. we begin dating. He gets obsessive and jealous. He would threaten to hit/rape me if she didn't have sex with him (in a calm voice). He'd also tell me how worthless i was when we cuddled together. But sometimes he'd also be caring and understanding if i didnt want sex. He got very mad at me (we both cheated on each other) and inflicted pain leading to me crying and getting a migraine, then left and cut off contact with me. Though ,he did try to reconnect many times. in the months after this I thought everything I said was so stupid and wrong I barely spoke

dating,143360q,1686111874.0,How do I move on after 10 years?,"I dated someone 10 years ago then again 3 years ago. We broke up the first time because we were young, we both had some unresolved issues from our childhood, and I don‚Äôt think we realized what we had when we had it. We got back together 3 years ago and things were amazing. We had talks about how we both had missed eachother after all this time and we had so much fun and it was like we were best friends again. Unfortunately, I lived 3 hours away and he had just gotten a job working 6 hours away for weeks on and 2 weeks off. There was virtually no way we‚Äôd ever see eachother as I travel for work also. I have compared every man to him for the past ten years. I still love him to this day. I have now moved back to the town that he lives in and we live within a mile of eachother. I wanted to reach out but found out he is seeing someone else. 

I have 3 separate questions here:

1. Has anyone ever gotten back together after years apart and it worked out for them? Is right person, wrong timing really possible? 

2. If you don‚Äôt believe we‚Äôd ever get back together, how do I find closure here? I can‚Äôt seem to move on or stop missing him. What have you done to find closure without actually having a conversation with that person and coming to a mutual agreement?

3. Is anyone experiencing a similar situation? (Breaking up with someone and not being able to move on for several years) I have been on dates and put myself out there and I just have this feeling that he really was the one. Sometimes I feel like I‚Äôm crazy that I still miss him.","You are perfectly normal, in this and any other situation never give up on something dear and irreplaceable.

Reach out to him as a friend, ask how is he and perhaps a spark will rekindle or not. 

You will not be doing anything wrong.

One way or another you will get closure from his reaction. Without contacting him you will forever think about it and wonder what would have happened if?"

If you aren't feeling it, politely say so and move past it and treat it as a learning experience.

If you do feel a connection of some sort, proceed with caution. If you don't have anyone in your life that can coach you about say age gap dating like this, then it's better to be extra cautious. The difference in age may lead to areas of your future interactions where there will be a absolute disconnect. Such as life goals, beliefs, differences in long term and short term goals/desires.

Just make sure that whatever you do that it's consensual, mutually respectful, and are able to communicate as well as willingly cooperate to the best of each other's ability. If you can't meet that criteria I'd suggest moving on. Hope this helps."

dating,14318g2,1686106143.0,Completely confused after amazing two dates,"Joined hinge after a very long old relationship (last 2 years married - finalised the divorce about 3 months ago). Matched with this guy and then we set up a date to meet in the park. He also mentioned that he was getting out of a long term relationship. We connected very well on common interests, the conversation was very free flowing - the date felt almost surreal. He drove me around for a bit and offered to drop me home. He was respectful and asked if he could hold my hands and if he could kiss me at the end of the first date. We kissed - it was great and he texted after.

We set up another date at his place where he suggested we cook together. He was responsive and sweet in his texts leading up to the meeting. The second date went very well - we cooked a great meal, listened to music, I bonded with his cat, had amazing sex ( I thought so at least because we went at it twice). He tends to have a busy schedule so looked tired - we were also drunk and high - and he mentioned how I should be getting back as he needed to drive home the next day early in the morning. I was a bit taken aback an said it was fine and left shortly. The goodbye wasn‚Äôt too great.

The next morning I told him what a great night I had but also mentioned that I would have liked him to be upfront about the boundaries he has so I can plan better - like getting home late at night when I‚Äôm drunk and high. He respectfully acknowledged it. I decided to keep the conversation going. The next day I asked him if he would like to go watch a movie next week but he said was too busy this week and would probably be free the week after. I wished him luck for the week ahead and our text chain ended at him wishing me the same.

I felt very lucky to meet him - had a wonderful time on both our dates but now I‚Äôm quite confused. I‚Äôm not sure where we stand am afraid to take another step forward. We both had agreed that we wanted something short term at the moment but I don‚Äôt quite know what it means.

My intuition is telling me that he wasn‚Äôt just using me for sex given the depth of our conversation. Looking for an outside perspective to understand what to do next",Welcome to 2023 dating world.

Just be a good guy that makes a effort to enjoy life while keeping in shape and making money. Strictly speaking it's a numbers game, don't treat women as the goal.

Many guys who only want a casual relationship won‚Äôt take the next step when you are basically acting like his girlfriend without the label.

dating,142z71r,1686100488.0,"Am I texting ""wrong""?","I (22F) started talking to a guy (26M) from Hinge about 2 weeks ago. He got my number from Hinge and started texting me every second of his day, no exaggeration at all. At first I was a little taken back, but I was too preoccupied/busy to think too much into it. I don't really like to text that much, but again, I just answered when I could and didn't think about it. He was away for Memorial Day weekend with his entire friend group and still proceeded to text me every second of every day.

After the weekend, I ended up increasing my texting time by a lot. Just for reference, my phone alerted me my screen time was up 159% (lol). I kinda started to get attached; I was staying up way later just to text him. 

We met in person this past Friday and somewhat hit it off. He seemed really into me, but I didn't 100% see myself with him quite yet; I wanted to go on another date at least to see though. 

He assured me at the end of the date he wanted to see me again. However, the next day he didn't text me at all. I'm used to at least a follow up/""did you get home safe"" from guys who like me and want to see me again, especially considering his behavior before. I kinda took this to mean maybe he didn't actually like me and that I should move on, so I kept to myself.

Sunday rolls around and he invites me over around 9PM (after still not texting me all Saturday and for the day on Sunday). Since it's so late, I tell him I'll come over but just make my intentions to not hookup clear. He says he wouldn't be opposed to hooking up, but also didn't expect it, so he still wanted me to come.

We watch a movie and have some good talks and I head home around midnight. Again, he does not text me at all after. This time, I walked home alone and really expected a ""get home safe?"" text. 

Finally, today (Tuesday), I try to talk to him. I tell him that I don't get the sense that he likes me because his behavior has rapidly changed after he has met me in person. I give him space to explain himself, expecting answers from anywhere to that he doesn't like me and was afraid to bring it up, to maybe feeling more comfortable now that we were seeing each other in person and didn't feel the need to text anymore. I didn't really have a set answer I wanted, I just wanted an explanation as to what has changed. 

Instead, he flips it on me and says I shouldn't expect constant communication and that I should look elsewhere. He brought up his past ""successful"" relationships with girls who didn't need to be texted all the time. This comment kind of sat with me wrong, but regardless, I explained that it wasn't so much about the texting; I told him if anything, I'd prefer to text less than we did before, but I just wanted to know his intentions based on his changing behavior.
 
All and all, I'm really frustrated about the texting situation. I feel like I did something wrong. Was I wrong to bring it up so soon, or should I have just expressed boundaries early on that I did not feel the need to text so much to prevent this situation? I'm extremely new to dating, so this situation has just left me confused. I don't want to put all the blame on the guy, so I'm wondering what I might have done wrong here, or if it was just a case of us not being compatible. Aside from this situation, I already got the sense we might not be fully compatible, so it's not a huge loss overall. I more so want to know what can I learn here for the future. Thank you!","I'm not saying leave the guy since everything so far has been cool (by what I'm getting from your story) but that is a red flag. While yes, couples don't need to text all day everyday (I believe that it kind of dulls the relationship sometimes unless it's the right person) but to play defense on such a simple question is kind of concerning. And to bring up past relationships for said simple questions, as if comparing you.....idk, as a guy myself, that's weird"

Even if those girls aren't into it, they might have friends or you could get invited to events etc. Or get a part time job, join a rec sports team etc.  Same basic formula is basically how social life works generally. Once you are out of high school, you have to be much more intentional about building relationships, romantic or otherwise, because the infrastructure for friendship (spending a lot of time with people who share similar interests or life circumstances) isn't mandated by law.

dating,142xlk6,1686096074.0,Wouldn't it be better to have sex early on rather than wait months?,"TO BE CLEAR, I AM NOT SHAMING ANYONE FOR THERE OWN DECISIONS ON ANYTHING! 

This post stems from a post I just saw in a different thread, and got my curious. Basically, a married woman who is unhappy sexually because her husband is very vanilla while she is not. Otherwise, the marriage is great. 

I know this is incredibly dependent on a lot of factors but, sexual compatibility IS important in a relationship - any type of relationship. It can make or break one very easily too!

No, I'm not saying to have sex on every first or second date you go on here.. If you do that, awesome! If not, also awesome! I very much understand the hesitancy some women (and men, but mostly women) have when it comes to having sex for the first time with someone. Will they ghost me after? Is sex all they are trying to get? etc... Very valid concerns, for sure; but at the same time, if someone has no other options while seeing you, or hasn't had sex in a long time, chances are somewhat high they are down to play the ""long game,"" so will wait it out until it happens. 

That aside though, IMO I think it's kind of silly to have a set time frame of when you are willing to have sex. Say it's something like 3 months before you will. That's great and all but, that just seems like a HUGE waste of time, energy, effort, money, etc... to waste on someone only to figure out that when you have sex 3 months down the line, there is zero sexual chemistry or compatibility. And then boom! It's over. You could have put all that time and effort into someone else who you knew 100% was on the same sexual page as yourself.

We date and evaluate a potential partner based off of dozens and dozens of traits, characteristics, values, and whatever else while dating right? Why is sexual compatibility typically the last thing that is evaluated when it's one of the easiest things TO evaluate?

TLDR: Since for most people, sexual chemistry IS very important, why wait so long to figure out if that's even there in the first place? Rather than waste time getting to know someone, develop feelings, and then months later realize there is ZERO sexual chemistry whatsoever?","Doesn‚Äôt the risk even out to be the same, tho? You can wait 3 months and find out you‚Äôre not sexually compatible, or it can be the other way around where you have sex the first date and then realize in 3 months you aren‚Äôt compatible in other ways."
dating,142xixa,1686095882.0,Advice on when to disclose,"Hi guys, I recently started dating someone and I really like him. It's been about a month and I am just thinking long-term about when would be a good time to ease my way into the conversation that I have a diagnosis of bipolar disorder.

dating,142wduw,1686092869.0,dating taking a huge toll on me,"After ending a long term relationship last year, I have been dating. I have been getting dates from dating apps. I like dating, I feel I have learned a lot about what I like and don‚Äôt like and have enjoyed meeting others. But every time I ‚Äútalk‚Äù to someone or starting casually dating someone it takes a huge toll on me. 

It usually goes like:

1. Talk on dating app
2. Move to messaging on text
3. Go on date
4. Things get sexual (edit: usually only one sexual encounter) 
5. They start to be inconsistent and detach
6. I get extremely upset and everything physically hurts

This all happens within 2 weeks. I know things end and I am mostly comfortable with the idea but I always end up feeling used and I am tired of it. 

I don‚Äôt know the kind of responses I want from this post but I guess I want support.

edit: please do not comment about how I should be grateful for getting dates, sex, or even attention. I understand dating is hard for some but those comments making it seem like getting bare minimum is enough when dating.","I am right there with you. I‚Äôve gotten to the point where I‚Äôm no longer going to be having casual sex. I‚Äôve deleted the apps as well bc I found most guys on there are just there for sex and they do exactly what you mentioned above, slowly detaching. It really started to weigh on me. Instead I am devoting my time to hanging out with friends, making new friends, and getting out in the world more. I think meeting people organically is a much better way to meet a potential partner. Focus on you and go out and do hobbies you enjoy to meet new people. F the dating apps honestly."
dating,142w55p,1686092292.0,Being undateable,"I am extremely languished at my life. I am 26 years old and I have never been able to land a single date in my life. I have tried everything from downloading 10 different dating apps and messaging and swiping on thousands of people to going out and asking people out. Ofcourse I get no swipes and in the rare occasion I get a match once every 3 months I get no reply back. In real life if I approach anyone I get no eye contact and get shrugged off. How can I show off my personality to people if no one even bothers looking at me or talking to me? 

You might be inclined to say I dress up badly or I smell bad or I don't go to the gym etc. I have already tried those types of things in the last 7 or 8 years. Nothing has worked for me. Now as an adult I don't even have any friends to talk to. I don't remember even having any  interaction with people my age since I graduated university in 2019. For context I'm Indian and I am currently living in London and before I lived in the US. You may also think that I might be having problems because I'm in a foreign country. However even when I go back to India I get rejected even more. 

I feel like at this point I feel inhumane as if I'm at the bottom of wrung and not even worthy of a single ounce of love. 26 years have passed and I have never had a single date let alone a girlfriend. Also before I'm bombarded with suggestions , believe me I've been on this sub for years and read a plethora of advices and tried everything. Most probably ive already tried it and not worked.

- consistency 
- great sense of humor (if I‚Äôm laughing my ass off you‚Äôve already won me over)

dating,142v7en,1686090032.0,Met the weirdest girl ever (rant),"A few weeks ago, this girl hit me up on this dating app. She was very good looking, awesome conversationalist with a nice bit of sass (dig it) & incredibly sweet. I haven't been on a date in over 2 years because life has been difficult & I've been focusing on my happiness & self-improvement; wasn't seriously looking because I barely get any matches & when I do...I usually just get ghosted or rejected. 

So a week of just flirty messages goes by & she is very forward and asks to hang out. I'm taken by surprise because I have low expectations...so I let her know that I've put on a little bit of weight & haven't been super stable & whatnot, haven't seen anyone in over 2 years.. She gave me an incredibly sweet & thoughtful response --basically saying she doesn't mind a bit of fluff, she hasn't seen anyone in a year, etc.-- and still wanted to see me. At this point I'm like, I couldn't even get rid of this girl if I tried...so maybe this might be different? So she drives to see me & meets me at my apartment. Her vibe was so totally different. She had pigtails, super dolled up, & was very blunt and almost aggressive. She seemed kind of unsure about me & sized me up. She starts talking about how sketchy my apartment is, talks about how my car is junk ...& like...fair points & it's funny so whatever! I take her for a long ride & the conversation is really good. Then she starts talking about her ex-boyfriend from a year ago. She gets really into shit-talking him...saying he gained weight (which i thought she was cool with?) and she would pity fuck him and was disgusted by him. Said that she didn't approve of his finances & the house he bought was a small shack. She goes on to say that she broke up with him & the guy was so ridiculous that she thought he might hurt himself over it. I was just kind of shocked at that point but trying to play it cool; she asks about my ex & I gave her a little run down but said I dont really want to say much out of respect for them. She proceeds to talk about this guy she fucked on a cruise a few weeks ago, & then how she has been messing around with this 40 year old now because he has a big dick (all of which goes against what she said in messages?).  I'm just there like....lol wtf is going on...this girl is fucking with me & clearly has no interest? The date goes on for like 6 hours & she makes even more red-flag comments...like how she hates men, she doesn't want a power imbalance in a relationship, she has to be the pretty one, etc... I'm here like having no idea what to think. I bring her back to her car, she initiates a hug (no way was i trying a kiss in a parking lot after all of that) and we say our goodbyes. 

The next day, she hits me up with messages, saying that she really enjoyed herself & wants to go on another date. I'm like....uhhh...ok, thinking with the wrong part of my body & thinking ""maybe she was just awkward or something"". So we keep talking. I hint at getting a date going but she says that she's going alone to her cabin...so I dont want to bother her. She starts not responding as quickly so I begin to kind of distance myself & never text back unless she replies. This sort of weird game of cat and mouse continued until last night...where I basically just came out and asked what she wanted from me. She said that she isn't really interested in me anymore. I dig into it a bit & she said that she doesn't like how my teeth are yellow (I have a lack of enamel since birth) & she had all of these other guys asking her out on dates & I didnt. She then says that she wants to be friends for now...to which I reply...yea, there's no for now...if we are friends, we are friends and that is it. This seems to take her by surprise & she says that she said for now because that there's a lot of things that she likes about me but I'm a work in progress. Basically ended the conversation with a goodnight & made sure I was the last one to say it...because I dont plan on messaging this girl again. 

Now I'm all kind of fucked up thinking about my teeth lol. I really have no idea what her intentions were with me....did she see ""weakness"" and decided that I would be fun to mess with but she didn't get the right reaction? She did talk a lot about having a psychology degree and messing with people. But yea...feels like a cruel joke given that my 1st date in over 2 years is to this...ummm...person?","This woman is looney tunes, dude. Why are you concerned about what this woman said at all?"

dating,142tyrq,1686087181.0,I just don't understand this girl,"For the past month, there has been a new girl (27F) at the gym that I (26M) find myself in a strange situation with. She has been constantly clinging to me during workouts for the past few weeks, and just three days after we met, she asked me to help her set up a bed frame, which I thought was a little strange and assumed she might be interested in something else.

  
I offered to help her and she accepted, even suggesting that she would buy me dinner as a thank you. We set up the bed frame (nothing happened) and then had a great time having dinner. She invited me, and mentioned that she was paying so that I could invite her next time.  
Since I didn't know what to think of the dinner I asked her if what we just had was a date. She said it hadn't crossed her mind, so I told her I liked her and wanted to get to know her better. She responded by saying that she had recently gotten out of a complicated relationship. To which I replied that I didn't want to force anything and went home.

  
We carried on as normal, the following week we went rock climbing and had a great time. However, I noticed that she started to distance herself a little bit every day.  
The next day, she told me that she had been seeing another girl she liked for two months and that she didn't want to lead me on. She confessed that she was afraid to tell me because she thought I would get angry. I thanked her for her honesty and told her we could still be friends.  
I was happy with how things had turned out. I wasn't angry or anything like that. However, here's what I don't understand about the situation.

  
Two days later, she sent me a message saying that she had stopped seeing the girl because she needed some time alone to reflect. I told her it was a good thing and that I was happy for her.  
The next day at the gym she was VERY touchy, something she had never done before. The next day she was even more touchy, giving me a hug every five minutes, eventually making me uncomfortable, I even had to pull back to avoid a kiss on the cheek because it was too close to my mouth. She even jokingly mentioned that I still owed her dinner.

  
I plan to address the situation by inviting her over for that dinner and talking about everything on it. I'm not sure if she suddenly sees me as a ""gay friend"" or if she's trying something else. While I like to hug my friends, her behavior seems a bit excessive all of a sudden.

dating,142ryed,1686082570.0,Should I stop pursing if she never makes plans or tells me that she wants to see me?,"I've been seeing this woman for about a month now. One thing that I have noticed is, she never asks me to hangout or that she wants to see me. She doesn't ever really texts me first which also kinda bothers me. I text her Good morning every morning and she does reply back and she's always down to hangout. When I make plans with her, we do hangout and she does seem happy to see me but she just never asks me to hangout or that she wants to see me. I have brought up the texting to her and she told me that she always wants the guy to text first. I understand that I am the man and that I need to make the plans, text her first ext. But I would like for her to at least try. I get that me and her are still getting to know each other but dang I would like for her to at least attempt at things, ya know? She's 39 and I am 30. I want to talk to her about this instead of just not talking to her anymore, it just bothers me. How should I go about talking to her about this?","Hmm. Well she's told you she prefers for guys she's seeing to make the first moves. And you're still really really early in getting to know each other. 

Some women who are into the whole femme/masc energy mindset could see you not wanting to do this as much as you not being up for the challenge of being the masculine guy leading the relationship if you want to step back from this role so early. I'm 1000% not saying this is right, but I'm just saying some people think this way.  

If you want to talk to her about it, try to frame the conversations as her meeting you in the middle to show you how she feels about you and why you value that in a relationship, instead of saying you want her to ""lead"" or ""initiate"" sometimes. 

If you truly do not like the level of initiative you're having to take on to keep her interest, you might not be a long term good fit. Hope this helps!"

dating,142rphn,1686081993.0,I broke the gift he gave me and i'm actually suffering a mental breakdown,It was just a lighter but he told me to keep it safe and not lose it and not give it to anyone. My dumbass broke it the next fuckin day although i told him i'm gonna take good care of it. He bought a lighter that really fits me in terms of style and everything and it was the last one in that store. I'm so dumb. I put a cigarette on it and it burned its plastic part and now it has a little hole in it and it doesn't work. Idk how to tell him and now i'm actually thinking that i wanna die lol. I haven't eaten anything for the whole day bc i'm so nervous about this. I don't wanna tell him i broke that lighter. But he's gonna know bc i smoke and if he sees i don't have the lighter he's gonna be so disappointed at me. Idk what's wrong with me i'm just really panicing i don't wanna tell him about this. We've been dating for only 2 weeks and i don't want to break the first gift he gave me. I mean he bought me other things like weed and stuff but they're all temporary things and this was the only thing he gave me that i could actually keep. I just hate myself rn idk what to do i'm actually thinking of self-harm again bc of the guilt i feel,"Hey hey hey - deep breaths. Like actually, take some slow deep breaths. Actually: breathe in slowly, breathe out slowly, repeat a dozen times and then come back to this.

Relax, I promise it's going to be okay. It's totally fine. I know you feel bad, but you don't need to - it was an innocent mistake and you did your best.

I know it's early in the relationship, but this is a small thing, and an accident at that, you did nothing wrong. Very simply share what happened and how you're feeling, share how much you did cherish the gift.

(If he responds with anything hostile, he's a piece of shit and you don't need that in your life.)

But I think it'll be okay. More likely he will see how distressed you are and how much you care and assure you that it'll be okay.

You will be okay no matter what. Please don't hurt yourself, okay? It'll be alright"
dating,142rlsd,1686081745.0,Finding positive mindset as a single in your 30ties - how do you do it?,"Hey reddit community - I am a female in mid 30ties, happy, active and have a good life that I once believed I would share with someone who is equal to me, but I feel with every year passing this is more of a distant fantasy rather than a reality. So I am after some advice from some of you who have gone through something similar, and have accepted that maybe you will just stay single by choice, and not have your partner-in-crime and 2.4 kids - and how to do it without 'faking' happiness.

For reference I am 32(F), consider myself quite attractive and take good care of myself, I run my own successful business, and live in a small rural town (which can be problematic when everyone under the age of 40 is already married). I haven't been in a relationship for about 5 years, and have 'completed' dating apps numerous times, and to be honest I can't say I've seen too many people on there that would take my fancy - I'm more of a cheeky/witty bio & prompts girl, which most guys simply invest no time in.

When I ended my last relationship, first I was like, yay, freedom, and in the last 5 years I have built my own successful business, started numerous hobbies (gym, running, surfing, skateboarding, hiking), have a great group of friends surrounding me, love the place where I live (even though it's remote) and generally am really happy with my day-to-day life. But there are also days when I physically have pain in my heart as I feel that I have so much love to give to someone, and share a truly epic adventurous life with this person and it really saddens me that I have 'failed' to find them.

I have attempted dating from time to time via Hinge, but unfortunately nothing has stuck. I feel the modern dating world is like dating on speed - there's certain goal posts to be met by date 1, 2 and 3 and 5, otherwise you are just wasting someones time. For me attraction takes a long time to develop and I need time to get to know people's quirks, and how they view the world and treat others to see if I can actually fancy them in a romantic sense. In the past (pre-dating apps) I only dated people who were my friends first for months or years, which  would be quite difficult given that most of my male friends are already married! Nowadays, when I do date, I think I always attract guys who are a fair bit insecure in themselves (be it their looks, or their career), clingy and generally are looking for constant reassurance from my side, which for me is a huge turn-off. I am independent and confident in who I am as a person both personally and professionally, so I struggle to connect to guys who are clingy by date 2-3 and expect a lifelong commitment. I have spoken to a couple of my friends whether I should just settle for one of these guys, as they are all perfectly acceptable in many ways, but I feel it'd be so unfair to do so on both of us (I sure would hate to be on the other side of this equation), so I normally just cut these relationships off before I feel the other person starts to develop feelings that I simply can't reciprocate. I was stuck in a relationship like this for 6 months, where I kept thinking, he's a nice/funny/smart guy, the feelings will surely come, but 6 months later I still didn't feel that connection with him, and breaking it off made me feel so horrible, like I was just stringing him along even though we had multiple conversations about how it takes me ancient turtle time to fall for someone, but it still sucked when the feelings just didn't come.

Anyways, I haven't really dated at all for a year, (turns out the same guys are still on the apps even years later), and am slowly slipping into the state of, hey, the problem is me not them, and maybe this is just the way it's meant to be. I am not the sort of person who fusses over being single in my day-to-day life, I have a very busy and adventurous life, but there's those moments of sadness that come up, especially when going to parties and events where everyone is coupled up, and I really struggle to get over the sadness and loneliness when I get home. Are there any happy & single folk out there in their 30ties who have managed to get over this feeling, and have come to acceptance with the fact that they simply might stay single, but this is an active choice? I need some advice how to turn my mindset from I am failing at my basic human task to find a mate to a positive one of I am free, happy and thriving in my solo adventure. Are there any books/audiobooks/podcasts anyone can recommend?",Following this cause i feel the same way. Virtual hugs!
dating,142rkbk,1686081660.0,Guy I‚Äôm dating says he‚Äôs scared to let me down,"I‚Äôve (30F) been dating/seeing a guy (35M) for nearly 4 months. It‚Äôs been going great.

We recently spent 7 days together in Spain which was quite intense but overall fun.

I‚Äôm very affectionate and wear my heart on my sleeve - I‚Äôm very touchy and show my feelings that way. He‚Äôs not the same so I sometimes struggle to know how he feels towards me. He doesn‚Äôt verbalize it much either.

I brought it up and he told me that he has walls up because he was hurt and manipulated in his last serious relationship. But that he does like me a lot. 

I understand people have different boundaries and experiences and I told him I‚Äôd support him if he needed me to - but I just don‚Äôt know where it leaves me because his differences make me feel like his feelings are not reciprocated. 


He said he gets scared of being vulnerable/ close to someone because he‚Äôs scared of letting people down. 

What does that mean? How do I proceed?","That‚Äôs a tricky one.  Some people will gradually open up as they get to know you and feel safer, but some people never do.  You‚Äôll just have to see how this plays out for the two of you, but it may end up that you‚Äôre incompatible.

dating,142r0ya,1686080421.0,Need help finding a country-loving guy,"This is the first time I've posted on reddit so I am pretty new to all of this!

Here is the situation: I (23F) am tired of the men out in LA. I know I am still young but I know what I want in terms of values in a partner and I know most of these traits fall within country-loving guys which I have dated in the past. Some of you will probably say you should move out of California to find one of these guys, but I have a good career and my entire family/friends are out here so its one of my boundaries. Now I love a good ol' southern gentleman and I find their accents so cute. I like that they tend to be more mature than the men out here, know how to work with their hands, prioritize family, very manly, and don't even get me started on men who wear cowboy hats & boots! 

I would love to find a someone like this but it seems almost impossible to find one out in SoCal. And don't get me wrong I go to country bars, ride horses, so I feel like I'm at least TRYING to put myself around this ""genre"" of men but I'm finding it difficult. I would appreciate any advice where I could find myself a someone with these traits, good dating apps, places to hangout, and would even like to hear how you and your current partner met!","It honestly could just be where you live.

dating,142qy6o,1686080243.0,I need some advice with this guy,"So basically I was giving the c2 speaking exams a few days ago, and I got paired with a guy who is about 2 years older. While we were waiting we were talking and he was trying to hold the conversation for as long as he could and he seemed like he was always trying to speak to me. A little before the examiner took us in to start with the examination he asked me if I had a boyfriend and I said no. When I said that he seemed really surprised. Then I asked him if he had a girlfriend and he said that he was talking with a girl some time back and they basically did something like a one night stand and then she ghosted him. As he said, after this he isn't planing to text her again because he is not interested. Then the examiner took us in the room to start the examination. When it finished, and we were leaving the building I asked him for his Instagram and he saw me his user name. I didn't have my phone with me the time he showed me so I told him that I'd add him in a bit. So when I got it I added his Instagram and texted him asking if he was the guy from the exams the he said yea that was me with this emoji next to it:üòÖ and then I texted back ohh alright, it was nice to meet you and he replied back saying ""haha nice to meet you tooüòÅ""
After that we didn't talk again but I have doubts that I was too cringe and that's why he doesnt want to text me. Or maybe he wasn't interested at all and was just asking to pass his time. I really dont know what to assume anymore. But I kinda like him and I want to try at least to fix my image. 
Any advice would be really helpful",
dating,142qv2h,1686080041.0,Have you ever dated a person that didn't pay for things. Has never paid for a date? Did they contribute to the relationship?,"So I'm dating a young Jamaican girl. 
I paid by coincidence. 
Then I mentioned she should pay for the next one, and she looked like I told her she could lose some weight. 
So maybe it's just a cultural adjustment. 
I've never been with a black girl. Or a Jamaican. Is that their thing?
Maybe she's looking for a daddy Dom. I don't like the idea of being a daddy, I've never been one, but she would make a very pretty pet.
Maybe she's just broke, and ashamed to admit it?
I of course am most worried that she will take and not contribute. I want a partner that contributes. 

Do you have any experience with this? How did it end up?
Are there scenarios I should look out for, or questions I could ask?","Based on the title, I came here ready to give an opinion on paying and when people should start contributing more equally, etc etc. But I am now fixated on:

> I‚Äôve never been with a black girl. Or a Jamaican. Is that their thing? Maybe she‚Äôs looking for a Daddy Dom. I don‚Äôt like the idea of being a daddy, but she‚Äôd make a very pretty pet. 

I‚Äôm going to tell you right now, while it‚Äôs early, you‚Äôre going to get toasted for this right here. There is a chance this is a troll post and you knew that, but I‚Äôll give you the benefit of the doubt and assume ignorance. 

It‚Äôs generally not good to generalize people by ethnicity like that. First, the way the post is written, I question if you know whether she‚Äôs Jamaican or black (yes, they are different). It also seems like you‚Äôre either starting to form some biases about darker skinned women or are vocalizing biases that may have always been there. So let me help you. 

No, this is not a Black, Jamaican, or dark-skinned woman thing. Some women just like to be paid for a lot. You could have a deep discussion about opinions on that, but I‚Äôd argue it‚Äôs more about the cultural expectation for men to pay, rather than darker women looking to be paid for more frequently than lighter colored women.

The date was really good, we laugh, the conversation flowed and we kiss in the end of the night.

But online communication is really not that good. It feels like I have to keep making subjects for her to keep talking.

The first time I asked her out she said ‚Äúfinally, all this talk and you didn‚Äôt ask me out yet?‚Äùlol

She is really busy, and overachiever and I think that‚Äôs great (and maybe explains why she is kinda dry by text?)

The thing is she is a friend from work of a friend and I don‚Äôt have much chance to see her face to face.

So, nowadays, is possible to create a meaningful connection without frequent digital communication? What you guys think about that?","I am really big on witty chatting/banter between dates as it keeps me interested and excited to see them again. If their 'texting game' is below par and we can't see each other frequently enough (distance, work commitments) I will likely pull away. There's nothing worse for me than someone saying ""oh, I'll just tell you in person"" - like come on you can't give me a quick summary/preview into this incredible story you have for me? I need mental/verbal stimulation for me to remain interested in someone for sure, and if they can't deliver it, I just don't think it'd be a relationship I'd want to invest in long term.

Fast forward 9 years later and nothing like that has happened to me since","Alcohol definitely helps people lose their inhibitions which allows them to be more confident and do such approaches without really thinking twice, whereas, when you're sober, you tend to overthink such situations and worry more about what someone is going to think."
dating,142pe5k,1686076850.0,If you were isolated growing up I think the dating game is just over in general,"I want to preface this by saying that I do think most people have potential in the dating market, for the vast majority of people they‚Äôre well-adjusted and have enough qualities that would make them a good partner. All of this is also admittedly anecdotal as it‚Äôs based on my own experience as someone in this situation.

With this, as someone who grew up isolated , I don‚Äôt think you have a chance in the dating market if you came from a background like this for so many reasons.

The biggest one is social skills and having normalized social situations. It took me years just to be somewhat comfortable in social situation, nevermind being proficient in talking to others or flirting. If you‚Äôre isolated you simply don‚Äôt get those small experiences of talking to people and being around others that most people get in high school and the like, which understandably sets you back.

There‚Äôs also the issue of potential trauma that comes with that background. For many others including myself, you also have to live with CPTSD, PTSD or a myriad of other mental illnesses because fun fact: people don‚Äôt do well under isolation for ling periods of time. This in itself I feel is a death sentence as mental health gets painted as such a red flag that you basically just get written off the minute you start talking about it. I hate how I‚Äôm penalized for something I had no control over, even when I‚Äôm getting help such as medication and therapy. But it isn‚Äôt enough, because apparently having a mental illness gives people ‚Äúthe ick‚Äù which, tbf they are entitled to that, but at the same time you feel really empty.

I feel like I‚Äôm broken and no one will want me. I want love so bad and have for so long but it‚Äôs something that you can‚Äôt even talk about for fear of sounding entitled.

It‚Äôs all a joke, life is so shitty, I just want to fucking die. I didn‚Äôt ask for this to happen but I‚Äôm fucking here anyways, just fucking kill me","Isolation may put you behind, but there‚Äôs no time limit on learning/improving social skills.  Whether or not the dating game is ‚Äúover‚Äù for you depends entirely on what you do about you mental health and social skills.  If you throw up your hands and say ‚Äúwell, I guess I‚Äôm just screwed‚Äù then it IS most likely over.  If you‚Äôre open to learning and getting better, then who knows how much you can gain?"

We were on our third date last Sunday and at dinner, when someone stopped stopped by and said hello. When I looked up it turned out to be Brad, a long time friend my older brother and family. 

Brad and I have a history. While I was growing up, he was very fond of me and I had a secret crush on him. Then after high school he and my brother both moved away to college on different coasts and I didn‚Äôt see Brad for few years. Then last summer he was back in town on business (he works at a west coast tech company now), I was thrilled to see him. To make the long story short, we hung out together a lot and I gave up my virginity to him. He took my sex education rather seriously. It was a memorable week I spent with him. 

This time, when I saw him I was pleasantly surprised, and but I expected him to just briefly exchange pleasantries and move on. Instead, he stood there talking seemingly to want to catch up. After several minutes, my date said to Brad, may he should pull up a chair and sit. I think he expected that will make Brad to move on. Instead, Brad did exactly as asked and sat down with us knowing I was on a date, and went in telling my date how he had known me all my life and how ‚Äúclose‚Äù we were and so in. Within minutes I began to see that my date sensed that there was much more between Brad and me. 

He politely said to Brad and me that, he‚Äôd rather us catch up with each other. With that he stood up and left after paying for the dinner before exiting. Needless to say I felt utterly humiliated I too walked out.",Well shit atleast your date got out of that mess with grace poor dude
dating,142nvkc,1686073978.0,Any step could be an easy step for me (venting),"Hi, I'm M24, looked for a thread that resonates more with my current mental state. 
I have no friends. The ones I had back in Italy (where I'm from) I can call them childhood friends but they weren't ever real ones. Then I've lost the ones from England, where I reside. Because my father is Muslim and wanted to kill me for having a relationship. So I had to escape home and go to my ex because my friends didnt have space nor the abily to help me. The police didnt arrive until andother day later. And i wasnt gonan stay where I'm in danger,  my friends translated me, leaving town, to me preferring p***y than real friends and the life i had. Not realising the situation was way morr complex than that. I'm not Muslim just a simple dude. 
I spent the last 6 years of my life trying to make haply my relationships. 
The first one, I followed her everywhere. She helped me, and I gave up the dream of studying music because I felt like I owed her so much I wanted to give back all of me. To a result, she just never appreciated that. And I lost about 3 years of my life, friends and family. 
During that time my best friend knew it everything and she was jealous i wasn't her bf. At fist to this info I wasn't eager to jump into another relationship after about 6 months or so. But I trusted her with my eyes closed and I knew her qualities. So when she asked me I said yes. With confidence this was the one. 
I sacrificed a lot to be with her. Travelling to her country. Working. But due to her BPD she unconsciously was pushing me away. There was a lot of anger she was taking on me that made me feel drained and at some point, I had to put an end to such stress..
And another 3 years are gone. 
Both were distant relationships until I moved with them somewhere else.

Now, I've seen 16 countries. Lived in 7 cities. Tried to go back to college 4 times. And changed an incalculable amount of jobs because I was giving all of me to these people. 
Only thing I did for myself was: stay true to myself and to the people I loved. Commit to the bone and, I built a gaming pc which I barely used. But I was proud of it. 

Now I question myself. What's the point o being so eager to do so much for someone that someday might not be there anymore? 2 relationships were enough for me to question my worth because the first one cheated, and the second one basically lied to me over the nice things she would assure me she meant. That I was worth something. I lost so much in the process I lost who I was. 

Now I'm like isolated. Stranded in a place where family members are busy, don't understand me, and I understand everyone has its life going on I don't complain. Making friends it's impossible because in this virtual world no one actually comes forward saying ""wanna chat? Be friends?"" When I do I'm weird so ok, ill be quiet. And even dating. We became objects apparently, put on a shelf and people pick who they MAY have some interest on but ultimately doesn't do any effort to connect with those people. 
And I'm here questioning life in general due to how quiet my surroundings are from when I wake up to when I go to sleep. Sometimes I even end up talking to myself and make scenarios and when I realise that I stop and, since I'm unable to cry it out, I'm just storing anger that this is my life now. I have to come to terms that apparently I'm the only one willing to go an extra mile to make things work whether with a friend, relationships or family. 

You may wonder ""why is this guy feeling lonely he just cane out of a toxic relationship and he has family members around"" yeah well remember what Robin Williams said? It's worse to be surrounded by people who make you feel alone.
I'm not even asking for a potential date or anything like that. I just wish to find people to connect with and spend time with. Talking and open up and help one another. 
I'm settled. I have everything I need and I have the balls to go anywhere i want. I've done it before I can do it again. 
Yet all I think about it either death or the injustice this life has offered me. How loud my head is compared to how silent my surroundings are. And sometimes even think maybe my exs were right. I'm worth nothing. Despite all the effort and sacrifice you could offer to a single individual I'm here completely abandoned to myself and I haven't been proven wrong whatsoever. 

So any step for me could be an easy step.
Wanna move somewhere else? I can.
Wanna change work? I can.
Die? I can. 

Saddest part? I know I'm not the only one feeling utterly abandoned to one self with little to no hope of it changing. But ultimately I wouldn't be surprised if no one here said ""I'll talk to you"". So not only we profess to be lonely,  but we do nothing to change that. (At least so far, I haven't been proven wrong on this. Seemingly people don't want to try) and I can understand if they are scared, or not trust or don't have the energy. I really do understand it. It's just yknow, we are 8 billions behaving the same way? We are doomed then. Truly.

I wanted to vent. Y'all can say I'm dumb or something it's fine. Not the first time. Not the last. 
But if someone here is in dire need of someone to talk to that's me. I'd be a liar and a hypocrite to say otherwise.",

I'm just tired of the grind that my dating life has turned into I'm tired of having seemingly good first dates only to get ghosted, I'm tired of being stood up and of the slow fades and of getting crushes on girls just for them to eventually realize they don't want me. I'm tired of expecting and waiting for the message after a date where she says she doesn't want to see me again. mostly though I'm tired of the loneliness, I can't stand this emptiness I can physically feel inside me but I can't escape it either, its so pertinent, just always there reminding me of something I want to forget about sometimes. I've been told by a more than few people that I should be glad that I've never had relationship because that means my heart has never been broken but I can't help but resent that statement because I feel like my heart has been broken, the pain I've felt is real and that statement just feels dismissive. I just want someone to hold and who will hold me, I want validation and love that doesn't HAVE to come from me, I want external proof that I am worth it. maybe I'm just touch starved, who knows, it's been a few years since I've had a really good hug.

dating,142mluo,1686071552.0,Saving sex for commitment,"I am 28f and quite frankly am exhausted from the past decade of heartbreak, abusive relationships and casual sex. I had this awakening moment recently after a guy left me for his ex and then the next said he only wanted casual after we went on a few dates and had sex. If I have feelings for someone and want more I don‚Äôt think I want to have sex with them until they state that they want a commitment with me. 

Obviously saving sex for a commitment doesn‚Äôt prevent the guy from ditching right after, but god dammit at least you have the dignity of saying we were together, he made it known we were together and I upheld a standard for myself. It is so heart breaking to be with a guy, but have no label for some bullshit reason and the next week see them giving a girlfriend everything you wanted. 

Part of me is sad that the days of fun casual sex are ending because I‚Äôm aware that that is a sacrifice, but I don‚Äôt think my heart can take it anymore. Withholding sex for a commitment also makes things so much less confusing. I definitely struggle with CPTSD and self discipline to saying no to pleasure right now which ends up hurting my long term goals. If I don‚Äôt do things differently I truly see myself in a decade being in this exact position.

dating,142lsco,1686069545.0,id I Make the Right Choice Prioritizing My Job?,"Hey Reddit,

I'm feeling a bit lost and could use some perspective. I'm a 25-year-old woman who recently went through a breakup with my boyfriend of two months. He ended things because he felt that I didn't put enough time and effort into our relationship and that I was too focused on my job.

To provide some context, I've always been ambitious and driven in my career. I work as a content creator in girlie magazines. I've worked hard to establish myself and have been dedicated to climbing the professional ladder. However, this seems to have affected my romantic relationships in the past.

I genuinely believed that I could balance my career aspirations and a budding romance, but now I'm questioning if I made the right choice by prioritizing my job. I always thought it was important to focus on personal growth and financial stability at this stage in my life, but now I'm questioning if I've neglected my love life.

So, Reddit, I'm turning to you for some advice. Have any of you been in a similar situation? Did you prioritize your career over a relationship, and if so, how did it turn out for you? Or, on the other hand, did you put your job on hold to focus on love, and how did that work out?

I'd love to hear your experiences and insights to help me gain some clarity in this confusing time.

TL;DR: My boyfriend broke up with me because he felt I prioritized my job over our relationship. Now I'm questioning if I made the right choice. Have any of you faced a similar situation, and how did it turn out for you?

Thanks in advance for your support and advice.","There's nothing wrong with focusing on your career. Your ex also isn't wrong for wanting to focus on the relationship, especially if he's looking for something long term. Your goals just aren't compatible, it happens."

A line like - ""I really liked talking to you and getting to know you before our date but I unfortunately did not feel a romantic spark in person and I'm not interested in going on another date"" is very straightforward and also not critical to any specific part of him.

A helpful tip for the future is to avoid having too much lengthy conversation prior to the first date. It can feel fun and exciting but you find yourself in scenarios like this. Much easier to meet up first and see if that spark/attraction is there in real life and THEN start investing more time in getting to know them, etc, etc."
dating,142jnoc,1686065420.0,Hook up culture (Do you think the pros out way the cons)?,"Pro:

hookup culture can provide a sense of sexual freedom and exploration, as well as allow people to have fun and enjoy physical intimacy without the pressure of a committed relationship. It can also be a way to learn about oneself and one's desires, as well as practice communication and consent skills. Additionally, it can challenge traditional gender roles and expectations, as well as promote sexual positivity and destigmatization.

Con: 

hookup culture can potentially lead to negative physical and emotional consequences. It can increase the risk of sexually transmitted infections and unwanted pregnancies, as well as cause emotional distress or confusion. Additionally, it can perpetuate a culture where people are objectified and treated as disposable, rather than valued for their individuality and humanity.","Honestly the cons completely out weigh the pros, with how prevalent STDs are now plus it causes people serious emotional trauma if you aren't a psychopath.

I really enjoy seeing him and he makes me really happy but this impending expiration date is kind of just bumming me out. I don‚Äôt want to, but I wonder if it wouldn‚Äôt be better for me in the long run to just end it now than let it drag out over the summer and get more attached in the process.

I think maybe this is another talk you should have with him. Maybe he‚Äôs feeling the same way.
dating,142ja69,1686064652.0,I am super interested in a guy but he's being really hot and cold,"I am super interested in a guy and we've messaged a lot but he's being really hot and cold lately. I get that he's busy at work and stuff but I am confused.

What should I do? Why is he being like this? Any advice?

Thank you","Here is dating 101.

You put forth the effort that is being matched. Not on a day to day basis, but certainly on a week to week basis.

A huge mistake I see people make is tying their emotions to a situation that does not warrant it. When two people are right for a relationship, neither person can stay away even if they tried. It‚Äôs electric.

As adults we all get busy at times and need some understanding of that, but the hot and cold bit is one of two things.

1) His natural personality needs far less communication than most people. 

2) He is giving his attention to a new potential chick/s, and coming back to you if new opportunities Peter out.

These are the most likely scenarios.

Back off and see if he comes hot and heavy back after you. If he doesn‚Äôt, you‚Äôre wasting your time."

dating,142g8qb,1686058328.0,Safety (as a man),"As a cis-het dude (probably) I hear the word ""confidence"" getting tossed around a lot. Needing to be confident. Needing to *exude* confidence. And with that comes the micromanagement of my smile, my body, whether to hold hands, when to offer a physical embrace, etc. Because that's what we're expected to do: be confident. Make the *other* person feel safe.

I've always rankled at this arms-race of confidence, and now I think I understand why. Being confident helps my potential partner feel safe, but what good does that do when *I* don't feel safe with them?

Looking back, I have hardly ever felt safe or secure with the women I've dated. There's always been an uncomfortable distance. A coldness. Or maybe not coldness, but an air of tension. As if they keep waiting for me to give them something without offering any clues. And I keep trying to perform (often overperform) with humor or forced enthusiasm, resulting in either A) my dates leaving early or B) radio silence after the fact. The end result is a bad date, not specifically because nothing came of it, but because I end up a nervous wreck, which in turn feeds my self-loathing issues. All because I spend 99% of the date in a state of utter panic or despair.

Take my last date. I had been talking to this person online for a while, but when we met up things were different. We hugged, but it didn't feel right. She kept looking at me as if expecting something, but I couldn't figure out what. Any jokes or levity I attempted to inject into the date fell flat, or were answered with what felt like jabs at my expense (really it was at the expense of Capitalism or the art world or whatever, but still). She ended up leaving early, which was honestly for the best, and I felt horrible for days after.

Now let's look at a counterexample. Because yes, sometimes my dates *do* go well. I met a woman at a friend's party, and she had the best sense of humor. Apparently she thought I was cute, because she asked a mutual friend for my contact info. Our first date was great, because everything she did put me at ease. We listened to music in my car, we constantly made dirty jokes while at the zoo, we improvised when a museum we had wanted to visit was packed, and the whole experience made me feel good. You could say ""hey dumbass, the difference is that she actually *liked* you."" But it was more than that. I *could* be confident around her, because she made an effort to make me feel *safe*. We went out a few times after that, and no, a relationship didn't happen. But at least we had fun. At least I think about that experience with fondness rather than anxiety or sorrow.

I guess my point is, I need to stop seeing dating as a confidence game. Because it's not, at least for me. I need someone who makes me feel safe. And I have to wonder how many other dudes (or non cis-het women/non-binary folk) feel the same way, but either live in denial or have become accustomed to not being heard.","This was honestly an eye opening read for me.

It's never really truly occurred to me how much open encouragement guys probably need. Especially these days when it seems everyone's actions and words are under such an intense microscope.

I'm a firm believer in very forthright communication. But I never really thought about how much reassuring was necessary for some guys in order to make them feel comfortable to express what they want to, whether that's physically or otherwise. It makes sense though, since I'm sure a lot of men don't want to come off as creepy or weird or trying too hard, etc."

So first of all I‚Äôm 20 

My problem is that I very rarely find people interesting enough to date. I dunno if my standards are just high but as an example 

I would like someone who does not wear heavy make up and is fit. Ideally attractive aswell. intelligence is also important. No alcohol no smoking. 
And of course the personality must match with mine. 

To me: 

My pros/neutrals: 

- 20y
- I‚Äôm 5‚Äò8 
- apparently attractive 
- thick hair 
- thick beard 
- well groomed
- colognes/style are on point 
- fit / not shredded but getting there 
- I constantly read books and go to the gym to become a even better person. 
- apparently I have a great personality and a big heart 

My cons : 

- still a student so no real job yet. 
- semi social 
- I don‚Äôt go out very often 
- I tend take rejections rather hard due to me having a anxious attachment style and not finding women I like very often. 
- I practically have no experience with women and I dunno how to really flirt.

From the beginning, 3h long phone conversations once/twice a day, big words prior to first meeting (day dreaming about our life together, I have talked about you to my parents, I would like to visit your home country with you and travel together, if you lived with me etc) showering me with compliments...it felt pretty fake to me.

During the first meeting he was extremely smooth, showered me with compliments all the time, he even gifted me a pair of silver earrings, which again, didn't feel genuine.

we kissed during the first meeting and he invited me to his place, I said no. he said he respected it but insisted 40 other times. I kept saying no.

We met another time and he was pretty lukewarm, phone calls diminished greatly, and his pace of answering messages was way longer, many times he even refused my calls and didn't call back nor sent a mess to explain what's up. the second time he tried to have sex again and I said no. (I explained to him prior that i need to feel comfortable with someone in order to have sex).

This weekend, after canceling a date and not rescheduling, and disappearing for almost a whole day, I called it quits.

I explained to him that I don't like inconsistent behavior and his interest seems superficial (he has never been really interested in knowing me, more interested of talking about himself).

dating,142c455,1686048855.0,Why did he ghost? Was he lying to me?,"*TLDR:* date a guy for 2 months, green flags all the way, until he asks to put things on hold while he travels for a month, but keep in touch and pick up when he‚Äôs back, declining my offer to visit him and seemingly freaking out about the relationship and wanting to keep things more casual. Then a few days into the trip he ghosts. 

*Background:* dated 2.5 months, hung out 2-3 nights a week since the 2nd week, talked every day since the 2nd week, not exclusive, started sleeping together a month in, both expressed we liked each other many times, both expressed we wanted a monogamous relationship, both showed up consistently for each other, both were asking questions like we were truly trying to get to know each other, both been vulnerable with each other, developed inside jokes. All green flags except it concerned me didn‚Äôt want to be exclusive yet a month into dating me (hadn‚Äôt slept together yet at the point I brought it up) saying he equated it to being bf/gf official, and I figured, fine, I can give it another month or so if that‚Äôs what he needs to feel comfortable 

Fast forward to 2-month mark, a Sat night: he casually dropped into the conversation that he‚Äôs leaving for a month of work travel the following week. I say maybe I can coordinate a weekend to visit and we leave it at that. Then I go back to my place Sun Eve, usual routine, and something is off the next week. Its the day before he‚Äôs supposed to leave, Wed, and he‚Äôs not tried to make plans to see me before leaving or for when he‚Äôs gone. 

So I call him and, cutting an hour long emotional call short: he‚Äôs hesitant the whole time about what to do, big back and forth but summary is he thinks long distance sucks, he‚Äôs not sure if he‚Äôs ready, its going to be an insanely busy trip, and he‚Äôs not sure if it makes sense for me to visit but he wants to stay in touch and pick things up when he‚Äôs back and he really really likes me. I declined saying I‚Äôm not down to keep in touch, ambiguity not for me, but have a good trip. He asked me to change his mind. I go okay‚Ä¶feels weird to have to sell you on wanting to see me but: you seem to be overthinking this, I‚Äôm not trying to rush things, but how else would we keep dating, etc etc, then with more certainty that his gut is to wait til he‚Äôs back. I say okay. 

My general rule is ‚Äúnot ready‚Äù means ‚Äúnever gonna happen‚Äù, but I went back and forth for 5 days whether given how much we had up to that point, the sudden travel, maybe this time was different, and against my better judgment messaged him that I‚Äôd be okay to keep in touch. He again said he liked me and cared about me and missed me. Then we go back to texting as normal, a few long messages per day (most of his updates being that he‚Äôs busy and overwhelmed) but then 3 days later, asks me for an update, I wrote a paragraph or two, and then he never responded. That was 2 weeks ago. I didn‚Äôt send anything else. 

*My questions are:*

-why ghost? Like I get it, he‚Äôs selfish and immature, but in this particular situation, why ghost? We‚Äôd gotten so close up to that point, and he was a good communicator, seemed a genuine person, honest, seemed deeply invested, and seemed to have a moral backbone. Did he like and care about and miss me one week, and change his mind the next? Had he been manipulating me the whole time? Not sure if anyone is that good an actor. Did he just suddenly lose interest, some fearful avoidant shit? Is there someone else? Or no one specific, just wants to screw around freely? WHY suddenly destroy a great thing? Does he not think of this as ghosting, or not a big deal ‚Äúkeep in touch‚Äù is loose, and he‚Äôd already said it was on hold til he‚Äôs back, and doesn‚Äôt think he‚Äôs destroying anything?

-what are the chances he gets back and texts me to hang out when he‚Äôs back in town? How do I respond? Is there any reality in which he‚Äôs not a POS? Having a hard time reconciling the two versions of him. 

*Notes to self:* never start sleeping with a guy without being exclusive again, ‚Äúnot ready‚Äù does indeed pretty much always mean ‚Äúnever gonna happen‚Äù

Edit: Thanks everyone, feeling much clearer and greatly relieved, not losing my fucking mind anymore, after reading the responses

Edit 2: placing my bet now, will update in a month: someone new and exciting/an old flame came along mid-May in that city, he will message within a week when he‚Äôs back, ranging from coming on strong to telling me he met someone, most likely just a tepid check in.",Why do some people choose to ghost others instead of communicating openly?

During our conversation he said that likes dark haired women (I'm not). He said he hoped I will find someone in the city I live in currently. I wished him the same. He mentioned all his past girlfriends. He was really open about everything.


I'm leaving the country now but realised I really fancy that guy. Do you think he is interested? Should I text him saying that I do? Nothing will happen probably but I feel like I want to get it out of my system.... Would that be too creepy? 

Update : 
I sent him another message saying sorry for sending that.

He sent a brilliant reply and now we're friends again. Actually I now realise why I had the feelings, basically it's because he went through similar things I went through.

Now that I've calmed down it males sense and he handled it very well. Actually really happy to know this person.

Tl;dr I (F28) fancy guy (M36) I met twice but not sure he likes me.
Should I tell him that I think I like him? Do you think he might like me?","If you are about to leave the country, then there is definitely no harm in full openness, for the clarity of the situation!"
dating,142anqr,1686045054.0,AITA for not giving my boyfriend money? I 22(F) refused to give my 24(M) boyfriend ¬£40 for a surprise breakfast.,"I 22(F) refused to give my 24(M) boyfriend money for the surprise breakfast he bought me this weekend.

For context my boyfriend and I have been together for 5 years and share a 4 year old son. We live separately, he has his own apartment and I live with our son at my parents house. I‚Äôm a full time student without a stable income. My monthly income is around ¬£300 and has to cover all expenses, including providing for our son. My boyfriend has a well paid job, his disposable income is more than my entire monthly income, and he rarely contributes financially towards our son‚Äôs school fees, clothing or anything else that he might need.

This weekend we went to a family event and I may have ended up a bit hungover the next morning. My boyfriend very kindly surprised me with a takeaway breakfast and I was very appreciative. However, on the way home he asked me to send me ¬£40 for the food. I was surprised by this as he chose to surprise me with a nice breakfast and I did not ask him to do this. Also he is well aware that I do not have much money since paying our sons school fees. I had ¬£5 in my bank account and stated that I was not willing to take the money out of my savings account for him.

Am I the asshole for refusing to give him the money?",Nope and hes a nice type....dont know why you're still seeing him...

dating,1428vrs,1686040203.0,I (m18) miss my exgirlfriend (f18),"Her name is O. She was my first love and my first breakup. It has been a little over a month since she broke up with me. I genuinely loved her so much and I'm having so much trouble getting over her. We dated for 6 months and 2 weeks. I don't know how to cope healthily, and I am currently seeing a psychiatrist because this breakup really just pushed me over the edge.   
I think it's important that I preface this by stating that she's mildly autistic, and I have ADHD and have been undergoing a serious depression for a few months. She said she broke up with me because being in a relationship was very stressful for her. She emphasized the fact that it wasn't me specifically, just the whole romance aspect. She wanted to break up so she could prioritize her own mental health. She was very unclear on whether or not we were just taking a break, or if it was over forever.  
After we broke up, she started making plans with a lot of new friends. I did not make her feel like she couldn't do this while in a relationship with me, so I'm not sure why this was a change she made after breaking up with me. She is also drinking way more than she did when she wasn't dating me. We both struggle with alcoholism and it feels like the breakup didn't do either of us good in that regard. She has also been a straight A student all her life, but now she just seems to not care. I hate to see her struggling so much, and I don't understand why she would breakup with me. I feel like she made a mistake, but I also know that she is completely valid to break up with me for whatever reason.   
I really loved her a lot. She was my first romantic relationship and first kiss. I hate seeing her doing so poorly and I wish I could help her. I feel some sort of resentment towards her and I wish I didn't. I miss her so much and I don't know what to do. Should I tell her that I miss her? Do I just watch my favorite person completely let themself go? I feel so sad, I love her so much.  
tldr: I miss my wonderful exgirlfriend. do i reach out?","She doesn't care about you move along sir.Get your life in order,your mental health in order and something better will come along."

She was happy and cute with me then after 1 year and half she really turned 180‚Å∞. She was listening to everyone talks shit about me. Even tho they were nice to me when they meet me but in my back they talk shit i know that but i really didn't care for what they are saying the only thing i cared about is what my ex says and thinking about me. So i saw her she was really toxic even our relationship was too toxic. she wanted to break up and i didn't want to i just want to fix it after manytime i said ok let's break up. So she told me you hate me because you agree for the break up and i don't like this plays... whatever after one year i dated another girl but in distance with video call not irl everything was fine after 1 weeks with no talk ( exams time ) she told me that she is engaged from her neighbor and she accepted i was really shocked. So i decided to not date anyone until I'll be ready to find the right girl and propose to her for marriage. Now im only focusing on my work gym sometimes play video games with friends but im out from dating.,"You're going to have to date in order to find the right person though.

He was nice, fun to hang out with, so I kept seeing him, but finally realized the romantic feelings haven‚Äôt grown. Since we‚Äôd seen each other for a good chunk of time, I wanted to respectfully tell him this in person, as I felt just a text would be disrespectful.

Anyway, I meet up with him and say my
 peace, he says he was kinda on the same page, ended amicably although a bit awkward. 5 mins after I leave, I get a text saying that ‚Äúit‚Äôs annoying that you dragged it out and felt the need to have that conversation in person‚Äù and ‚Äúthat a clean break really doesn‚Äôt need an in person date in my opinion.‚Äù

I‚Äôm just discouraged. I went out of my way to try and do what I thought was the right and respectful thing, and he apparently wanted it in a text. 

I‚Äôve got to get a thicker skin for dating.

**update**
Since so many people asked, I didn‚Äôt take him somewhere public to do it. I asked to talk, and went over to his place so we could have privacy.","I‚Äôm a woman and I would be pissed if some guy wanted to meet up with me and I took the time to get ready and go out only so he could dump me.

dating,14278ue,1686035577.0,Can a guy genuinely be interested in remaining friends after a causal fling?,"I was dating or having a causal fling with a guy from January -April. Prior to that we were casual friends for a year. In that friendship, there was no intimacy at all. We only talked at the gym but not every day texting. 

In January we both confessed feelings and things were going great. 
Well april 13‚Ä¶we both had an argument and neither of us reached out. Honestly it just felt like we both were just not interested in pursuing something further or at least try to work it out. 

We lost contact for 3 weeks then he texted me to ask me how I was doing. He told me he got an eye infection And chatted for a bit. He said he‚Äôs been dealing with heavy stress. We only interchanged like 10 texts. The last thing he said was that I am a very special person in his life and will always be here for me.

Another 2 weeks passed (which was yesterday) he texts me again and asked me how I was doing. He told me he just wanted to check up on me and make sure I am doing well. Again, he says‚Ä¶.‚Äùyou‚Äôre a very special to me and you have been wonderful to me‚Äù I said thank you (followed by his name) he said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not (insert name)‚Äù I was confused and he follows with ‚ÄúI‚Äôm dorito‚Äù so that‚Äôs the nickname I had given him. 

He asked me if I was at work. I said I wasn‚Äôt because I have the stomach flu. He then face timed me and starts telling me he hopes I get better and to drink lots of fluids to prevent dehydration‚Ä¶.he sounded genuine with his advice. 

Before I hung up, he threw a kiss with his hands towards the screen.

dating,1426q5d,1686034175.0,Was I in a textuationship?,"I answer calls at work and there was a girl whose calls I‚Äôd always get. Well one day she randomly messaged me and after that it was everyday about anything and every thing. I felt a little weird about making a friend like that at work but we had a lot in common and I was always smiling. She had a girlfriend at the time which I was respectful but they broke up. Up until then we hadn‚Äôt met even though at work we‚Äôre on neighbor buildings and we had been messaging for a year. Looking back we met because I went to the fair to see her even though I was planning on going a different day. she never had the intention of meeting me which I understood when she was taken. After we met I started to visit her before she started work. I would give her little gifts like her favorite drinks and leave sticky notes. Every time we made plans she would cancel or ‚Äúforget‚Äù one time I was dressed and even got out of work early but she ditched me. The messaging eventually slowed down. During Christmas I bought this special edition jersey she wanted and I asked a few times when we could meet up but she was always too busy for me so I ended up keeping it. She knows I bought that for her and even then she never made the effort to make time. I wrote her a letter to confess my feelings and we continued to text for a few weeks until she texted me on new years eve to say she would never date me and that she was still single but seeing another girl and that I needed to respect their boundaries. Broke my heart the last day of the year. Not to mention i waited a few months after the break up to tell her I liked her because she was working on herself and didn‚Äôt want to date. When she said all that it left me confused and I felt like my heart was being ripped out because she had told me a few times that she would consider dating me if she was single and that I was an amazing girl. I have never dated anyone or gotten attention from someone and I was finally getting a little attention. Im not the girl people get crushed on. It makes me feel used like maybe she would only message me when she was at work bored. I guess delusional me thought I had a chance now I‚Äôm left still single and with a jersey for a sport I don‚Äôt even know anything about lol

One time she wanted a hat and there was a coupon to drop it from 40 to $15 but it didn‚Äôt work. But I lied and said it worked for me and I edited the receipt so she would be happy that she got a 15 dollar cap but in reality I paid 40. I never told her that. 

All of this makes me feel really dumb and there‚Äôs no one I can talk to about this I can‚Äôt count the number of times i cried by myself about her. She still messages me but is she really my friend because it seems like she doesn‚Äôt want anyone in her life to know about me? I don‚Äôt know what I should do because I did so many things wrong and was stupid. We never talked about this in person and probably never will. Why does she continue to message me if she‚Äôs with someone else?",She just wants attention
dating,1426kwt,1686033773.0,"Talking about future, why?","Hi, 
So this is a bit of a random question but something in honestly curious about. Why do some men (and maybe women, but I don't date those, so don't know), so easily talk about future plans together (you shouldn't drive on our holiday together, if we get a dog you should be the one walking it), when we barely know each other (like between date 1-5)? I mean these are not big players or something (those aren't my type), but I have noticed this communication style more than once. 
I don't take it too seriously, it's just something I'm wondering about.","If someone was talking about our future between dates 1 and 5 I don't feel great about it. Look up the term ""future fakers"". It's a form of love bombing. 

I want to get to know someone first like who they really are and have some good conversations and let things build, sure share your values, past stories etc...  and start binding over mutual interest. Future talk that early seems a bit too advanced. A lot of people speak their fantasies out loud though whether they mean it or not and it is to build some kind of trust, but it is usually to just get you in to a false sense of quick intimacy with them. In my experience anyway, if I am reading your post correctly.

Lots of incongruent sorts out there so see if their words match their actions first. Don't be fooled by future talk!"
dating,1426bly,1686033038.0,Aquaintance and dating advices,"Hello guys. First time in here...I think this post will be a little long, but if you can help me I would be glad

I'm a 26 yo guy, got out of a long distance relationship like 4 months ago. I've been using Tinder, trying to go out with friends (too if this didn't work for some issues we had) etc, usual things someone who wants to meet people does.

One day I found an ""anonymous"" chat app, like you get in, you look for profiles and chat with them ""anonymously"". You can reveal yourself tho. Let's say that this app has some bad knowing for people who use it in a bad way, you can imagine the type of chats most of the guys are looking for on there.

Said this, I met a girl on there on last tuesday. We talked a bit, she seems a shy type, too if you take her in the right mood she just starts being nice and sweet. She's 20, I'm 26. I know we have different ways of thinking, but this won't stop me on asking her out or anything else.

The point is, we had a great week, talking about last week, we had fun in chat, we watched a movie together (if you can say together) and much more. I can feel good vibes between the two of us but I think I'm stuck in some way.

Having met eachother on that app makes me ""suspicious"", I mean, most of the guys on there treat you like shit, they don't care about the person who's on the other side etc.
I've been trying to show my real self and I think I did it pretty well, but now I don't really know how to keep going this.

Yesterday I thought about asking her out, we live 1 hour by car far. I thought about a nice date on the lake, we could go drink something and then just walk and be together. She obviously asked for more time to know eachother better, and I can't complain about that, since the reputation of the app.

I'm stuck because Idk how to carry on all of this, since I would like to meet her one day, but I'm scared I could be stuck in here forever...and I need to ""reset"" myself, since yesterday she was a little absent and I like missed her for half of the day. Maybe I already fucked up, but I would like what you guys think about all of this

If you have any other question just ask, I'll answer to them willingly","Just be wary that some people use these types of apps just to speak to someone to gain instant gratification with no intention of meeting up. Trust your intuition, of course, you can give it some time if that's what she's saying but I would also look at meeting other people and trying other ways."

We are over two thousand miles (and reuires a plane) apart. And our work schedules often clash. Yet somehow we managed to keep in contact regularly.

Nowadays i feel as though my advances at sexting aren't reciprocated and i asked if he's ok and he said he is. But he doesn't initiate any sexting or anything. I was sending him a couple of sexy but cute texts to which he responded he wasn't trying to get riled up at work. Fair enough because he can always change his mind. I guess I would've liked to know the boundaries before that moment? This isn't my first rodeo.

I apologized and even told him to let me know when he'd like me to be sexual so i could ensure his comfort. I respect him and i respect if he doesn't even want to be sexual. We are good friends so i don't mind going back to that. Especially if big feelings are involved.

I've run the possibility of him having no romantic feelings for me and as much as it hurts my heart, i will be accepting of that news when he lets me know. I'm a bit too nuerodivergent to catch hints nowadays. But i do know when I'm not getting that same energy or a matching energy back. 

Maybe he doesn't like the long distance?  Maybe he doesn't like me? I'm sure he's attracted to me because he's stated this before but i really like him and I'm afraid if i say just how much he will flee.

I've been on dates where I'm like, ""eh, not sure about that guy...maybe..."" and then he calls and we make a second date and this whole different guy shows up. Different clothes, different venue, different energy and the sense of compatibility improves.

Fast forward to December & we have been meeting everyday & hanging out every second of the day. Ofcourse the sexual tension between us kept growing till he eventually pulled a move & kissed me, all while hes still in his relationship. 3 weeks pass by & he ends his relationship & we start dating right away in 2022.

Our relationship continued to July before it ended in an argument. We have been fighting often at that point & in the middle of a conversation he pulls the ""we should end this"" card. He takes it back & starts to profusely apologize for it, but it was too late. Once i heard these words i stuck to my ego & decided to hold on tight to that decision he took & have him face its consequences.

We lightly kept contact all through the year & by January 2023 i had already began dating someone new which I informed my Ex about & he had someone else that there was something between them cooking. Fast forward a month & half in February, i leave my rebound relationship with the new guy & ask my Ex to get back with me. Few bumps along the road & we do get back together exclusively with the rule of that we will start dating till we finally get the hang of the relationship & feel that we know each other perfectly for us to make it official. 

Now to present time, yesterday we were speaking when i opened up to him about how i feel that he has been restricting himself from our connection & many inconsistencies started to show. He finally tells me that he has been considering a break up whenever we would argue or fight or just simply not be having a good day. I felt a very heavy weight getting placed on my heart. I love him alot & i dont want to ever lose him but i also want to protect myself just in case if he pulls a fast one like last time & just breaks up with me out of nowhere.

He mentioned that he will start therapy to fix our relationship as he sees that most issues & pressure that comes from this relationship is from his end & that he wants to fix it, but im scared. I spoke to him regarding therapy that whoever is giving him the session may suggest a break up or that maybe we just arent meant for one another. He assured me that then he would change his therapist since he will communicate with his therapist from the first session that he just wants me & wants to fix the relationship. Thus he expects the therapist to help him keep me & make him able to show love & be consistent as he finds that very difficult.

I suggested that we take some distance since im scared of the outcome & i dont want to build my hopes up for them to come crashing down on me if he ends the relationship. But he assured me that a break up isnt an option he has in mind & he even asked me to bare him just till he gets therapy & works his issues out.

Ill be honest & say that im someone who has always been in a relationship & i just grew up seeing love all around me, thus i really want to feel it too. While hes someone who grew up very independent & almost without any sense of love around him. Hes factual & im emotional, he would rather solve his issues right away while id rather cry about them first. Our love languages are also very different. I prefer physical contact & acts of love & he prefers communication & verbally including each other in conversations. His way of showing love to me is always preserved as the bare minimum.

Im not sure what to do anymore. Part of me wants to wait it out, & wait for him to get therapy & possibly get better in communication & dealing with our relationship. But another part just wants to end it to get some sense of control over this situation that i have zero control in. Its like im scared he would leave me thus id leave first. How should act in the future regarding all of this?","How long are you willing to put your life on pause for a potential outcome with him you have no idea if you'll actually get?

Let him go to therapy.

In the meantime, you should continue focusing on yourself, even if that means dating someone new."

dating,1423hin,1686025506.0,Can't Say She Doesn't Like Me but Can't Say She Doesn't?,"There's this woman (27F) I (32M) met a few months ago that I briefly dated and then had a pause with due to her not having the capacity. I politely gave her the space she requested, with this caveat that she would like to try again down the road. We have excellent chemistry but there were valid reasons stemming from mental health. 

Recently I checked in and discovered she is getting on pretty seriously with someone from her past. Someone she feels rather comfortable with. We had a conversation about how this happened and what prevented her from notifying me, and as it turns out, it's mostly a fear of new beginnings and trust in people.

I did the right thing and told her my door is open but we shall disconnect. So far I've kept things very clean and dignified.

What I'm confused about is during our last conversation where I was direct with her, I asked if she liked me and she told me she couldn't answer that out of respect for the person she's trying to make things work with. I let her know that she could say 'no' and that would be fine with me. 

I'm honestly not too concerned about the outcome, Im a big boy these days, but I am genuinely curious if anyone has said this or experienced it! Basically, can't say no I don't like you, and can't say I do, because feels it would betray the loyalty they have to someone. It's like saying 'I won't even entertain the idea's, but she settled for 'I could like you'.

Throughout this I found it funny and told her this is an ultimatum, you must choose, and she stuck to her answer. 

I imagine this is just someone keeping options open. Does anyone think it's valid to respond her way? Or at least, can you make sense of it for me? 

Thank you.",I think it's immature of you to put her in that position. She's not into you and is dating someone else. You are putting her into an awkward situation by asking such an awkward question. She doesn't want to come off rude so she is being polite as possible. Leave her alone.

I‚Äôve come to a realization that bored and that might be because we are too different. We have a good time and can laugh. We‚Äôve known a each other for some time and we were good as friends. So I decide where we go and I try to make the effort to have interesting topics like an interesting fact or a movie, etc. I love talking about movies). Just anything that triggers an intellectual convo. Most of the time his responses are lackluster and he rarely shows enthusiasm which makes me feel like I‚Äôm boring him with my nonstop talking about different things. When it comes to planning things I struggle with finding something he‚Äôll like. I like going to museums, nature centers, the woods, etc. I love the movie theater, trying new foods/recipes, reading/talking about books, playing board games, doing puzzles, and building Lego sets. I feel like this is ‚Äúlame‚Äù to him and he jokes about this but I think it‚Äôs the truth because he doesn‚Äôt do any of this. He‚Äôs into video games, anime, the gym, but interestingly he likes musicals and documentaries, which I like too. 

Aside from that he makes the same jokes, some sexual, and I‚Äôm just bored. I feel like this isn‚Äôt it and I keep thinking maybe I‚Äôm just overthinking all of this but I feel like when I hangout with him it‚Äôs as if I‚Äôm dragging him along. It‚Äôs makes me feel sad because I do best to show him I put the effort in and I enjoy spending time with him, but he never wants to give me any of his ideas. I‚Äôm kind of tired of trying. I even asked what days he‚Äôs off so I can think of doing something like rock climbing or something we‚Äôve never done before. This is how thoughtful I am.

dating,1421xya,1686021599.0,Do I tell my boyfriend my first love was a catfish?,"So to begin, I 25F and my 26M have been together for almost 3 years. We've talked about exes and past relationships but I haven't told him about the first time I fell in love. So let me tell you. 
I was 15, and I had a friend, let's call her Nora. Nora 16F had a boyfriend, let's call him Derek 16M. Nora and Derek met online and they had been talking for a few months. Nora introduced me to Derek (online) and we began talking. Nora and I lived across the globe, so we would always just call and talk to Derek. 

Spoiler alert: Derek is a catfish. But Derek did not present like one. Derek had pictures and videos with friends, friends who commented and friends with their own  profiles and pictures and hundreds of interactions with a bunch people. Derek had a brother who had pictures with derek and derek's friends and parents and everything. Derek had exes and girls who commented and messaged him. Derek seemed real. Who derek really is is yet to come in this post, stay tuned. Another spoiler: It's not an old man.

After almost a year of being friends with Derek, he and I entered into a long distance relationship **None of our interactions were sexual** . He and I talked day and night, exchanged pictures and had phone calls- but never video. I fell in love with derek. Pure and innocent love. After half a year of dating Derek, I find out that Derek is not real. Derek is a 15 year old girl from Canada. Let's call her Mandy. Mandy and her friends created dozens and dozens of facebook profiles based on real people and their real friends and family and played some sorta sims/ make believe game. They'd chat with each other via these fake profiles, they'd post pictures the actual people were posting and interact with them as if they were real. It was just a group of teenage girls having a weird querky hobby. Mandy and her friends revealed their true identities to me. Derek/Mandy told me all of this and how they had been active on these profiles for a few years. Derek was fake and I was heartbroken. I grieved Derek.  Mandy told me she was sorry and she never intended to hurt me or Nora or even the previous girl Derek catfished. Mandy and her friends were nice and they genuinely didn't seem malicious. I did develop a lot of trust issues after but that's besides the point.

It's a secret that I find embarassing and only my closest friends know. Do I tell my now boyfriend- who I am in a very serious relationship with about Derek?","They didn‚Äôt seem malicious? That is 100% malicious! Everything they did was with the intent to lie and deceive not only you but other people for a long period of time! And they went to great lengths to deceive you!

Met each others parents and stuff like that. Since we are minors we obviously have yet to do very intimate stuff but we have kissed and show physical affection.

In very few minor cases this type of relationship survives.

I [25] went on a first date with this girl [24] a week ago and it went really well. We talked for hours at a farmers market and then she basically invited herself over to my place and we watch some shows. I ended up driving her back home and we texted after we had a great time and we would plan something for the following week. I start making plans a couple days later and she suddenly says she has some big work thing due on Monday and is too overwhelmed. That's fine I say and we go about the week. We text a few times (she even initiates) sprinkled in about random stuff but nothing too much to give her mental space. 

Anyway I'm about to go on a trip for a week so I asked her if she's doing anything tomorrow after work before I go and she literally says she has a doctor's appointment for a physical. First of all, there's no way there's a single office open after 5pm she could go to, let alone would take up all her free time after work. I kind of can't believe how bad of an excuse that was. I'm pretty much ready to burn the bridge, she didn't even offer to meet another time. 

I guess I just don't understand the mentality of her still talking to me when she's clearly not interested. Then again, it's only been like 8 days since we met so maybe I'm overreacting and too eager.

Skipping the really heavy stuff, I bounced back EXTREMELY tough. Its been an eventful year and 3 months or so. But man, I just keep crushing myself. There‚Äôs stuff in my life that‚Äôs got me a little down, and there‚Äôs absolutely some wounds I‚Äôm still healing from.

The idea of dating someone again is more terrifying than exciting. Due to my love for music and wanting to go pretty hard with it despite earning no money from it (Thats death metal, baby, ain‚Äôt no real money to be made here) and me not having the greatest time management skills/being very hard on myself, and a job i have to learn for often, I just can‚Äôt seem to shake the feeling that my next relationship will fail. I worry ill not have time or focus to make it work, or the usual voice in my head telling me I‚Äôm not shit and never will be takes over in grand fashion. 

Due to related and non-related reasons, my last relationship‚Äôs end was absolutely devastating. But I know getting hurt or stuff not working out again is definitely possible, and there‚Äôs no way to know unless I just send it. Though a calculated send, of course. I‚Äôm having a hard time going through with it knowing that.

Other pertinent info: I primarily used dating apps because if we‚Äôre meeting up, it means youve read my bio and know what im looking for, saw my face/body in different contexts, and have decided it was worth it to meet. It takes tons of pressure off.

But dating apps are pure shit now. Fuck. In-person game is awful. I usually end up having to drink enough beer to drown a small flyover state in to get the courage up, and thats not how i wanna be.

Anybody else overcome something similar or have any advice to share? Given all factors, I‚Äôm definitely not feeling very confident anymore.","I‚Äôm starting to hear more and more about women‚Äôs insanity on these apps (for reference I am a woman who does use these apps).

My boyfriend bought me tickets to see my favorite artist and an hotel  because by the time I‚Äôve moved into my own apartment I barely had any money left to wipe my ass with a towel then, a few days later, he had gotten into a fatal car accident where he was the only survivor. 

He doesn‚Äôt talk much about it, but I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs taken a toll on him mentally and due to the injuries he sustained during it, he missed out on work and that of course put a financial strain on him as well. As for me I missed 2 days of work to be by his side and take care of him, I even helped him shower and feed him while I knowingly had my own responsibilities I had to take care of like rent, Wi-Fi and etc. 

Once my check came in, I spent it all on my bills and Afterpay the gifts that I could‚Ä¶

Fast forward to now, upon our first discussion of his birthday he through a fit because he seen a problem with me wanting to celebrate at my apartment. I didn‚Äôt tell him what I was gonna do because it was a surprise, but ideally due to my financial situation I was gonna decorate my apartment with roses, balloons, bag his gifts and cook him his favorite meal. I even have lingerie and a spicy game lined up. 

As of today, his birthday is tomorrow and he had hurt my feeling because I offered cheap entertainment and alcohol until his day and he simply responded ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not staying in the house drinking on my birthday,‚Äù hurt I didn‚Äôt say much. I took a shower and cried a little because I felt like I was disappointing him even before he knew what I had planned. Because I am the type to shut down during the argument I made sure to take the time feel my emotions and address him after. When I came back he was unaware of my hurt feelings and I tried to sit down and talk about how what he said made me feel. 

He stated I took it out of context and got mad and said I was making my birthday about him and making stuff up in my head and that he was saying he didn‚Äôt have a problem with staying in, he just wasn‚Äôt gonna drink. But I knew what he was saying ‚Äî before giving up on the conversation explained that maybe I am making things up and still hurt about his prior words so what he said rubbed me the wrong way and just being would‚Äôve liked some reassurance. He said he wasn‚Äôt go comfort me because ‚ÄúI‚Äôm making things up in my head.‚Äù

I simply decided to just leave the apartment and catch some air. Any advice on what to do next? Or how to move forward. Because I‚Äôm honestly ready to send him home and see him when I get paid on Thursday.","I will play devil's advocate here for a moment - your boyfriend did go through a traumatic experience and is likely secretly feeling vulnerable and coping right now by this abrasive behavior. But even so, his behavior towards you is NOT right, and it isn't justified. ""It's in your head"" is a total red flag phrase.

That said, I think you guys can work this out IF he can have accountability for his part and acknowledge and validate your feelings. He may have a wall up of anger and upsetness right now, but you'd be surprised what a simple sweet, non-judgmental, we're-on-the-same-team/ I-don't-want-to-fight-with-you aura can do. Try leading with that, make it a safe space for discussion, and try to talk through the miscommunication. That's what this is a miscommunication - you had a sweet surprise planned for his birthday, he didn't know about it and is being defensive by being combative.

I'd say give it a shot, but also he needs to be mature and be able to eventually talk things out with you, talk about his feelings, in an open and loving manner. Give him a chance, give him some time and space if he needs it, I'd say follow-through on the birthday plans IF you're up for it emotionally, BUT you do eventually have to call it if he doesn't come around and be an emotionally mature and attentive partner.

At the end of the day, your feelings are completely valid, and you're SUPER sweet for doing these things for him, you didn't do anything wrong.

Also, did he usually get like this before the car accident? I realize most of my advice above is null and void if so"

In my opinion once you‚Äôve decided someone is your life partner that‚Äôs when you get *engaged*, boyfriend/girlfriend are for when you‚Äôre serious about someone you‚Äôre dating.

I won‚Äôt tell my whole life story on this post but I will give some context on why I feel lonley and sad. For as long as I can remember, I felt different then everyone else. I was a very goofy and nerdy for lack of a better word kid. I loved things like Spongebob, Harry Potter and Yu Gi Oh ect and went through phases where I was OBSESSED with them. for a few years in high school I tried to be ‚Äúcool‚Äù and was into rap and stuff like that but that got me absolutley nowhere so I just went back to being myself and for the past few years I got obsessed with anime and games things like that.

Anyways I don‚Äôt even think that‚Äôs very important it‚Äôs just a part of who I am because despite the fact that I hide these things and hide that I am insecure about my weight (that truthfully isn‚Äôt even awful it‚Äôs not like I weigh 400 pounds and I try my hardest to manage it) and try to talk to people I always feel rejected by society. I had one girlfriend ever and she is pretty much all I ever had you know what with. She ended up leaving me for someone else and she wasn‚Äôt even all that because she would make fun of my family and even said that I had autism because of my interests. 

I get called a nice guy all the time or funny and yeah I guess I am THAT guy but is there a way for me to ever not get stuck in that position? Yes I secretly have One Piece Posters and a PS5  in my room and I live with my Mom, I know those aren‚Äôt chick magents but I have a job now that I go to every day and try hard at, yet after work when all I want is even a buddy to go hit the beach or grab a beer with like most ‚Äúnormal‚Äù people do I just sit in my lonlieness wondering why the only people that text me is my cousin and Mom and why I get 0 match on all the dating sites I try. 

Does anyone have advice for a guy like me? I have fake confidence and make people laugh but when it comes down to it I have no game and i‚Äôm not sure why because I like to think i‚Äôm decent looking, I take care of myself and have good hygiene, and I TRY with girls whenever I can and don‚Äôt feel like they are giving me a dirty look before I even approach them, and I have a good head on my shoulders with the job and all even if I come across as a little silly sometimes and can‚Äôt help it. 

Thank You for listening","I think the number one thing to do is to keep leaning into what makes you feel like yourself. Keep up with your hobbies and what makes you feel good and what makes you feel like yourself.

Also - Own. Your. Shit.
It literally doesn't matter what's mainstream popular (besides the stuff you're into is pretty popular anyways) and there will always be someone out there who thinks exactly what you like is super cool. It is so sexy to just own who you are, what you like, and what you bring to the table.

No matter what your weight, be SUPER into hygiene and putting in effort. Do some heavy research and do what you can to maximize in that department.

I'd recommend first making some friends and gaining your confidence, pamper yourself with what you need. While annoyingly SO difficult to research and stumble upon the right groups, join a bunch of meetup/ interest groups until you find the *right* people to be friends with.

Also, for the ladies, a heart of gold shines in the dark. When the *right* girl comes around, that is what will matter to her. Be prepared to show her your good character and put effort into treating her right - expect the same in return.

In the end, work on being a person you're proud of and then it's a numbers game until you find the right people. I emphasize the *right* people - better to be alone than being with shitty people

Good luck, don't give up!"

I started thinking about logistics if this is still going strong when he moves. He'll be gone at least a year, 1 hour flight/7 hour drive away, and I'm willing to move after a year when my job contract ends. However, it seems crazy to enter into an LDR after such a brief relationship (we did know each other for a few months prior).. But I also know multiple successful couples who started their relationships as long-distance (though most of this was during peak pandemic).

Has anyone entered into an LDR soon after starting a relationship, and how did it go? What are pitfalls you might experience from entering one so soon? Did you feel like there was enough of a foundation so early on to continue on in the LDR? When did you bring it up to the other person- a friend told me to avoid bringing it up for now so as not to put ""pressure"" on things, and re-address closer to the move.","While I agree that having a strong foundation is important for an LDR, I also think that given that the distance is relatively short and you have an end date in mind, you can make it work.

So multiple times now I've had matches where I talked to the girl for a week or so. Sometimes longer. We exchange numbers, sometimes we just keep it on the app at that phase. Whatever feels right.

Anyway, we will get to the point where we're having fun conversations, as stated the replies are pretty quick back and forth, joking, flirting, at times more serious subjects etc. 

I have no problem asking a girl out if I truly like her. So usually I'll throw out having a phone conversation or actually meeting up for a cup of coffee or whatever it seems like she may like. Just to keep the process moving if anything.

Multiple times they will commit, I will tell them I'm looking forward to it. It's all good.

Then I will get a wall of text about how they have anxiety and hate situations like this, not ready to date, haven't dated much at all. Whatever the excuse may be. 

Some of these have actually happened on paid dating apps. It's one thing to ditch somebody, and I understand people talk to more than one person on there, I do that. (Still haven't figured out why anyone would be on a paid dating app and flake out)

Whenever a woman says this to me, I never push it. I never call them names or tell them I feel screwed over I just say okay and unmatch them. Because after they say that my attraction level to them drops to pretty much 0%. We all have anxiety, it's the wasted time that changes my opinion. 

I'm not asking for solutions, because I don't know what anybody would really do other than keep trying. But just trying to create a discussion and see if anybody else out there has encountered this.

If you're not interested in pursuing things, please just tell me that you didn't feel a connection, and we can both move on!

Hello, coming in with a strange request. While scrolling through potential matches, I came across a friend of my older brother. Growing up he would hang out at the house, came on a few family vacations, but I was always the annoying little sister. Rightfully so. So the friend is now divorced and my mother made some comment a while ago like ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt you date him?!‚Äù Umm I dunno mom, because I haven‚Äôt spoken to him in 20 years, and he‚Äôs my brother‚Äôs friend. The truth is, I always kind of liked him. I know my brother wouldn‚Äôt have it though. So now here I sit. I feel bad for hitting the ‚ÄúX‚Äù on his profile, but if I hit the ‚ÄúLike‚Äù button, that‚Äôs equally as awkward. I thought about sending a message with something clever like ‚Äúwell, meeting the family wouldn‚Äôt be weird.‚Äù Does anyone have any experience with this?","Depending on the app you could just close the app and it would likely switch to other people without you doing anything, then he may eventually come across your profile and take the lead.

However, as a 32F, I‚Äôm also sensitive to that movie stereotype that if I ask about marriage or kids I come off as desperate / always the bridesmaid energy. 

I‚Äôm wondering if this community can offer some examples on how to phrase these interests that are inviting to conversation.

I've been seeing a guy for a couple weeks and it's going great. He's flying out today to go back home (out of state) for a few weeks. I was planning to wait to have sex with him until after he came back, but earlier this week he took me out on a great ""good-bye"" date before his trip and everything just felt right so I went for it. I felt like we bonded more and I was feeling more emotionally connected. He spent the night but had to be up early for work.

The next night I went out with a friend and texted him  before bed. Yesterday (Thursday) I still hadn't heard back all day which was unusual. I was feeling kind of anxious. Yes, I've done a lot of work on my attachment style but the early dating stages are still wobbly for me. 

I was starting to wonder if we had sex too soon or if I was going to get ghosted. I finally decided, ""Eff this double texting nonsense"" and just sent him a message on my lunch break saying I hope he was having a good day. He responded enthusiastically and I told him in a flirty way that I missed his morning text. He then responded that he had sent me one at 7 am and sent a screen shot. I never got it! My phone must have eaten it. üòÑ We chatted a bit and he told me packing went super fast and asked if I was up for a spontaneous dinner that night! He came over and took me out and we had another amazing night together and got closer too. I told him I had been feeling a little anxious earlier when I hadn't heard from him and he confessed he had been too. Lol. 

Big lesson for me here is to be bold, be vulnerable, and don't overthink texting. I'm really glad I didn't play some texting standoff game."
datingoverthirty,1455g93,1686317715.0,Reddit Protest - r/DatingOverThirty is participating,"Cheers DOT folks. 

The mod team has been discussing the upcoming Reddit protest all week, and as several of you have requested updates via ModMail, we thought we'd share our decision with the community. We wanted to discuss these matters internally ourselves first, to make sure we were on the same page before we made any sort of announcement. 

**TL/DR: DOT goes private from June 12th through 14th. Mods on vacation. Mayhem ensues.**

By now I suspect most have heard about the [open letter](https://old.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/13xh1e7/an_open_letter_on_the_state_of_affairs_regarding/) and API pricing. Even if it doesn't affect you directly, it will impact many of the ways Reddit currently functions. If you are not sure what this even is, I direct you to some folks who explain it far better than I could. In an easy way to understand, this is [what API is](https://old.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/10rnu6s/eli5_how_does_an_api_work/) and [why this is change is a problem](https://old.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/142kct8/eli5_why_are_subreddits_going_dark/). r/AskHistorians explains in detail why [so many Mods are upset, disillusioned and/or angry, in the wake of the Admin announcement.](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/142w159/askhistorians_and_uncertainty_surrounding_the/)

To a lot of people, the API changes are not a big deal and might not be noticed. If you use the official app and it works for you, that‚Äôs great. You may not have known that third party apps existed, or why people prefer them. Some of our Mod team do use third party apps, both for casual browsing and for moderation. Others don‚Äôt. For us, this is not just about our personal preferences; it is about standing in opposition to ableism and making sure others have a voice.

[Latest updates](https://old.reddit.com/r/redditdev/comments/144l86y/takeaways_and_recommendations_after_api_meeting/)

If you‚Äôre thinking ""These apps make a profit, so they should share some with Reddit,"" we absolutely agree! The issue many users have is the prices. It's near 10-20x more than similar services which means these apps will have to shut down. 
[Apollo](https://old.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/13ws4w3/had_a_call_with_reddit_to_discuss_pricing_bad/) has been the scapegoat in some ways, but [Narwhal](https://old.reddit.com/r/getnarwhal/comments/13xskqh/narwhal_update_about_reddit_api_pricing/), [Relay](https://old.reddit.com/r/RelayForReddit/comments/13wsn92/guess_this_is_also_the_death_of_relay/), [RIF](https://old.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/13wxepd/rif_dev_here_reddits_api_changes_will_likely_kill/), [BaconReader](https://old.reddit.com/r/baconreader/comments/13wveb2/reddit_api_changes_and_baconreader/), [Boost](https://old.reddit.com/r/BoostForReddit/comments/13xzap9/can_you_plz_release_the_material_update_since/jmmuslx/) and [Slide](https://old.reddit.com/r/slideforreddit/comments/141rpcf/slide_will_be_dead_in_the_water_in_less_than_four/) have all issued statements that they are shutting down. 

Before you ask ‚Äúwhy can‚Äôt they just run ads to cover costs‚Äù, Reddit has decided this will not be an option. Even if a third party app manages to survive July 1st through a subscription based model alone, those apps will not have all the same content as the Official App. Namely, despite paying for the privilege of having a choice, NSFW content will be unavailable and invisible to those users. 

**WHAT THIS MEANS TO YOU**

Most mods use third party apps because the tools are light years better, and we're not swamped with ads. Despite the hate mail we get, us mods generally don't live in your mom's basement but have full time jobs, families and mod on our lunch breaks, after hours or other free time. We do this work because we care about the community. The switch forcing moderators to use the official app would slow down moderation and force more of the work to happen on desktop. That means your posts and comments will sit in queue unseen longer, it will take longer to get back to modmails, and harmful/illegal content or users may remain visible and unbanned for longer. In discussions with other mods, these changes will probably cripple most NSFW content on the website.  On a third party app, we can accomplish in two clicks what would take the Official App five. Though Reddit has made strides in improving them, there is a long way to go. Even with uBlockOrigin and my mobile browser it's tough to mod. Plus you should be aware that Reddit has already been testing functions [which eliminate mobile web browsing](https://old.reddit.com/r/help/comments/135tly1/helpdid_reddit_just_destroy_mobile_browser_access/jim40zg/), and there is no guarantee that your preferred method of using Reddit won‚Äôt be next. (Where my Old Reddit fans at?)

**FURTHER ISSUES**

Some people cannot use the official apps. Blind users especially (but others who need accessibility features) [may not be able to access Reddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/Blind/comments/13zr8h2/reddits_recently_announced_api_changes_and_the/) have challenges. For blind moderators, it can be difficult to impossible to find the moderation functions necessary, as well any layouts customizations necessary. This is the gap third party apps have happily stepped in to fill, and lived in harmony for years this way. These changes will also significantly impact volunteer run transcription subreddits, which allow visually impaired Redditors to read text images, and receive descriptions of visual content such as videos and images. These volunteers are indispensable to the blind community, because Reddit is the only social media website with no support for alternative text (though they may be working on that). Remember, NSFW content will be unavailable to regular users on third party apps, and yes, disabled people like porn too!

(NB: as of publishing this post - there is an article out on Verge from yesterday the that says Reddit will be making exceptions in the API policy for accessibility users, but no [details yet](https://old.reddit.com/r/Blind/comments/13zr8h2/reddits_recently_announced_api_changes_and_the/jnbkjed/). )

For many of us third party apps are just an option, but for some they are a necessity. We are of the opinion that pricing these apps out of existence before Reddit has a solution is passive discrimination. While there is much speculation why Reddit wants to take away the voices of those who are blind, or otherwise need accessibility or transcription accommodations, the plain fact is, that flies in the face of the tolerance and anti-discrimination the mod team here has always tried to stand up against. Limiting user choice, charging exorbitant and predatory fees, and refusing to communicate, are all significant problems that the mod team here takes issue with. We quietly have worked to make the sub more accessible (and would welcome [additional feedback via modmail](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fdatingoverthirty) if you have suggestions), so this is deeply disappointing to us. 

**SUMMARY**

We are prepared to remain blacked out for a minimum of 48 hours. This means that no one will be able to access any DOT content  until the blackout is over. In standing up for the voices of others, however, we don‚Äôt want to strip away the voices of our community. So now we want to hear from you.

datingoverthirty,144e14r,1686242088.0,How much influence does the past have on your mindset/dating choices?,"As i'm self reflecting and pondering, I realize that my past experiences have shaped who I am today, my opinions, my choices. My overall mindset comes from life experiences and lessons, professionally and personally. I don't think of myself as positive or negative, rather logical and calculated based on information. Touch a hot stove bare handed, not gonna do it again, right? Not gonna try again and hope for the best.

Professionally, my manager approached me with an opportunity that i've had before but was always passed over for in favor of less qualified people, which lead to me declining and basically saying ""not worth my time."" She pointed out that what happened in the past should not affect my choices today and to get out of that ""past mindset"". She has a point but also its discouraging to try and get the same outcome so eventually you just choose another path or stay the same.

Personally, my ex has accused me more than once of living in the past, with him specifically. He did alot of terrible things.. cheating, drinking,  lying, suicidal depression, etc. And while he improved significantly, even got sober, i never forgot and had to work through those feelings over the 4 months we tried reconciling after a long time apart. He accused me of not letting it go and ended up leaving me because of it. I doubt that 4 months is enough time to repair that damage but i realize i did hang onto alot of what happened, and acted accordingly. This experience has since made me reject people in sobriety, people with mental illness, i'm quick to reject the second one red flag might be waving even if its not. I learned to be pickier, but when is it TOO picky because I am living in 'the past'?

I'm just curious as to how your past, might affect your current dating choices or do you take on the mindset that the past is irrelevant to today? If so, HOW do you do that?!","Your ex labelled you as having a ""past mindset"" in order for you to feel guilty for having concerns about his issues and the terrible things he did. Don't buy into what he says about you.

When are you being TOO picky? There's no objective measure for this. You have to figure out what works for you. At the same time, you can't make decisions based out of fear. Think about what you've been through, what you learned, what you want, your boundaries and deal breakers and go from there. 

In terms of the job, if you don't think the job is a right fit for you, then don't take it. That doesn't necessarily mean you're stuck in the past."

I‚Äôve (34F) mostly had tumultuous, dramatic and passionate relationships that burn hot and heavy and fizzle out when they get past about 1.5 years. I have grown to expect the holding my breath, waiting for the shoe to drop, responding accordingly to whatever shoe drops, extremely passionate and hot and heavy makeups, and so on. (Ex: cheating, sneaky with phones, flaky, lies, grand gestures to ‚Äúfix it,‚Äù wild sex, etc.). 

I‚Äôve spoken with other friends and heard ‚Äúyou‚Äôll know if you‚Äôre compatible once you have that major blow up - screaming, fighting, slamming doors.‚Äù It always sounded like an unhealthy measure - I had ENOUGH of that growing up with an addict for a sibling. I don‚Äôt want to communicate that way with anyone OR have anyone communicate that way with me. My partner (M40) agrees with me on that.

Fast forward to my current relationship with (6+ months, started a couple week trial in April with living together before his lease is up in fall and have been together ever since). FWIW, we live an hour+ apart, but met just prior to my move. The moving in was fast and convenient, but we both discussed with our therapists and family and decided a trial was smart. I digress. 

In this relationship, it feels the opposite of my previous experience. He feels like a partner, we take care of each other, we‚Äôre kind, honest, playful and deeply connected. Sex is good and regular (1-2xs a day), albeit a bit more vanilla than what I‚Äôd probably want long term. We‚Äôve discussed it and he‚Äôs aware and agreed to try some new things.

datingoverthirty,1441pxl,1686206814.0,Has anyone gotten into a relationship that started with lovebombing?,"This is kind of a follow up to my previous post about someone who talks too much about themselves: 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/13y9yct/dates\_who\_talk\_too\_much\_about\_themselves/](https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/13y9yct/dates_who_talk_too_much_about_themselves/)

It turns out the date I was referring to actually *was* a narcissist and he proceeded to lovebomb the shit out of me. I fell for it for a couple of days because I was loving the attention, etc, but when the tell-tale lovebombers ""whirlwind"" died down for a day or two my therapist told me exactly what was going on and I ended things immediately.  

I can understand how it's really easy to get into a relationship with someone like this who is making you feel like the most special person in the world, despite showing no signs of actually caring about you (thus the never inquiring about me, my feelings, etc) or even knowing you at all. I guess the reason is to lock someone down in order to control them. 

So I'm curious - has anyone here ever gotten into a relationship with someone who was lovebombing them? How did that turn out for you? Or maybe you got into a relationship with someone who was just excited and infatuated. If so, how did you know the difference?","I am in a relationship with someone who was really excited and infatuated.  As in showing way more interest than I had experienced in the puppy-love times of high school.  And while I was also really interested in her from the start (ended my other match with someone who was also clearly interested in me because the prospect of a date with my now-partner was just so much more appealing I didn't want to be distracted), she at all times seemed at least a tiny bit more interested in me than I in her.

While I'm a believer in going exclusive sooner than later, third date seemed the time to ask that; she asked for exclusive on our first date.  And at the end of out first date, she didn't want to end the date without us having our second date setup (and all other dates, if we didn't already have a ""next time"" we'd agree on that before separating for the night).

And having been reading the reddit dating subs, all her signs of high interest, along with this being so out of the norm of my (admittedly limited) experience; I watched closely that this wasn't just words of extravagance, future faking, or first stages of love bombing.

But she respected my boundaries.  If she wanted to get together at time X, and I said I had other plans, she never asked me to cancel on them.  She kept up her life that didn't involve me; e.g. she was busy sometimes and didn't offer to cancel on them (and no, I wasn't asking for that).  When she wanted to plan out a vacation (vacations are Her Thing^(TM)), she asked about my comfort level of planning it, as we'd been together \~3 weeks and it would be for a period 3 months later when she had a long custody break without her kid.  I.E. she didn't just plan it and force her gift upon me.

And along the lines of that vacation, because it was so far out, we agreed on how tickets/reservations/etc would be handled if we weren't together.  She accepted that while she really hoped we'd still be together, but at 3 weeks together we were both still leaning about the other and growing/opening up still.  I can't believe that a love bomber would even open themselves up to that possibility.

We had started talking **a lot** on OkCupid.  As in together we wrote about 21k words to each other over 8 days.  That was about a 50/50 split; maybe 55/45 me to her.  After our first date we discussed that level of text communication wasn't sustainable.  We agreed on text for time-sensitive messaging, and messenger (which we didn't get alerts for) for non-time sensitive stuff.  We agreed that we'd want to send at least a few messages per day if we weren't together, but it would be at more of a convenience / best effort.

In short, she was a sane person, considerate of my boundaries, and care taking of her own life.  She just quickly saw that she really, really wanted to be with me and was not at all afraid to let me know.  After about a month I stopped going over everything with a fine tooth comb looking for problems in her high interest.

For someone else going through a similar thing, I would say pay attention to how they handle your boundaries.  How they handle you seeing friends, or generically being ""busy.""  How they handle hearing, ""No.""  If they just do grand gestures rather than ensure that you're OK with that.  If they can handle a sane level of communication that might mean a draw back from an initially high level.  If they actually follow through on their plans, whether it's something in 2-3 weeks, or 3 months away."

datingoverthirty,143o1ge,1686169808.0,Slow to warm up to people?,"(Posted this on the daily thread a while ago and it seemed like a lot of people wanted answers, so copying over my comment here - hopefully people can chime in with some positive and constructive advice :))

Is there anyone else here who just takes a super long time to warm up to people?

Even if I meet someone I like IRL, even if I can tell I'm attracted to them right away, it's still going to take several meetings before I can say I definitely like them. And that's when it's IRL and there is already some shared context to go on. On apps, everything feels so accelerated and I'm just like... hey dude, we are strangers. You do not know me. I get super uncomfortable with the play acting ""dating"" from day 1, like, I really want to just be able to accept that we are complete strangers and take our time before deciding what's happening here. No need to text every day or send kissy faces like we're already in a relationship...! And I don't like physical touch/kissing with people I'm not sure I have a crush on tbh. I don't think their behavior is authentic either (they barely know me).

I have a sense that I could try to communicate this up front (I always put this in my profile already that I want to take things slow, but it doesn't seem to make a difference) - the issue is kind of that if the other person sets the tone of ""dating"" right away (which most people do), then it's hard to tell them to back off to ""just friends"" until I'm ready. I feel the pressure of knowing that they're waiting for me to make up my mind & not waste their time.

This seems completely incompatible with dating apps and is really stressful for me. I know about demisexuality and I figure I'm probably somewhere in that spectrum, but knowing this has not really helped me at all because it still is what it is. I don't think that changing my personality or forcing myself to open up faster is really an option (I've tried). Does anyone have advice on navigating this?

Some friends of mine have said ""you can just hang out casually for a while until you figure it out!"" but these friends were on dating apps like 8+ years ago, and I feel like the culture doesn't really allow this anymore. I can empathize too - I don't want to spend hours hanging out with strangers on the off chance that they'll warm up to me in the end!

I guess my personality is more likely to be compatible with the ""meeting through hobbies/friends"" strategy, but unfortunately that strategy hasn't resulted in a lot of options for me, so I feel like I have to make it work with the apps somehow! Appreciate any advice.","I feel the same way these days. In my 20s, I was way more prone to jumping into things and going way too fast, but as I have thankfully grown and matured a bit I‚Äôm more able to take a grounded approach and not get carried away with literal strangers. 

It is kind of a blind date, if not an actual pretend date. I think my best advice would be to treat getting to know strangers off the apps as a hobby in and of itself while actually having your real hobbies. I mean people skills are a legit hobby. And it absolutely makes sense that it would take like 3 dates or more to accurately gauge your interest in someone, that‚Äôs the norm. 

Honestly it probably works in your favour because I don‚Äôt imagine you would come on too strong. My suggestion would be to meet as many people as possible that you think you might be interested in and let the ones that stand out to you naturally catch your interest over time."
datingoverthirty,143frtz,1686150506.0,"I don't know what to do anymore, thinking about breaking but I honestly don't want to.","Some background information: My partner Tom (fake name) (M28) and I (F31) have been dating for ten months now. We became exclusive after a couple of weeks, he confessed that he was in love with me after two months and a few months after that, we told each other that we love each other. 
We met through OLD almost three years ago and dated for 2-3 months, but it wasn't the right time. We separated on good terms and agreed that we would see each other again sometime, but when he texted me a couple of months later, I just got back in touch with my ex. My ex and I got back together and dated for 1,5 years and broke it off pretty amicable. Coincidentally, Tom texted me a few days after that breakup. Of course I told him about my situation, but we agreed to catch up and sparks were flying. We started dating soon after. Sometimes it was pretty difficult because I was also processing the breakup, but he was super supportive, kind and patient. (The first breakup with this ex was horrible, this time it wasn't nearly as painful, it definitly felt like the right choice, so the breakup process wasn't that difficult this time.)

Now to my dilemma. I love Tom. This guy has so many green flags; his communication skills are wonderful, he's super empathetic, he takes care of himself mentally and physically, he's super nice and supportive towards his friends and family, his hobbies and skills are very interesting, he met almost all my friends and they really like him and I honestly can't imagine a better or healthier sex life. I think we are a great match and so does he and I know he loves me very much. The way he looks at me is so loving and pure and he makes me feel loved and amazing.

The problem is that he doesn't like labels and has some avoidant attachment style tendencies. In December I concluded that I was done with my breakup process and was ready to fully open my heart to Tom (if I hadn't already) and wanted to make it official. I thought he didn't ask me yet because he wanted to give me enough time and space. Since he already confessed his love to me and we've been seeing each other every week and texting every day, I thought this was a done deal.
But to my surprise he told me that he wasn't really ready for it yet, he was afraid that the label boyfriend/girlfriend would maybe change things. He also told me he realised that the construction of our relationship doesn't really differ from an ""official"" relationship and that he would probably feel more at ease with those labels soon. No biggie, I thought. He's been super thoughtful and patient with me, things are great, it's okay if we continue like this. Two months later I bring if up again. The answer is pretty much the same. I start to get anxiety. You can probably guess where this is going; we're still not officially together and I've reached the point where I'm having anxiety and intrusive thoughts almost every day. We've talked about it a lot in the past few weeks and both cried over it together. He feels super guilty about it. I want to know if this is a sustainable relationship, I want to fantasize about the future together with him, I want to make plans. I want him to be enthusiastic about hopefully spending a long time with me. He on the other hand lives from day to day, which I honestly admire since my head is often stuck in the past or future, but this... This just doesn't work for me. He doesn't like to think about the future, he doesn't like to plan out his life (in every aspect). I'm feeling so sad. I know it has nothing to do with me, I get enough confirmation to believe that. Before this I thought, when I reach the point where I feel predominantly anxious or sad, I should break it off. And now I'm realising I've come to that point... but damnit I don't want to break it off! I hate this alternative! But the current situation isn't working for me either. I don't know what to do anymore. He's coming over tomorrow and I guess I just have to tell him what I'm writing here... Any advice is greatly appreciated.

Honestly, I wish I was more like him. What we have is amazing and it's basicly a fullblown relationship, except for the labels and future perspective (we do make short term plans, like traveling and events that are months away). But I need stability and confirmation. I want to make future plans.

If this doesn't work out, honestly I'm done with love and relationships (I know that's not true and it's just me being self destructive but uuuugggghhh).

EDIT: it's getting late and I'm off to bed, I don't think I can reply to every comment since I've recieved a lot of them, but I really appreciate all of you sharing your thoughts. I've reached a crossroad and I have a lot to think about, this thread is really helping me a lot, thank youüíö","I‚Äôm so sorry, this situation must be super hard for you. But honestly, even if he has all the green flags in the world, if he doesn‚Äôt want to commit to you (for whatever reason) after this long, he is not the right man for you, as sad as that is. You deserve someone who is able and willing to go all in with you."

datingoverthirty,142xgrk,1686095714.0,How to turn down an ex?,"UPDATE: I declined the meet up and told him I‚Äôm glad to hear he has been well and to take care. I blocked immediately afterwards. 

Hey, I had an ex that I‚Äôm not friends with but don‚Äôt hate reach out recently. It was the normal ‚Äúhow have you been?‚Äù type conversation and he has asked me out. I was open to it because, like I said, I dont hate the guy. We did have fun and could‚Äôve been friends, but I‚Äôve also grown a lot personally and professionally since back then and I am not sure that he has. Either way, he asked me out and suggested a time when I‚Äôm not available. When I told him he didn‚Äôt respond for a few days and then came back and suggested a rain check‚Ä¶ how he did it was odd. He was like ‚Äúso are you ever going to hang out with me?‚Äù It felt like negging. He also suggested the rain check for the same time I‚Äôm unavailable! I explained why I can‚Äôt/would rather not meet up and he kept coming back with work around despite me offering another day when I would be available. I have some work obligations (done remotely) and he was making accommodations for me to have computer access during the day/meet up he suggested and it was just weird. Inthe end I told him when I was available and let him know that if that doesn‚Äôt work for him then I understand. Then he finally suggested my first available time. 

The issue is, idk if I want to go or not now that I‚Äôve agreed to. I feel like a heel for it, but it‚Äôs how I feel. In the past after our break up he has reached out and invited me over to hang out. I was stupid and thought it was sincere but he tried to make a sexual advance on me while hanging out and we didn‚Äôt talk for years. I felt like he was trying to hook up knowing that I wasn‚Äôt interested. I‚Äôm aware that me agreeing to go to his house could be mixed signals but I feel like my word should stand alone. That really left a bad taste in my mouth at the time but this is years ago. However, he did make a comment about ‚ÄúI‚Äôd invite you over but I don‚Äôt want you to get the wrong idea about my intentions.‚Äù That felt like an unnecessary announcement and felt sus. 

I honestly don‚Äôt know where this came from or why he wants to see me unless he‚Äôs between girlfriends or the person he is seeing is out of town and he is bored. I have no clue. It‚Äôs been years since I‚Äôve seen him. 

I don‚Äôt know if I am just being a bitch about it for no reason just because he is an ex or if my gut feeling that this is sus and the same old song and dance with him. Texting him it didn‚Äôt seem like anything has changed for the better with him personality-wise or in any way. I also am really in a groove where I am enjoying being single and not dating. My kids, friends, hobbies, work really fulfill me right now. I don‚Äôt feel the need to seek out or feel any interest in dating or expanding my social circle. The thought of even having anyone in my home or my bed really turns me off. So idk if I am feeling hesitant because of that. 

I‚Äôve heard if it‚Äôs not a hell yes then it‚Äôs a hell no, but I‚Äôve also heard to put yourself out there and be open to the possibility of a pleasant surprise. So I don‚Äôt know if I need to just cancel or go with it.

datingoverthirty,142s4cu,1686082965.0,"Not sure whether to continue seeing this guys, need help.","Hey guys, need a little input as i keep going back and forth in my head. 

So, me (31) and this guy (40) went on our first date 7 weeks ago. We‚Äôve had lovely dates, and have a nice connection. Had sex on our 5th date and the connection there is great. 
Since early on he‚Äôs text me every morning and we texted throughout the day and often said night to each other. I felt if we continue like this we‚Äôll probably head into a relationship. 


After our 7th date he was away the next week for 5 days to visit family. He asked my availability earlier in the week but only asked to see me the morning of and I already committed to arrangements until 8pm, the only day I could do. I said I could see him after. He said that‚Äôs fine and said he‚Äôs doing a masters application so will see how he is. I finish up and ask how he‚Äôs doing and he says he hasn‚Äôt got enough done and feels like a zombie, said let‚Äôs catch up after he‚Äôs away. I was totally understanding but secretly a little upset as wanted to see him. Since then communication has been a slower, whilst he was away texting went to once/ twice a day. He‚Äôs come back and is texting more but still not as much as before. Checks in around lunch time now. Even though I didn‚Äôt ask he said he burned his lips so bad he is embarrassed to see me (also wouldn‚Äôt be able to kiss me). I thought fair enough but strange reason . Then the same day I had to go A&E and have been bed-bound for 4 days now. I‚Äôll get better soon but it‚Äôs been more than 2 weeks since we‚Äôve seen each other. 

I‚Äôve been really hesitant to ask him where we stand right now because of the distance. It might put pressure on things and we haven‚Äôt seen each other in a mighty long time. I‚Äôm just wondering whether he‚Äôs suddenly moving us into casual? I know there seems to be a reason, and it‚Äôs partly that I‚Äôm sick now but it‚Äôs creeping in that maybe he‚Äôs just not into me. He‚Äôs been lovely checking up on me and I kind of think why would he still initiate a conversation everyday.. but then another part of me says ‚Äúer for a hook-up‚Äù üòÇ He‚Äôs objectively a very attractive man, he wouldn‚Äôt struggle to find casual sex somewhere else but nothing surprises me anymore tbh! 

Just to note we haven‚Äôt had an exclusivity chat but he‚Äôs definitely not on 2 major dating apps (I checked because I‚Äôm nosy and a little unhinged). The one we met on we‚Äôre both on still but he hasn‚Äôt updated anything there. He is looking for a relationship and is open for children, so that i do know. 

Sorry this is long! I‚Äôm still in bed and my meds side effects have done a number on me üòÇ be kind friends x 

TLDR: shall I continue seeing this guy I haven‚Äôt seen in over 2 weeks?","I‚Äôm in the minority here but I prefer the wait and observe method. I kept my behavior consistent and waited to see if their behavior aligned with what I was after. Talking everything to death feels like trying to make a square peg fit in a round hole in the beginning stages of getting to know someone. Either you guys gel or you don‚Äôt(which isn‚Äôt a value judgment!).

Make a neutral overture to coordinate plans and see how he responds. If he‚Äôs wishy washy, you have your answer.

I didn‚Äôt have much luck asking for direct clarification. Often people avoid what they perceive as conflict or rejection."

I‚Äôm 37F, we lost our connection after first date, then went back and forth a few times. Four dates total spread apart by months and we recently found each other again. We live in different cities. 

We talked and I expressed that if we are going to try I need better communication. He agreed and has been doing better. Initiating some texts, some convo though slow to respond. Overall better than before. 

The problem is it‚Äôs not enough. The communication is still limited for me and not enough to really start any kind of dating. Our last convo he didn‚Äôt respond to a basic question for 3 days. Was apologetic after, but still I reached out to say are you okay? Replied with an apologetic paragraph and that he misses me and excited to see me soon. 

What could be a good well received way to say it‚Äôs not enough without being overwhelming? He is trying‚Ä¶I see improvement. When we are together we have a good time (no sex or house visits yet). However the time together is so small compared to apart so communication is critical at this stage. 

There is a possibility that we just don‚Äôt have the same idea of communication and dating. I‚Äôm prepared for that but want to say something before completely walking away.

Edit","Let me start with a question for you. Why are you trying so hard? It sounds like you are averaging one date a month, poor communication, he goes days between responses, you've asked for more and it's still not enough and you haven't even explored other areas of compatibility like sexual compatibility. What about this guy is so outstanding that it warrants overlooking all of that?

I can understand putting effort and energy into a relationship. We all should. However, there needs to be a solid foundation that works for you and the energy and effort you apply is to just soften up the rough edges of things, not fundamentally try to change the entire dynamic. So I think on your end you need to ask yourself why you feel this relationship is so worth fighting for.

If you find you have good reasons, and they only need to be good to you, then I think you focus on expressing yourself not by what he is lacking, but by being clear on what you need. You specify your needs and then give him a chance to meet them. If he doesn't, you decide when it's time to move on."

Also, my local library has a lot of things going on too. I haven't had anyone catch my eye there yet, but if I keep going, it'll increase the odds. 

Smaller concert venues are also great for solo dates and meeting people, too. I went to a candlelight concert and a group invited me to dinner afterward.

We're going on a small road trip for a couple of days to celebrate, just as we did to celebrate her birthday in February.

I can say without any reservation that this has been the best year of my life.  I'm just so happy, but in a calm and relaxed way.  I never imagined that I could have found myself with someone so kind, caring, patient, adoring, intelligent, gorgeous, funny -- the whole package with bonus features.  Literally I cannot conceive of a better person for me.  I feel completely understood and like she totally gets me; I also know she feels loved and appreciated by me.  The relationship has been intuitive and easy since day 1, which is unlike any relationship I have ever had in the past.

I struggled in my late 20s and early 30s with mental illness and I think her love and support have truly enabled me to find solid ground and clear sailing.  I definitely did the work too but I have not had any symptoms or episodes since we've been together and I attribute it in large part to her steady affection and understanding.  After a long period in which my health was not the best, now I find myself in the place I've always hoped to be.  I would encourage anyone dealing with similar issues never to give up hope because there's always a beautiful possibility out there.

We're moving in together later this month and I could not be more excited.

Since my last very serious BF, I have been dating for the past 10 years or so. In that time, I've had a couple relationships, the longest of which lasted a year. However, in ten years of dating, maybe \~4 relationships lasting 6-12 months, and many shorter ""situationships"" shall we call them, not one single man has told me he loves me. Not one. Of the two longest and most serious relationships, one ended it after 8 months by saying he just felt like he should be in love with me by then but wasn't. The other told me he was basically gearing himself up to tell me he loved me, but I dumped him for other reasons (very toxic relationship) before he ever did, if he would have at all. 

This past week, a guy I dated  for 4 months who was extremely compatible with me in terms of everything (goals, relationship goals, hobbies, etc), incredible mind blowing physical chemistry and sex, and with which we both had such a easy and comfortable time together, were vulnerable etc with each other, ended things because he said he just didn't feel himself falling for me. I had just started feeling like I was falling for him and had asked him to DTR. Apparently another woman he was seeing also asked him to DTR the same week, and he decided to enter a relationship with her instead (ouch), I assume (but don't know I guess) because he wasn't feeling himself falling for me. Obviously, I am super hurt and the fact he stated he just didn't feel he was falling for me triggered a lot because I feel like no guy does anymore, ever. 

I guess I'm not sure what I'm seeking here, but I feel like I've become unlovable, and I don't understand why. Obviously I've had relationships in the past (like over 10 years ago at this point thought) where I feel in love and it was mutual. But it seems impossible now, and I dread meeting people now that I feel an attraction with because it always ends up the same - we seem to have a great connection but then they just tell me they aren't falling in love regardless, whilst I start falling for them. 

What the hell am I doing wrong? Is this unusual? It makes me feel so horrible that I want to give up dating because I meet great people I click with and want to pursue something with, we seem compatible and having a great time, and yet....it just never goes further because they don't fall for me.  

Help! And yes I have a therapist but she really hasn't been very useful.","You might need people to be exclusive before you move forward with a few things. Maybe not a title, but give one another an honest try without the distractions of others.

- Change ‚ÄúI have eclectic taste in music‚Ä¶‚Äù to ‚ÄúTell me what you‚Äôre listening to ‚Äî I love everything from heavy metal to smooth jazz.‚Äù It makes you sound like you want to connect with her over shared music tastes rather than coming across as a little elitist.

datingoverthirty,13y9yct,1685705069.0,Dates who talk too much about themselves,"I've been on a few dates recently where there other person broke off into extensive monologues about themselves without rest. I would ask a couple of questions to show my interest in their lives while they're talking. Then when they're done, they sit there in an awkward silence without ever reversing the question, and instead speak up again to say more about themselves.

Or if they do ask me a question, they certainly stop talking most of the time (except for the chronic interrupters), but I get the sense they cannot wait for me to shut the hell up so they can start talking again. And at the first chance they get they hijack the conversation, turn it back on themselves, and never go back to what I was talking about. I don't think these are all narcissists or socially awkward people! Frankly I'm just appalled at the lack of self awareness.

How does one develop an emotional connection with another person if you don't quiet down and listen to them or ever ask about their lives? Do you get to know someone deeper over time when you're less chatty? Does the other person just assert themselves more when they want to be heard? I just don't get it.

Does anyone else have this experience? Better yet, is anyone else the person who can't stop talking and share the floor?","An optimistic interpretation would be that the awkward pause is your cue to talk about yourself. Certainly there are people who only want to talk about themselves, but a few others may just expect you to pick up on that cue and want you to share something related."

Honestly, I was not prepared.  I'm 40+ and I've never had a woman approach me in such a manner.  I'm also currently off the apps, which translates to not dating at the moment. She could've just been being friendly, but she wasn't wearing a ring and I'm pretty sure she was interested.  So my question for next time... How do you transition from friendly banter to asking her out? I'm so bad at this!","I love how your post kind of correlates to that of a woman in this sub (I think on the daily thread?!) telling us about how she approached two men in the wild and they both seemed kind of spooked. 

Just wanted to say I‚Äôm happy hearing about more women being more active with making moves out there off the apps :) 

As for your question, I don‚Äôt think I have useful advice, but I‚Äôm sure that because of this experience, should you find yourself in a similar position again, next time you‚Äôll be prepared. And how to move from banter to asking someone out is so dependent on context I think, you gotta try not to be too bamboozled to make the move. And if you can‚Äôt find the right point in the conversation, I think it would be totally fine to say so and say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how to do this more smoothly, so I‚Äôm just going to ask you straight up if you‚Äôd like to go out some time‚Äù.

It was a little stressful beforehand because she had never been, and we planned almost nothing. But it was honestly the most fun I've had with her yet. No service, no distractions. Just the two of us hiking all day, getting stoned as fuck at night and just laughing for hours and hours. It was so so much fun."
datingoverthirty,13xkq8y,1685633746.0,Do you find starting conversations in social settings difficult?,"I went to a university alumni event yesterday, mostly just to get out of the house (pandemic, of course). It was a social event held in a science museum, but everyone seemed to form small groups of friends and stay that way. I hadn't planned to meet anyone I knew from my university days there, since I've lost contact with most of them and the few I do keep in touch with have moved out of town.

Basically, I found it difficult to actually start a conversation with anyone. The only times I did talk to people ended up being just talking to the event staff when I picked up food or was asking for information. Is this typical in anyone's experience at general social events? Did I just have bad luck?

I figured attending this event would give me good practice talking to people.","Alumni events are a little odd because, in my experience, people usually do plan to meet up with a specific crowd there. Re-live the good ole days a bit with the crowd they spent the most time with. The only time I was usually able to meet new people or talk with others at these sorts of things was when a friend had multiple social groups and our groups intermingled for a bit. Mileage may vary - my anecdotes seem to align with yours though.

If you want to get experience talking to people, I think professional networking events might be a better shot. You still might run into some of the same situations, but there are people definitely there for the purpose of making friends + meeting new people + building connections. They can be awkward as hell too but you gotta experience it a little to conquer it."
datingoverthirty,13xfume,1685621261.0,"As someone ultimately seeking a life partner, how can I manage my anxiety about the ""lack of certainty"" during the early stages of dating?","After three very widely spaced out dates with her during the winter, I (36M) started seeing her (36F) much more regularly starting about six weeks ago.

Last week she brought up the question of what each of us is ultimately looking for. and our answers turned out to be the same - that we are ultimately looking for someone for that long-term connection in life. 

While we both didn't mention exclusivity by name, we are headed in that direction. I told her to her that I am interested in exploring this with her to determine the depth of our connection, and to ""see where the chips fall"" between us after some time of getting to know each other. She told me she was grateful for my input, she said she agreed and basically had the same position.

Last weekend we spent a day together doing all sorts of activities. We've already been physical for a little while and the physical chemistry is fantastic. we've also had tons and tons of conversations about all kinds of things.

The problem that is affecting me: while we get along really well and have great physical chemistry, the *uncertainty* as to whether we will be able to form a deeper bond/whether I will be able to develop deeper feelings for her makes me *very* nervous.

This anxiety goes *way* back for me. aside from one or two very serious relationships (one of which was a marriage), I always avoided dating somebody *unless* I had strong feelings early on. (My sense is that this way of going about it has gotten me into trouble)

When I hear about people who date for six months or nine months before they decide to end it, the idea is baffling to me, and it always has been. How does someone get all the way six months etc *before* deciding it's not going to be a long term match? How does that not devastate one of the people involved?

I don't want to stop seeing this woman, I'm curious to see where things go with her. but I'm also terrified that by *not* having strong feelings for her earlier, I might be ""leading her on"", or ""taking advantage of her"", and thinking about that causes me a lot of guilt and makes it harder for me to enjoy the process of getting to know her.

My biggest fear is being in a situation a few months down the road where she is developing feelings for me but I a *not* developing same feelings for her, and being in a position where I must dump her and break her heart. funny enough, if the opposite happens, I feel like I would be much more tolerant of that, because I would have no guilt in that scenario.

But anyway, this ""complex"" of mine is part of the reason why 99% of the time, I rarely go past date number three. This woman I am seeing now is the first time I have ventured into this new territory of ""getting to know someone in dating"" / the uncertainty period.

Luckily I have been able to discuss this very concern with her, and she has a much more relaxed attitude about it. She even made a few lighthearted jokes about how she is still sussing me out as well, which makes me feel much better about this. But I can't help but shake the anxiety, and I don't want it to interfere with the good times I have with her.

is there a better way to think about all of this? I've heard people say ""Take it day by day"", but I also worry that my uncertainty about my long-term prospects with her *not* is not going to change, and I dread finding myself in a position with her one day where I break up with her.

TLDR: i've been dating a woman for six weeks, I look forward to getting to know her more, but that excitement is clouded by anxiety of the possibility of hurting her by eventually breaking things off.","You sound like my ex. Are you my ex? 

Here‚Äôs the deal. If you are always on the lookout for incompatibilities, you‚Äôre going to find one sooner or later. Why? Because nobody is 100% compatible with anyone else. I think it‚Äôs a stretch to even say that 85% compatibility is the most any of us will ever find.  People aren‚Äôt meant to be with a replica because replicas don‚Äôt exist. And they don‚Äôt exist for a good reason! How can we grow together and individually if we are with an exact copy of ourselves?

But if you are dead set on 100% compatibility, you‚Äôre never, ever going to be satisfied. And you‚Äôll be missing out on a lot of people who are right for you while you continue to search for the replica of you. 

As to the 6-9 month breakups. Many (most?) people don‚Äôt even begin to let their guard down and relax until at least six months, at the earliest, which is why those incompatibilities don‚Äôt show up until then. But you‚Äôll never know whether an incompatibility is a dealbreaker if you don‚Äôt give it time. It‚Äôs very fair to say even that there are incompatibilities that won‚Äôt even show up until people move in together. Or get married. 

It‚Äôs not a waste of time to get to know someone with whom it doesn‚Äôt work out. Relationships are trial by error, and we learn about ourselves and what we want (and don‚Äôt want, or thought we didn‚Äôt want but don‚Äôt mind, etc) by giving it a shot. 

Hearts break and hearts heal. They‚Äôre resilient, but only if you trust the process and hope for a good outcome rather than constantly agonize over the what ifs."

I tried to explain to him he has been going away with work a long time so he is experienced in this however I am not so do need reassurance a bit more.

I unfortunately am les endowed then the average male. I am roughly 5 inches and not girthy.  I‚Äôm not a virgin, have been with a few women and I have kids from a previous marriage. But I can‚Äôt get over my self consciousness here. I consider myself a lover and will do whatever to make sure she‚Äôs happy and pleasured but I simply hate the feeling of not having something normal to pull out. 

So what‚Äôs my question, hopefully advice from the ladies but maybe dudes to on this ‚Äúhard‚Äù topic.  Confidence is key, so I know I need to just own it and be confident.  How do I go about not feeling like shit about it. What can I do to be in a good mindset to be happy with it. Primarily beyond worried that she won‚Äôt like it, and I finally found a good one who I have so much in common with and really feel this could go somewhere but what if this makes her just not attracted to me. 

Sorry this post is kind of all over the place but I just hate that I feel like I can‚Äôt be a ‚Äúman‚Äù or be confident about this. Thanks friends.","A personal anecdote that may help, I recently had a thing with a guy who was also pretty small. I am personally dealing with pelvic floor dysfunction with tightness, spasms and painful sex. I wasn‚Äôt sure what I‚Äôd be able to do with my new fling until I saw his size. He was nervous and shy about it similar to you, but I literally thought the good lord sent him to me from the heavens to enjoy sex again. I was talking about it with my girl friend who‚Äôs husband is also somewhat small, and she likes it better that way, too. So you really never know what the girl you‚Äôre with prefers, and bigger isn‚Äôt always better.

Another thing to note is, especially for women 30+, were looking for a real man and all that comes with it. The size of your dick has nothing to do with how much of a man you are. A woman prioritizes so many factors above what you‚Äôre penetrating us with, I promise you.

Editing to add for anyone who doesn‚Äôt know, extensive studies show that STRAIGHT WOMEN have the LEAST fulfilling sex out of every gender & sexual preference combo. Lesbian women have FAR more fulfilling sex on a regular basis. So clearly a dick isn‚Äôt helping anything üòÇ"

I'm super annoyed by this. Your messaging is super weak to begin with, and you send this lame message promising a great phone call to see if we'll vibe. 

Does anybody else get this? Have you ever just pushed through and tried the phone call and it was worth it??",Never experienced this before but the voice chat feature exists specifically so you don‚Äôt have to give your number to strangers.

He was secure in his attachment style (which was incredibly refreshing), the physical chemistry was mind blowing, and we were regularly making plans and talking daily and having meaningful conversations and it felt like a relationship, we were aligned in our relationship wants etc. Asked to DTR the other week because I felt it was going so well and I was falling for him, and he told me that he felt like I was so great, so easy to be with and the time passed so easily together, and the chemistry was incredible, but he just didn't feel like he was falling for me. Talked with him again a week after this rejection conversation, and he's already in a monogamous relationship with someone he was dating while dating me. LOL. I feel like a fucking clown.

It royally sucks to feel like if I'd had that conversation with him earlier it would have turned out differently, and simultaneously royally sucks to feel like the whole thing was way more meaningful to me and he wasn't totally honest with me about what else he had going on, and how quickly he jumped into something else. Ouch. 

Brutal and I hate that now it'll probably be another 6-12 months before I feel ready to date again and maybe meet someone only to have a similar thing play out again as it seems to do every 6-12 months for the past decade.

I \[32F\] have been on a few dates with \[33M\] and he. is. amazing. His job means he takes contracts all over the world which can keep him there for up to a year, and I just happened to match with him on an app on one of his trips back to our hometown.

He is literally EVERYTHING I've been looking for in terms of looks, personality, humour, interests, kindness and chemistry. I feel like I've been forcing it a bit with everyone else I've spoken to in the last year, but he is miles and miles above everyone else. In all honesty, I knew I was being a bit stupid meeting him knowing he will be leaving soon, but I also worried I'd regret it if I didn't meet him.

Anyway, it is what it is - I've been a silly goose and met someone incredible who is leaving the country in the next few weeks. As sad as I am at the prospect of him leaving, in a way I feel like I have nothing to lose.

What would YOU do in my situation? Should I be honest and just tell him how I feel or keep it quiet knowing it most likely won't make a difference?

One way that I feel secure is if my dating partner asks to see me often and regularly. My anxiety peaks when they are not requesting my availability to ask me out of dates. I always enthusiastically reply etc. But I now appreciate this is a very concentric mindset - as they may feel anxious or assume disinterest if they are always the one asking me out.

Time spent together is my love language - I am quite indifferent to frequency of texts or calls in between dates all I care about is spending time together IRL.","One thing I did in a past relationship that felt very secure was create a google doc together of date ideas we wanted to do.

- intuition
- ability to see long term outcomes

They almost never start a convo with me, so I often feel burdened with starting a conversation.

Their pics don't lend themselves to convos, either. Like, how will I start a convo with someone with pics of them at a beach, bar, restaurant, some friends, and eating a sandwich? ""Omg I like beaches too! What's your favorite beach?"" Zzzzzzz.

My assumption is that if their profiles are lazily written (e.g. ""I love cheese""), crappy/clich√© (e.g. ""Lets debate this topic: Is a hot dog a sandwich?""), or a non-response (e.g. "":)""), it's that they're not serious about using the app for whatever reason.

I have a pretty rare condition that's messed up the top of my femur, so even though I'm only 36, I have to have the operation done. It's not like I intend to lie to anyone about it, obviously they'll see the scar, but I have a hard time not viewing this as something that will immediately red flag to everyone as ""old man.""

While I should be back up on my feet unassisted in a pretty quick timeframe, it's going to take about a year to be at 100%, and I don't want to wait that long to start dating. But I am going to have some long term limitations to preserve the implant, like it's recommended I don't run, play football, basketball, tennis, etc. I know some people do this, but considering I don't want to replace this again before retirement age, I'm probably going to take it very conservatively, which means dating someone very active probably isn't a good idea.

Admittedly he was doing something when I asked and looked a little surprised, and his response was ""possibly"" so I handed him a card with my number on it and asked him to maybe text me and let me know.

I am leaning towards taking this as a no from him, which is perfectly fine, and I am not anticipating a text from him. I would like some input on this though. I am admittedly very embarrassed at this moment and wonder if I read his flirtiness wrong.

datingoverthirty,13sixm2,1685121157.0,How can I prevent this issue moving forward?,"BF (35M) and I (31F) of a little over a year broke up on my birthday last weekend due to communication issues and lifestyle differences. At the end of the day, I couldn‚Äôt handle that he needed to be on a substance at all times (either his Adderall which is prescribed, but took way more than the recommended dose and would purchase it from random people from the bar, his habit of drinking a lot more than I felt was needed (he would go through a 6-12 pack in one evening), and his excessive use of weed (which I usually don‚Äôt have a problem with, but combined with the other things it was just too much)) and the lack of insight of his day to day life. 

Moving forward, what can I do moving forward to prevent these issues in my next relationships? I don‚Äôt mind my partner having a drink or smoking socially, but I don‚Äôt want to date/ marry heavy users. When it comes to communication, I just want to be kept in the loop and not be an afterthought which I felt like I was a majority of the time in the last 6 months.","to me it seems like the obvious answer is not to move forward with people who dot hat, so I'm wondering why it doesn't *feel* obvious to you as the solution? Do you worry that they'll conceal their usage from you so that you can't make that decision? I get being able to hide adderall, but you'd probably notice within the first few weeks of dating someone if they're constantly using weed or having 6+ beers in one evening. 

Looking for lifestyle cues can also help weed people out.  I feel like a good number of substance users have a lifestyle that tends to enable or require the substances (though not always). If someone is partying until 2am in their 30s, excessive cocaine/drinking/something is usually behind it.

Communication might be a less obvious thing since they're not ingesting it, but also something you can opt in or out of if they don't meet your standard."

datingoverthirty,13rx1zr,1685057832.0,How are people so optimistic about relationships?,"It happened, everyone. I (33F) met an amazing person (36M). He's smart, kind, gorgeous, hardworking, consistent AND we had the exclusivity talk last night after 3 weeks dating.  He asks questions to understand what I want out of a relationship and he does not seem to be love bombing me. It's everything I wanted after about 4 years mostly single.  


I am so scared now. I thought I was not afraid of commitment. Yet, here I am. There are probably a few things into play here, such as me not being as attracted to someone who is emotionally available, or the fact that I absolutely love my single life. But now I am also questioning if this guy has a realistic view of relationships. I realized that I've become cynical when I see someone feeling optimistic and excited about a long-term relationship and get excited about it. Do they understand how much work and trouble goes into having a lifetime partnership? How hard it is to raise kids? How can he be looking so excited about a relationship already?

What's wrong with me?! I am afraid I will jump out of this situationship before it can become something serious just because I'm scared. And it's probably a bit too early to talk about that with him.   


Has anyone been in a situation like this before? Do I just keep going? How do I keep myself interested besides my (perhaps unfounded) fears?","Slow down a little there.  Agreeing to be in an exclusive relationship after 3 weeks of dating doesn‚Äôt just jump to being married with kids.  It sounds like there are some commitment fears but that‚Äôs normal.  What‚Äôs not normal is letting those fears spiral out of control to where you start making up excuses in your head for why a relationship will fail.  If the relationship is working, going exclusive is a logical next step- see how it goes and don‚Äôt be afraid to communicate your concerns to your partner.  Enjoy each others company and have fun together.  Then down the road you both can decide where to go next."
datingoverthirty,13s7vim,1685091795.0,Guy I've been dating for 3 months isn't sure about the future. What should I do?,"So the guy (M35) I'm dating and I (31F) started off as casual but both developed feelings and an emotional connection after a couple of weeks, so we decided that we were going to explore that with the potential to become more serious. We became exclusive so as to focus on each other, but not official (bf/gf).

We get along amazingly, we share similar interests, humour and life goals, we've had many great times together (including meeting each others friends) and sexually we've both said it's the best connection we've ever had. We communicate daily and it's consistent, open and honest. We see each other 2/3 times a week around our busy lives. From the beginning he made it clear that my feelings were really important to him and I could talk to him about anything, so he's always felt very safe.

Given how close we are and how great it's gone so far, there's no doubt in my mind I see a future with him (obviously no one knows for sure how that future will work out, I just know I want to try). The problem is, despite treating me so well, telling me this is the healthiest 'relationship' he's ever had and telling me how amazing I am, he doesn't feel as strongly as I do yet (I recently told him I loved him). He says his feelings have grown over time but he's concerned that they haven't grown as much as he feels like they should, given all the time we've spent together and how great it's been. And essentially he can't say for sure if he's ever going to get there. He can't explain what the reason for that is because he says he doesn't understand why himself, so it's all very confusing for both of us.

He says he doesn't want to lose me and he really wants more time to let his feelings naturally progress, but he understands if him not being sure and not being able commit to me yet means I have to walk away for my own mental well-being (it's obviously causing anxiety being in this limbo stage).

Do I take a risk and continue on with this in the hopes his feelings will continue to progress and he'll make his mind up that he wants to be with me long term? Or do I cut ties now? Either way it's going to break my heart whenever or however it ends, if it does. üòî


EDIT: Lots of people telling me he's just keeping me around until he finds better/to pass the time/for sex etc which I expected but I think I left an important detail out: he really wants kids and I want more too (I have 2). He's not getting any younger and he himself has said he feels the clock ticking. Why would he waste precious time on me if his intentions aren't good? I also know he's not on apps or talking to any women, so I don't know when or how he'd find a better option.

Also, he was cheated on for most of his only real relationship (8 years). Not sure if that's also something to consider.","Sometimes healthy relationships where people feel safe, comforted, supported, with healthy sexual openness and exploration, where there‚Äôs no drama, constant questioning, or chasing - feel ‚Äòboring‚Äô to people who are not used to them. It feels like something is missing, like the toxic highs were an indication of some magical passion that other people don‚Äôt get experience, like that‚Äôs the sign of ‚Äòtrue love‚Äô. 

Another possibility can be that this is someone who isn‚Äôt fully there emotionally. He can want to feel things for you, but can also hold himself from actually going there. People who don‚Äôt have a rich emotional life, or emotional exploration, find it hard to actually feel their feelings fully. If all you talk about is feeling ‚Äògood or bad‚Äô and don‚Äôt explore the complexity and nuance of deeper feelings, how can you tell the different between lust, desire, infatuation, love, appreciation, safety, and so on. Ask him if he feels loved? If he felt in love in the past. Sometimes people are also stuck on how things were in the past, not realising that as they change, their feelings will change too and develop differently. 

Good luck either way."

datingoverthirty,13rh45k,1685019491.0,How do I deal with the ‚Äòsee where it goes‚Äô,"I had a date yesterday and I asked him what he was looking for. He said ‚Äòjust see where it goes, you can only take it one date at a time. If you have a relationship that you enjoy that lasts 6 months and another which lasts 2 years it doesn‚Äôt matter because you enjoyed yourself. There is no rush to get married and have kids‚Äô etc.

However I want a life partner and I want the full marriage and I want children. I know that I really want children (I‚Äôm not too bothered about actually getting married but I want that life partner setup). I don‚Äôt know how so many people say ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt know yet‚Äô or ‚Äòsee how it goes‚Äô when they are in their mid thirties. Are they literally going out for a date and have no idea what they want the outcome of that to be? 

My issue is, so I continue with these wishy washy guys or date people who know that they are looking for a long term partner and they know they want children? Loads say ‚ÄòI‚Äôm not sure yet, but I might if I find the right person‚Äô. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs a female thing, but I find that I want children regardless of whether I find the right person or not (whether I do it is a different matter but I *want* them). 

The guy yesterday said the same and about not rushing and that his parents had him in their fourties. I don‚Äôt know if he is naive or optimistic but fertility does decline and to have multiple children is risky to have this blas√© attitude when I am already 34. Because he had not had a serious relationship for a while and doesn‚Äôt have the need that I have he is too happy for the ‚Äòsee where it goes approach‚Äô but I think that is risky.

He just sits there on my social media and I hate that he has access to what's happening in my life.

datingoverthirty,13qgd9p,1684919509.0,Breadcrumbing: Do you confront or leave while you still have a shred of dignity left?,"I (34F) dated this guy (35M) for 2.5 months. Great connection, great conversations, similar interests, great effort, kindness, respect, something promising, both wanting relationship, etc. He called it off because of long distance (different cities, 4hr train, expensive as hell). I agree, it's valid. It stings, but I move on and start dating again.

What follows is a series of 14-month-long breadcrumbing situation, where he would initiate messages that include things like: I miss spending time with you, I'm thinking of you just wanted to say Merry Christmas, hope you're doing well, you're one of the few people I've had the most pleasant time with, you're a reminder of the type of people I want to be around, thank you for sharing the warmth of your heart with me, time with you always felt right, how beautiful you are (seeing a picture on IG). 

You get the gist. Popping up with these short infrequent messages that go nowhere of substance, and then disappearing for months. And so my heart flutters (quietly), and so on. Throw in some lingering feelings from my side, and a great deal of empathy, and you get this.

 Last time I tried to pin it down. I suggested a phone call to say hi and catch up. He said, sure, next week it is. But yup, that's right, he disappeared for 10 days and came back saying he's so sorry (with no excuse) that he'd actually rather meet in person whenever he's in my city (heaven knows when). I didn't reply and not planning on it. 

Thinking, if he's been THAT interested surely he wouldn't miss the opportunity to speak with me, no? Not to mention risk losing me in the first place. 

I've finally admitted the truth to myself. I've been breadcrumbed. 

Surely he'll come back, as he always does. Not sure if I confront him? ask him what he wants? or leave his messages on read, or change my tone, to where it's short replies ""thanks"", ""you too"", ""I'm busy, I can't meet, have fun!""

What would you do?","If you are seriously seeking a relationship with someone, you have cut off the tie you share with this guy. He‚Äôs keeping you in his back pocket for a rainy day when he‚Äôs in your city. You want someone‚Äôs full attention:  pursue that wholeheartedly without distractions. If you don‚Äôt want to block him, mute his messages. You‚Äôve acknowledged that he‚Äôs giving you breadcrumbs, now the power is yours to stop feeding into this little machination.

datingoverthirty,13qfmjx,1684916896.0,I'm not sure how to handle (lack of) exclusivity,"There's this guy I met on a dating app mid-April. We have been on 8 dates so far (about one or two dates per week). He seems pretty awesome - makes time for me, plans dates, pays for most things, cooks dinner for me, we have similar active lifestyle, family values etc. We are moving quite slow physically - we didn't kiss until the 5th or 6th date, and we haven't had sex yet. We have cuddled, and I slept over one time. He always tries to make our dates as long as possible.

I'm ready to date only him now, as I don't have time nor interest to see new people right now. However, he still has two dating apps installed and he's still receiving messages there, as I see notifications on his phone. I don't know how active he is in dating others, given his availability to me (we either see each other or talk most days) I don't think he has actually been on a date with someone else for the past two weeks. However, if he is still swiping and chatting I take it he isn't fully interested in me? This is starting to bother/hurt me and I'm not sure I can or should allow things to move further while I don't know we are committed to seeing each other only.

How can I bring this up? Should I? And if we aren't on the same page, should I stop seeing him?

Full disclosure, pretty much all of my past relationships were casual / with unavailable men, and I'm anxiously attached in romantic relationships (FA most likely), so I'm afraid to self-sabotage a potentially good thing. On the other hand, I _am_ dating with intention for a committed, serious relationship and don't want to be led on or disappointed.

*TLDR: Been seeing someone for 6 weeks - regular dates, some intimacy (no sex). I'm now seeing only him and I'm bothered by him still being on dating apps. Should I bring this up? If so, how? And should I walk away if we aren't on the same page yet?*

ETA: I didn't originally mention this in my post, but last week I told him that I had deleted the app on my phone, although I still have my profile there (and I have a hobby where I meet many men). Yesterday when he showed some insecurities about me going out and possibly hooking up with others, I told him his issue with it doesn't make sense if we are still seeing other people. I told him this would be different if we decided to date only each other, and that I'm waiting for his prompt for that. He seemed a bit uncomfortable with the conversation and said something like ""IDK"". So while I didn't make my stance clear, I gave him an in and he didn't take it.","How to handle lack of exclusivity: you don‚Äôt.

We‚Äôve always had great vibes and chemistry. 5 months ago I noticed things shift between us with neither acting. 

His mom died suddenly a month ago. For the month prior I was by his side daily while he dealt with hospitals and decisions. Things got even more intense between us.

(For context, I haven't had a date or real conversation with anyone since February, and maybe only 10 or so matches in the intervening three months; that said, I do live in a pretty rural area.) 

I try to remind myself that people have chosen to like my profile in the past for *some* reason, and that means they probably will again in the future, but somehow it's still hard to shake the idea that there might be something wrong/unappealing about me during these OLD doldrums. I am sure there's lots for me to work on in the meanwhile in terms of trying to build up my confidence apart from dating, but any tips you have would be quite welcome :)","The more I think about it, the more I feel we simply were not designed to date. For millenia, people married without courtship. They married for survival, political reasons, convenience, and economics. Marrying for love was rare, and being in love was actually viewed as a mental illness/disease because of the effects it had on people. Dating as we know it is pretty new, and it is not easy. And requirements have shifted. Instead of survival, people are seeking companionship and lasting romance, which has radically individualized and complicated the requirements for finding a mate. Not 100 percent what I want? Next!

I honestly don't think we were designed to get emotionally involved with dozens of people throughout our lifetimes. Most people want to find rich, lasting companionship with one person. And while I don't think the alternative (arranged marriage) is a lot better, I don't believe we've found much success at choosing our own mates."

Any tips for a us guys out there that want to take that step but always fall short? Thanks.",The best thing you can do is just start talking to strangers in general and just make that something you do on a day to day basis. Some of these strangers will be attractive women. Once you've had a little bit of small talk then you could ask for a date or their number.
datingoverthirty,13q0xxw,1684876304.0,Would you include these things in your profile?,"Someone I recently dated for a bit mentioned that I have lots of ""pleasant surprises"" that don't come across on my OLD profile. I don't mention some of these things directly because it would feel a little cringey and TBH it feels like every profile says something along these lines if it can, which makes it just sound samey.  


* Level of physical fitness. I work out nearly every day and it shows - running, powerlifting, yoga, hiking. It definitely doesn't come across in my photos, though. I do mention fitness in my list of ""geek outs"".
* Career success. I have a really well paying career that I enjoy, but the job title is a little obscure to anyone outside my industry and people don't usually know how good it is. I try to not even bring it  up or hint at my financial success on first dates.
* I'm pretty well traveled & cultured. Another date said that I say a lot of ""surprising things"" given my upbringing, and I've gotten comments similar to that from pretty much all of my LTRs. Listing # of countries visited etc always seems not self aware though because there's definitely someone out there with a higher number and it really just shows you have money.  


My profile must not be complete trash since I can still get dates. Sometimes even with people I find attractive! But... still single ... so what are your thoughts? How would you feel about those things being included on a guy's profile?","None of those need to be expressly written into a profile.  Career and financial success can come across as bragging and frankly attract the wrong kind of matches.  For fitness and travel,you can add prompts to talk about travel stories and the kinds of activities you enjoy.  Your profile shouldn‚Äôt be your life story, it‚Äôs an introduction."
datingoverthirty,13q0x6t,1684876261.0,How to take a dating break in practical terms?,"Like many people on this sub, I‚Äôm burnt out on dating and need a break. I‚Äôve been single since 2017 and have been on the apps since then and I can‚Äôt take it anymore!

I‚Äôve done many a ‚Äòdating break‚Äô in that time where I‚Äôll delete the apps from my phone and focus on other things but after a while find myself feeling guilty and re-downloading or accessing my accounts some other way. My dating breaks always end up being just slowed down dating in practice. 

I feel like I do all that focussing on my self stuff anyway (regular exercise, spending time with friends, self care, therapy etc) so I know how to fill the time. What I can‚Äôt seem to figure out is how to shake the guilt that I SHOULD be putting myself out there? And resist the siren call of the apps? I tell myself it‚Äôs for my own good as they‚Äôre not making me feel good anymore but it never seems to stick. 

Also‚Ä¶.what the hell do you do about sex?? I want a six month dating break but I DO NOT want a six month sex break. Another spanner in the works is I‚Äôll often tell myself I‚Äôll just use them for something more casual but then get sucked back in. Unfortunately I have nobody on the roster I can call on currently (or at least definitely nobody I SHOULD call on) so how else do you address that in your dating breaks?","I meaaaannnn‚Ä¶ maybe a sex break could teach you things about yourself.

Even if the ultimate lesson you learn is that you need sex in your life more often than once every 6 months haha"
datingoverthirty,13puqdt,1684862341.0,When do you tell your parents or introduce them to a partner,"This isn't really an i√üue anymore because we've talked it through but it has got me ruminating about what is normal. Last night my (34f) boyfriend (31m) seemingly out of the blue asked me if my parents knew about him. They don't. He told his parents and siblings about me before we were even officially together and I have met one of his siblings. Neither of us lives near our families so it's not like we would be going to dinner with them regularly or anything. I'm divorced and my parents being super conservative still consider my ex my husband (no kids). They also think really poorly of me for getting divorced and are likely to view anyone I'm dating as basically a mistress (Mister Ess?). They think I'm a whore for having slept with more than one person and I am not especially anxious to give them one more reason to think less of me. His family is way more chill and their relationship is less formal. At this age I would think most of us have had some failed relationships and family members who have provided their unwanted input enough that we want to be careful about who we bring around. When I was younger I would bring them around shortly after becoming official and my parents wouldn't acknowledge the romantic aspect of the relationship and adamantly refer to them as a friend (but still insist I be chaperoned when spending time with them). They expected this even when I was moved out into my 20s until I got engaged at which point they accepted my ex husband. They're already disappointed in me that I brought my ex into their lives and then left that relationship, they don't care why. They continue a relationship with him and view him as a son. I see my parents probably 2-4 times a year so it's not like they're an every day part of my life, it just doesn't seem as important to introduce them to people I date. How have your families felt about your exes and when do you think is normal to introduce a new partner? Do you have similar judgement and parental induced guilt over failed relationships? Am I being crappy to my boyfriend by not introducing them? He thinks they would like him because all his ex's parents liked him but I know my parents and they wouldn't.","Your parents sound dreadful. Trust me, I know all about parents not being normal and accepting of a spouse or relationship. Make it abundantly clear to him that your parents have an absolutely toxic side to them and that they are deeply hateful in ways he will likely never be able to overcome (religion and narcissism and conservative values are essentially impossible to overcome in general).

He needs to understand that having acceptance from your parents may never happen, that people in their shoes routinely plot and scheme to break up relationships they don't approve of, and that you being there for each other needs to be 'enough', much as he might like more. It ain't gonna happen and it can cause much stress and heartbreak for everyone involved."
datingoverthirty,13pv55o,1684863283.0,Update - meeting single parents in the wild,"Five months ago, I posted here looking for advice on dating as it looked like I was about to become a full time single parent.

Well‚Ä¶it happened. I‚Äôm a full time single parent -  kid is with me 98% of the time and will have supervised visits. This is the absolute best case scenario safety wise coming out of the nightmare we just walked through. 

And guess what‚Ä¶I met someone. 

2 months ago, playing at the park with my kid and he was there with his kids. We were checking each other out from across the playground üòÜand I got brave and said Hi. Turns out our kids were playing together. 

This has flipped everything I have ever thought about dating on its head. Kids have been involved since Day 1 because they were there on day one. 

We are finding ways to enjoy time together just us which is rare, but most of the time when we hang, it‚Äôs us and my kid or us and all the kids. 

He‚Äôs wonderful. He has a teen full time (Mom lives out of the country and is not involved other than phone calls since the the last few years) and a young elementary age kid (same age as mine) who lives mostly with her Mom (due to his work schedule and it‚Äôs an informal arrangement he can‚Äôt really fight) but he‚Äôs very close to her and gets her as much as he can. His ex also has a tween he helped raise since she was a toddler and he gets her sometimes too. 

The kids get along beautifully. I think his kids are awesome. He treats my kid with so much love and kindness. 

I could go on and on about him and maybe I will later, but for now‚Ä¶ has anyone else had this happen? 

Would love to hear your stories!

Well we broke up üôà.

datingoverthirty,13pthjx,1684859531.0,Comparing our relationship to his ex wife,"Hey folks, 

So, I've been seeing this lovely man since April. There have been lots of green flags - our communication is very clear and open, we definitely have a wonderful emotional and physical connection, and our effort is equally matched which is wonderful. He has been very open about his divorce and co-parenting situation, which is great. I am happy to give him space to vent about co-parenting frustrations, and I want to foster a safe, open environment where we both can be open and vent when needed.

The issue I am struggling with is frequent comparison of his relationship with his ex wife, to our new relationship. He was married for ~2 decades, so I get that she will be a figure in the majority of his stories and experiences, it's just exhausting always listening to stories that have 'we' - referring to his ex wife. The problem I am having is that during his co-parenting vents, as he is wrapping up, he always takes time to state 'and this was a toxic component to that relationship - I'm glad we're doing things differently' or 'and this is why I'm so excited about our relationship'. I appreciate that he's excited about us, however, I feel uncomfortable when he pairs this excitement with the drudgery of his previous relationship.

I plan to talk to him about this soon, I'm just curious if this is normal/typical behavior of someone who is completely over the pain of a failed relationship.


Edit: Thanks all for the advice and input! I had a conversation about this with him yesterday. He apologized for vocalizing the comparison, and seems to understand why it was so uncomfortable for me.","Similar story here. When I started dating my current guy 3 years ago he was fresh out of a nasty divorce and would frequently disparage his ex and then immediately praise me, saying ""you're so different from her,"" ""I like that you're like (blank), my ex was not (blank),"" and so on. As you said, I know he meant it as compliments but it made me feel uncomfortable and gross. Eventually I snapped at one of these statements and said ""you know, I would appreciate if you could compliment me without directly comparing me to your ex wife. I do not want to be held up because she is being put down. I am awesome because I am awesome, not because I'm not like her."" He apologized and we discussed it calmly later and it has never happened again. Like your post says, we both allow each other the space and safety of discussing past traumas and relationships. But a compliment via comparison to an ex is not a compliment in my eyes. Talk to your guy about how this makes you feel, he may not even realize he is doing this. Intentions do not mitigate impact. Good luck!"

Of course, I‚Äôm going to be myself, but I also know that a lot of times, many people (including myself) don‚Äôt know how to present ourselves effectively even with our great qualities; that‚Äôs the point of this post.

If you focus on photos, what type of photos do you find most attractive/would swipe right on? Same thing with prompts, personal description, and any other info.

Are they pushing a certain narrative about themselves (world traveler, extreme sports fanatic, sex god, rich and fancy, hard and cold, etc.)?

datingoverthirty,13pbxjt,1684810551.0,I was just dropped huge information by my boyfriend,"I (33F) have been dating almost (29M) for almost 8 months. On date two I grilled him about his educational background and career. He told me where he graduated from and that he also graduated law school and works with his law degree part time. He said he took a gap year after college then went to law school. I have my MA and I am in my first year of my PhD program. He also said he works with his family business. I said okay and we started dating. One of my dealbreakers was educational background (having post grad).

We had some bumps in the beginning of the road but nothing for 6 months. We get along so well it‚Äôs almost scary. We have fun and we can be silly and goofy with one another. We have the same values, shared hobbies, and are both family oriented. The age gap makes no difference to us. We just click. Intimacy is the best I‚Äôve ever had. We said ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù by month 5. We have built a strong emotional connection. Things seemed to be too good to be true. 

Tonight I drove over because I forgot my charger (he lives at home but his parents are on vacation) and to spend a few hours with him after work today. Before I was going to head out I talked about our timeline. Like what would get us to move forward in the relationship after a year (like moving in together). I also joked about how long it would take for us to get married. He closed his eyes and looked distraught. I asked him what was wrong. He said he wasn‚Äôt honest with me about one thing. I trust him so I know it wasn‚Äôt about him being unfaithful. I asked him what it is. He became silent for 5 minutes then said he never went to law school and doesn‚Äôt have a law degree but he did graduate college. He said he‚Äôs been procrastinating going back to school and he wanted to come clean so many times but he felt I would break up with him because it was a dealbreaker of mine and my parents are very educated (both are physicians).

At first I didn‚Äôt know what to say but I suspected it sometimes but now I have confirmation. I‚Äôm not upset at the information just that he didn‚Äôt tell me until now. He said he‚Äôs going to apply to law schools this year in our state. I told him I‚Äôll support him if this is what he wants to do.

I still love and care about him but I‚Äôm just sad he just now tells me and wasn‚Äôt honest from the get go. He‚Äôs a kind and loving person and he treats me amazingly. But this makes our timeline more difficult. Marriage seems 5 years away now. He is so dedicated to his family‚Äôs business I don‚Äôt know if he‚Äôll continue to procrastinate law school or not.

I‚Äôm somewhat shocked at this new information but before I kissed him goodbye I said it doesn‚Äôt change how I feel about him and I‚Äôll support him in his educational journey. Just unsure about how the future will look. I‚Äôm ready to settle down in 2 and a half years when I graduate, he definitely won‚Äôt be ready. He feels I deserve better than him and he fears he‚Äôs wasting my time. I reassured him he‚Äôs not and what I have with him I won‚Äôt have with any other guy on this planet.

I know we‚Äôll continue to talk about this together. His family‚Äôs business won‚Äôt be around forever so he said he knows he needs a plan. I just don‚Äôt know how much I trust him to get the ball rolling.

This was a big lie imo and though I‚Äôm not mad it puts things into question. I don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶ should I be upset more? How do I support him? Am I okay with all of this because it directly impacts our future. He said he had no idea he‚Äôd find someone like me and things would go so well and he feels bad he lied to me. Everything was literally perfect before this. My family also believes he‚Äôs a lawyer so that complicates things further.

If your partner held back info for this long, what did you do?

Edit 2 (posted in comments but suggested to be here as well):

‚Ä¶ as I‚Äôve said before, I don‚Äôt care about that anymore and haven‚Äôt for six months. That was a while ago. What I care about is the relationship and how I‚Äôm being treated. Did he lie? Yeah, because I intimidated him. Could he have come clean sooner? Absolutely. But that‚Äôs okay. What I see is a good guy who made a mistake, wants to start making a life for himself because he wants to, is a hard worker, is family oriented, and before all this has treated me respectfully and lovingly. That‚Äôs what matters. If people are still going to comment about educational backgrounds it‚Äôs likely because they don‚Äôt have higher education themselves and think they‚Äôre date-able and great and how dare anyone exclude people with only a high school diploma or college? You know, it‚Äôs been studied the more two people have in common the better the odds are the relationship will last long term. So a person with higher education dating someone with the same background can connect on that and their experiences getting to where they are now. Nothing wrong with that.

FYI: I‚Äôve dated several men who only had a BA. I didn‚Äôt care about that then. Some were nice, others just not a good fit. I had my educational requirement because I thought it would help me find someone like-minded. That‚Äôs basically it. Not for any other reason, not because it means they are ‚Äúmore intelligent‚Äù, more successful, rich, etc.

People really need to ask why they are so triggered by something I wanted long ago and for the right reasons. Also if I was a snob and some elitist wouldn‚Äôt I have dumped my boyfriend the minute he told me the truth? Lol. I did the opposite. I told him I don‚Äôt think any less of him and it‚Äôs okay but that honesty is important to me from here on out. You all paint me as an unreasonable b*tch yet all you know is my gender, my age, and that I‚Äôm in a relationship. You all know literally nothing else and continue dogpiling on me and judging me for something I have stated one million times no longer matters to me.",The fact that his lack of graduate degree made no difference in your relationship or how he treated you should be a sign that you need to re-think what you prioritize in a partner.

datingoverthirty,13opdgl,1684758110.0,Am I overreacting?,"Hi all

Back to online dating (unfortunately) after a long time and finding it just as exhausting as I remember it was. 

I found myself in the same situation a couple of times and I was wondering if I might be overreacting?

The situation is: chatting for several days (2-3 weeks) regularly on either the app or instagram, convos go well, there are compliments flying around which I assume means they do find me physically attractive. Then while talking they mention they are going on dates, all the while not making any attempts at arranging anything with me even after I dropped some hints. At that point I turn off completely as I feel like they are not interested enough to want to meet up and therefore they might just keep me around as a plan b/c/d. Do you think that‚Äôs a correct interpretation of what‚Äôs going on?

I just had a similar case this morning and l was so turned off that I politely ended our chat and just don‚Äôt feel like meeting up at all. The issue isn‚Äôt that they are going on other dates (which I am doing too and it‚Äôs totally fine at such an early stage) but the fact that I seem to be kept in this weird ‚Äútalking stage‚Äù while they don‚Äôt want to make plans to meet up, which they are clearly making with others?",">The situation is: chatting for several days (2-3 weeks)

several days and 2-3 weeks are very different IMO. I think once chatting gets to 3-4 days, you start to reply less and less. People either take the hint and ask you out, or you realize they're simply a chatter at that point.

At some point you have to preserve your focus for people who are at least going to commit to meeting up - don't expect the other person to cut themselves off. You have to do it for yourself.

>while they don‚Äôt want to make plans to meet up, which they are clearly making with others?

editing this post because my brain skipped over this key line:

>Then while talking they mention they are going on dates, all the while not making any attempts at arranging anything

what??? don't go on dates with people who talk about going on other dates. That's just... no. They're trying to make you feel a certain way, and that way isn't comfortable. Just because you're going on dates, doesn't mean you need to advertise it to others who you're dating."

But now that I'm 30 with a string of partners I was very physically attracted to, but otherwise incompatible with, I'm trying to broaden my understanding of attraction.

In my experience attraction can grow over time.. but usually when there‚Äôs no pressure for it to grow. For example, when you have a platonic friend who over time becomes more physically attractive as you get to know them. 

When you are already involved or wanting so much to be physically attracted to someone who otherwise ticks all your boxes, it doesn‚Äôt always happen because of the pressure we put on it. Although, I find if ever you part ways and see that person happy with someone else, you‚Äôd be surprised how you suddenly find that person attractive."
datingoverthirty,13olqpy,1684747186.0,Feedback on What I Could Be Doing Wrong,"**UPDATE:**  
Dude got back to me and siad he wasn't feeling it physically. I think this might be most situations where people don't want to admit it. Either way, we ended on good terms and he was relieved I wasn't hurt by it! It still sucks, but at least my character is in high compliment. Just wish I could find someone who thought both were attractive lol.   


\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  


( This might be a bit long but I figure more information will help you guys give me feedback. )

Got back from a date with someone who was good on paper and had fun. We both found out we had a lot in common across lifestyle, life goals, dealbreakers, etc. He wanted to plan something and asked for my availability. When I reaffirmed how much fun I had, he rejected me in text.

I'm a weirdo and like constructive feedback if I did something that was offputting so I can be better for the next person. Understandably, I rarely get feedback. In this case, I didn't.

When I do get feedback, it's almost always something they admit is minuscule. ""You're almost perfect. But this one thing you fulfill most of the way isn't all of the way and that won't work."" ( I've been told this three times. ) Barely meeting a requirement and being denied is understandable. But - mostly being there and still being denied? Seems odd and they seem upset about their decision or outright were. When I don't vibe with someone, it's something I can pinpoint and I often inform the man as a form of closure. Anyone else experiences this?

I'm not picky beyond dealbreakers. There's no such thing as a ""perfect person"" so I try and be flexible where possible. Example: I want an active partner but they prefer to do indoor gym stuff? Cool. I'll portion some of my exercise time to be indoors with them too.

In the last four months, I've updated my wardrobe based on feedback from male peers. I've also improved my communication skills by asking more about them and engaging in their topics of choice. A sincere gesture on my part that was lacking either due to nerves or ADHD.

My matches have improved drastically. But since my breakup in February with my last partner ( Mr.B ), I've been on dates with seven men. Two lasted two dates and five lasted one. This was 28% due to my lack of interest and 72% due to them. Between Mr.A and Mr.B I had been on dates with three different men. One lasted 4 dates ( we mutually ended it ), one lasted two dates, and the other lasted one date.

Is it bad to have those five recent ones flake after the first date and is it a reflection on me? Or is this simply a numbers game? Is it possible there's nothing wrong with me and it's just personality / energy incompatibility for both of us? If it's any of these scenarios, how do I fix it?

Would legit love advice from those who've experienced the ""good/great but not perfect"" scenario more often than not!","Three things for me:

1. People look for instant gratification and very rarely have the patience and intention of giving someone a chance if they don‚Äôt have 100% of desired attributes. This is how modern dating works in western culture and it is absolutely rubbish, also fostering a mentality of ‚Äúthere‚Äôs always something better out there‚Äù.

2. Lack of physical attraction. This is underrated in the sense that people will never be truthful about not considering you hot enough or just thinking they can score someone with better physical attributes. I find this is a lot more common than people like to admit. You can be hot enough to fuck for a few times but they‚Äôll still keep a wandering eye.

3. Someone else came along who they find hotter or just want to temporarily focus on. Linked to point 1. When there isn‚Äôt a very reasonable excuse for severing a connection - it‚Äôs just most likely there is someone else in the picture."
datingoverthirty,13oc7em,1684718058.0,I met a woman on Hinge ticking almost all the boxes but I don't feel anything or enjoy intimacy even during the initial phase.,"I (M38) met someone (W36) a few weeks ago. The fourth date was dinner at her place and we had sex. I disclosed my inexperience (doing it nearly after 15 years), which she had already realized. She supported and guided me the whole time and we both enjoyed our time. We have met a few times and had sex. I am still learning lots of things and am nowhere near a perfect/fully experienced partner. Both of us, especially her, are open to trying new things and supporting each other.  
While I had been craving to have these moments for years, now that I have them I don't really feel or enjoy anything. Despite lots of kissing/foreplay, laughter, communication, dirty talks, the sex to me feels like a chore (or somewhat boring) even though it has been only 3-4 times since we met. I suspect her big body size might be making me less attracted to her. I weigh around 150 lb and I guess she does 220 lb, so there is a some difference in body size that might be dampening my arousal.

Or it could be because I am so used to self-pleasuring that I cannot enjoy real pleasure. There is no known stress or anxiety as such and no known health issues. I eat healthy food and consider myself fit. I used to watch porn for 5-10 min once in two weeks before I met her. Otherwise, I always used my imagination for self-pleasure.  

She seems a wonderful person and I don't have any issues with her beyond this. She ticks all boxes otherwise. She supports me a lot during intimacy. So, it is totally MY problem and I have to fix it. Any advice would be highly appreciated.  


TLDR: I (M38) met someone (W36) on Hinge and got intimate in a long time. Struggling to feel and enjoy anything. Sex feels like a chore even though it has been 3-4 times only since we met. I think it is her big body size that might be making me less attracted to her. Everything else is perfect about her. A bit confused about what to do.

Edit: I changed some details about cuddling and body size differences as I couldn't fully describe why it bothered me.

Update 1: many have pointed out that I am not attracted to her and I should stop wasting her time. Here, on dating subreddits, we often complain about modern dating making people look for instant gratification and spark and they miss out slow burn or other types of romance that might take some time to develop.

I am looking for something long-term and don't want to waste neither my nor their time. But I also dont wanna lose a good long-term connection over something that could be temporary. That is what I am trying to figure out whether it is truely because of a lack of attraction fromy side or something that could be fixed.","It might have nothing to do with sexual attraction. As they used to say, the largest sex organ is the brain. You are newly intimate with another human for the first time in 15 years! That is huge. You might be having all kinds of reactions that you aren‚Äôt even consciously aware of - fear of losing autonomy, anxiety about losing this new connection, regret over past connections that you had let go but are now reminded of‚Ä¶ my guess is that the suddenly low libido is an emotional reaction to something. Talking to a therapist, journaling, or meditating could be ways to tap into whatever is going on subconsciously. Congratulations on doing something brave and exploring this connection. It feels like you are appreciative that this woman is being gentle and kind with you and I assume you are being gentle and kind to her. Just keep doing that and being gentle with yourself too!"
datingoverthirty,13o6cuq,1684703209.0,How do you close a date?,"Edit; Thank you all for your responses both helpful and hilarious. 
Overall we are mostly awkward and it seems like the best approach is to learn how to sit with this awkwardness as well as honesty. Ideally, there is some physical touch throughout the date, so things are clearer and awkwardness can be somehow avoided. If not, try to be vulnerable - mention that you feel awkward in the end of the dates or say something among the lines ‚ÄúCan I have a hug‚Äù etc. A text ‚ÄúI had a nice time and I would love a second date‚Äù can keep things moving when both wish!
(Glad I‚Äôve learned the difference between the side hug and hug) (I am a Female - enjoyed that most assumed I am a male )

The End - The part of date that I fear the most. No matter if I like the person or not, I do the same - hug, maybe a couple of awkward words, goodbye, ruuuun. I give vibes that I am not interested, I am rushing home. How do you close your dates then in order to generate some healthy sexual tension, but also take it slow and steady","Awkward sidehug üòé my signature move, Aw yea"
datingoverthirty,13o2h38,1684693849.0,Does lack of conversational ability in OLD always translate real life? Is it worth it to push through?,"I (33F) am attractive and educated and have my shit together professionally. I get a lot of matches and actively engage with the men I match with on the apps (asking about stuff in their profiles, etc) but it often feels very one-sided, like I‚Äôm the only one asking questions and they feel they‚Äôve done their job by answering my questions and not asking anything about me in return. 

In these cases, I get bored/annoyed and let it fizzle, assuming they‚Äôre probably shit in real life if this is what they‚Äôre like on an app. However, I‚Äôm wondering whether it might be worth it to push through and see if they‚Äôre good in person and become much better at keeping in touch and asking questions once we‚Äôve actually met, because OLD is a giant dehumanizing cesspool. 

Have you had instances where someone who sucks at making conversation on an app is much better in person and via text after you‚Äôve met, or should I cut my losses?

I would need to see a noticeable improvement in texting after the date, or else fuck putting in the extra effort haha.","I've never found it worthwhile. Three is the magic number for me.

datingoverthirty,13n5hi7,1684612717.0,"I matched with a woman who became very emotionally attached with a week, then said some hurtful/angering things to me, and then has been trying to repeatedly contact me since I blocked her number. What can I do?","I (37M) matched with a woman (44F) on Okcupid earlier this year. We are both divorced and live in the same area - she has two kids, I have none.

I tend to be an open book, as is she, and we found ourselves commiserating over the issues in our previous marriages and the things we learned from those things, and we found ourselves getting into increasingly flirtatious conversation as well. at one point during this, perhaps because she might be too trusting upfront by her own admission, she revealed to me the name and address of her home business. This was later accompanied by at least one invitation to ""come over"" for a movie night with a flirty emoji. Mind you, at this point, we haven't even met in person, and my policy is to do first dates in public. So this gave me pause.

One day about a week after we matched, she suffered an injury in public going about her day and had to be hospitalized - ultimately she only had bruising, and was discharged the same day with a prescription for pain medication.

later that night, she reached out to me looking for a ""kind voice"", and asked if I could reveal my last name because she was suddenly feeling vulnerable about having given me her information previously. I called her to tell her that I need a little more time for stuff like that, because I had once been a victim of phone stalking and needed more time to trust. her response to this was outright hostility, and a demand ""that I get over my own bullshit"", and then she proceeded to corner me with interrogative questions about how many other women (from dating apps) I had opened up to about my life. I told her I didn't want to talk about this and she kept saying ""no, you're not getting out of this, answer the questions"". I I was so stressed by the end of the call, I was unable to sleep that night, and was even more disturbed that after the call she invited me over to her house once again (and with a flirtatious emoji).

I did not engage for several days. When she finally reached out, I told her that she had made me feel horrible and furious and extremely anxious. She apologized, blamed it on the pain medication which messed with her judgment during her phone call. I told her I needed to step away from this conversation. Then I blocked her phone number.

Flash forward a few weeks. She has found my last name and has reached out to me on a few different social media platforms with ""her side"" of the story. I read the message but chose not to enter the conversation, so much to her dismay, those messages remained ""unread"" on her end.

then yesterday, she called me again, this time from another phone number I did not recognize. When we did speak again I was immediately on edge and nervous once again. She could not understand why, and thought I was being irrational. she mostly wanted to know that her previous messages had been received, but expressed her anger at being blocked, especially by a man who she revealed her phone number and address to willingly.

She was nearly in tears as she made an impassioned plea for me to try and disregard all of the horrible things she said while she was high on pain medication. I reminded her that her hostile words and lack of boundaries had triggered very specific anxiety ""landmines"" that had been established during my previous marriage (ie: my fears and concerns being dismissed outright by someone who believes their feelings are more important).

We ended up chatting on the phone for about 90 minutes, mostly talking in circles. Although I could have hung up earlier I wanted to courteously provide as much info/closure as she would need (to start to move away from this). by the end of the call, in the voice of total defeat, she conceded ""well, I tried my best. best of luck to you"". that the call ended.

my problem now is that I am on edge as I anticipate yet another phone call from her. A mysterious phone number from my state called me earlier, and although I did not answer that one and it did not go to voicemail either, it sent me into a panic to see that call come in.

I told a close friend, a therapist, about this situation and the fear I was feeling - at one point my friend mentioned ""borderline personality disorder"". I myself have an anxiety disorder that sends me into catastrophic spirals worst case scenario thinking.

I worry about losing sleep over this situation. What should I do if she calls again? The heaviness of her emotions about all of this has left me feeling extremely anxious and ultimately exhausted. I have now told her twice that I need to step away from this conversation for my own mental health, even though she claims she is unable to emotionally understand why.

what can I do if and when she calls again? What can I do for my own peace of mind and to help myself relax about this situation?","You have a few options. If you want to be rid of her, then act like it and don't entertain her need to attach to you like she's drowning and you're a buoy. If you want to continue to be involved in this, then continue this dance with her.

You don't have to convince someone why they're not good for you. You don't have to reason with them and explain until they understand. You just have to enforce your own boundaries."

datingoverthirty,13n2lql,1684607954.0,"No response after the first date, and what's the proper etiquette?","Yesterday I \[M32\] had a first date with a girl \[F29\]. We had met on hinge, and then exchanged long whatsapp texts for almost two weeks until we had found a day that worked for both of us. The date itself felt like it went great, we had drinks and talked for 5 hours, laughed a lot and it seemed like we had good chemistry and a lot in common. At about 11pm she said that it was late and slowly needed to go home, but that she had really enjoyed it and couldn't believe how fast time went by. I walked her to her bus stop and then we parted ways.

When I got home I sent her a brief text that I really enjoyed the evening and wished her good night. Almost 24 hours later she still hasn't replied, which feels a little weird, given that we had been texting so much for weeks and she seemed to have enjoyed the date at least on a platonic level. What other reason would there be for someone to say that they did enjoy the date?

I'm aware that this most probably means that she's not interested in a romance, or that she at least needs to process her feelings. Maybe she's busy, maybe as an introvert she needs time to recharge first. Maybe I said or did something that turned her off, maybe I didn't come across as interested enough and left her confused. Not knowing because of ghosting does hurt. In any case, replying hasn't been a priority for her and obviously also has no obligation to reply.

In most cases, when someone didn't feel the chemistry after a date, I get a text that they had a good time or it was nice to meet, and then the conversation dies off, or they refuse a second date, or they say it felt platonic. I do the same when I'm the one who doesn't feel the vibe.

**Still, what is the proper ghosting etiquette here?**

1. I move on. This seems to be the common advice. But at the same time, with the uncertainty and lack of rejection, it still feels like she's worth pursuing.
2. I send a kind and polite follow-up message, maybe tomorrow, and then let it be. If I did that, what would that follow-up message say?

&#x200B;

**EDIT**: She replied this morning, saying that she really enjoyed the date! I hadn't sent a follow-up text yet after the first message. Apparently she had an emergency with her pet and a very stressful day and apologised for the late reply. I asked for a second date now.

This is nonetheless a very interesting discussion, but it seems that occasionally people just need time.","the dont double text rule is weird to me. people have lives, sometimes texts slip through the cracks. i‚Äôd wait a few days then send a follow up ‚Äúhey hope you‚Äôre doing well! would love to plan something if you‚Äôre free this/next weekend‚Äù if she responds great! if not move on. at least you tried."
datingoverthirty,13mjd5i,1684561729.0,How to let down somebody that may be sick,"I (F, around 35) met somebody during a speed dating event. It was a maybe on my side. I didn't feel any chemistry, but I believe it can kick in after a date or two.

He called me several days after the match and it was strange. He talked a lot about having to leave the city for a while several days afterwards, but clearly didn't want to talk about it - he replied to my gentle questions (""for work or pleasure?"") in an avoiding way, which was a no-go for me. We also talked about my job a lot - I made a mistake of mentioning where I work and it's one the jobs that everybody has an opinion about.

No chemistry, it happens.

Then he contacted me while being already away. He writes me text messages. After the first one I replied that since he didn't want to share info about the goal of his journey I wasn't sure what I could ask him and he replied with a text about his serious, life-threatening surgery. He's been contacting me every few days and I'm not sure how to end it.

On the one hand, I want to be kind. On the other, we hardly know each other, aren't close, and as much as I feel for him, if the story is true, I don't feel I have the mental capacity right now to support emotionally a person I don't know.","a nice rejection can be a kindness. He knows it's pushing a boundary to talk to someone he barely knows about this, even if you accidentally opened the door to finding out about this. He's not totally oblivious I'm sure.

datingoverthirty,13m2l7c,1684518503.0,Something you learned from dating and relationships specifically this last year?,"Obviously, we learn and evolve all the time. But what would you say is one sentiment you feel you really learned whilst dating or in a relationship the last year - something that you feel you really will take moving forwards? Be as personal and specific if you like, as shallow or sage as what you feel. 

My personal one - it‚Äôs such a cliche, but the red flags you ignore in the beginning always always always end up being the reasons something doesn‚Äôt work out. There is great cost further down the line when you ignore your initial intuition.

Also, long distance relationships are a no go for me ‚úãüèΩ","The biggest thing I've come to learn, is that the majority of the time, when someone's really attracted to you they'll make it easy to get to know them. 

And when someone's really attracted to you AND sees LTR compatibility, the majority of the time they'll make it easy to date them. 

People will usually find a way around poor circumstances and situations if they really see potential in someone.

This sounds like a ""duh!"" sort of thing to learn, but too often many of us rationalize away fickle/hot-cold/lukewarm interest and breadcrumbing because 1) our egos don't want to admit we're the 'placeholder' option for someone and 2) our low self-esteem thinks we can be magically fixed if we convince a low-interest person to change their mind, esp if we view this person as highly attractive in our minds (however we measure that metric). 

We also just don't like being alone. Makes sense, and it's hard to cut people off who aren't matching your energy, esp when they're the only ones giving you attention. 

But whatever's not meant for you, will continue to not be meant for you. So you can learn that lesson in a week, a month, 5 years, it's up to you! Keep doubling down on trying to make the wrong person the right one, and see if it works. 

But eventually you have to circle back around and start over, and find someone who genuinely wants to be with you. You can't live in delusion forever. 

That's been my biggest lesson."

I struggled with an eating disorder throughout my teens and 20s, and I‚Äôm only just starting to feel comfortable in my body after going through treatment. I‚Äôve built up a life for myself that I‚Äôm loving, and part of that is starting to include OLD.

He also commented about how he had never seen any nipples like mine before (they‚Äôre inverted) and that he could deal with it and it wouldn‚Äôt be a dealbreaker. I‚Äôve never had any negative comments about my boobs since high school. I feel so insecure after working so hard in therapy to feel okay with myself after nearly 2 decades of self abuse.

For example, I'd love a couples massage, a go-kart outing, a ski weekend, or a private lingerie show .. but your guy might prefer a beer tasting, a road trip to a stadium for a baseball game, a live band, or a fishing trip. The key is to tailor it to something he's expressed interest in!

Bonus points if its something that you two can establish as a bit of a tradition; a couple that are friends of mine are about ten years into a joint bucket-list to watch an MLB game at every stadium in the league. They even made sure to revisit the ones that only he or only she had visited in order to make sure they finish at the same time!"

I matched with someone a while ago who shared with me that they are autistic. 
I am meeting with them for the first time on Saturday and I was thinking of asking them whether there are any ways that his autism presents that he thinks I should be aware of. 
I don't want him over thinking things or being worried about how he is presenting himself.","Can I ask why you feel the need to ask?

Everyone has quirks and personality traits, some of which are less appealing than others - it isn‚Äôt a purely autistic thing. If you wouldn‚Äôt ask a neurotypical person ‚Äúcan I have a breakdown of how you act?‚Äù then you also shouldn‚Äôt ask it of an autistic person. I think you _are_ overthinking it and _are_ worried. 

And that‚Äôs OK. This is new territory for you, if your date‚Äôs autism presents in any way that is not to your liking, you can work on it if and when it arises.

Context: we'd already exchanged a few fun/jokey messages about food and interesting things we'd cooked/eaten recently. Paraphrasing, but the rest of the convo went something like this:

> Me: Do you know anyone who sees food as a necessary evil and just a survival thing? I've got a couple friends who do and I don't get it. Food is one of life's great pleasures IMO... a close second to the Fast and Furious franchise
>
> Her [4 days later]: Not really. Food is important in my culture and I gravitate towards people who feel similarly. Not sure what your intent was in bringing up food as a ""necessary evil."" I don't believe in ghosting and after giving it some thought, I have to be honest... alluding to eating disorders this early in conversation is quite alarming to me. Best of luck finding your person
>
> Me [almost immediately after her last message]: ??? I think there's been a miscommunication. I brought it up because I was talking to a friend who's all about efficiency, drinks Soylent, and doesn't care about the taste/experience of food, ha. Whereas you and I are both foodies who love cooking and trying new restaurants. I was trying to connect with you over a shared passion. Nothing to do with eating disorders

She didn't respond and ended up unmatching a couple days later. I'm still confused by how she got ""eating disorders"" from what IMO was an innocuous comment, but I understand that different people have different life experiences than me and might view things through a different lens, so I can accept that. It is a little annoying that she ignored my explanation and unmatched, but convos that go nowhere or end in unmatching are also par for the course in OLD.

Do you give your matches the benefit of the doubt in situations like this?","Your message was great...it gave her an opening to talk about food or movies. 


Unfortunately, you never know what will offend someone. It sounds like she (or someone she knew) had an eating disorder, so she's hypervigilant to any kind of ""negative"" food talk.

As an experiment, I asked Google Bard the following    
    
*Writing a dating profile how should describe myself based upon the following attributes; joker, thinker, go-getter, pilot and engineering designing a better world of tomorrow?*     
    
with the response 
     
*I'm a joker, a thinker, a go-getter, a pilot, and an engineer. I love to make people laugh, but I'm also a deep thinker who is always looking for ways to make the world a better place. I'm ambitious and driven, and I always set my sights high. I'm also a bit of a daredevil, and I love to push myself to the limit.

datingoverthirty,13k1wca,1684330394.0,Trust my gut or am I reading too much into this?,"I (M33) recently tried some OLD and basically want to vent a little and maybe ask for advice kind of.

I don't get a lot of matches and even when I do it's rare for it to lead to an actual conversation, but I did get one recently and we chatted a lot and it was going great for a bit. I even got her number and we started texting off the app. I asked her out and she said yes, but because of scheduling we couldn't go out until 6 days later. It was during this time I felt like it was kind of dropping off. She wasn't answering my texts as often, etc. I was hoping this was just because we had a plan to meet in person so maybe she wanted to save the conversation or something? But I couldn't shake this nagging feeling she was going to cancel when I hadn't fully heard from her in like 2 days.

Despite this I thought I was actually going to go on a date for once but then unsurprisingly she cancelled last minute saying ""my uncle is going to pass so I just need to find out if my dad wants company tonight"". But then it gets worse, when of course I graciously let her off the hook and told her she should be with family she seemingly changed her mind and was all 'oh actually I can come now, sorry for the false alarm' only to then cancel again later saying a bunch of her relatives were going to see her uncle and she didn't want to miss the chance.

My cynical mind just automatically assumes it's an excuse cause which makes me sad. I've had this kind of thing happen many times before. Basically I'll make a plan with someone. Then we won't speak again for a little bit and then day of they'll cancel. One time a girl actually told me she hoped I wouldn't follow up when we had a plan to meet on a Monday night when I was away for the weekend. With this most recent one, she apologized profusely and asked if i'd still be interested in going out again next week (i'm going out of town the rest of the week so it's the earliest option, something she knew in advance). I told her to let me know if she wants to reschedule but I am fully expecting never to hear from her again.  

Now I'll say the obvious part, this could be completely the truth, shit happens at inopportune times every day and I don't know her very well/she hasn't given me any tangible reason to assume she's lying, could be completely legit. Which brings me to my question, am I reading too much into this and follow up/try to go out again or should I trust my gut and just leave it and try and find someone else?  

I'm a very sensitive person, some would argue too sensitive, and because it happens so regularly even with friends/non dates I start to take it personally/expect it from people now which is something I don't like. I have no perspective on this so I'm coming here. 

What does everyone think?","Easier said than done, but try not to take it personally, even if she is making an excuse (which I‚Äôm not sure she is). 
The one thing I am going to be putting into practice with dating is to not approach with a scarcity mindset. I know it‚Äôs hard when you don‚Äôt get a lot of matches and hope builds up, but if you approach every dating situation as ‚Äúif not this, then something better,‚Äù even if the something better is you just getting to be a better version of yourself (through self-care, pursuing hobbies, traveling, finding new friends etc).

I (39F) went on a date last week with a very attractive man(35M). He asked me on another one this week, and I said yes, but there has been very little texting.

It seems I don't know how to find out if people want something serious or not. I always thought just asking them ""are you looking for a relationship?"" Would be enough, but after 2 years of only dating guys who answer ""yes"", and then them changing their mind after a couple of weeks or months, and then dumping me, I'm just not sure anymore.

What should I say or do? I feel completely lost. I'd really like a relationship, but after several short failed ones, I honestly don't know what to look for or expect anymore.

Should I just tell him I'm not feeling it because he's not texting me?

I've started with hinge and bumble, and I shared my number with a 30M a few days ago. We text a little each day, like 2 or 3 messages about what we're up to and our hobbies, shit like that. He is responding to my texts but sometimes it's literally 8-12 hours.

We haven't met yet so I don't expect him to text me all day but the time between texts feels weird, for ex: when it's me asking a simple question and I don't get a response for 8 hours during the week day. I understand some people can't text at work, but he works from home. 

My mind jumps to the conclusion of he's not interested when this happens. I feel annoyed but idk if it's actually warranted or if I'm being unrealistic.

* Some people want to schedule a date ASAP and text only for confirmation
* Some people want to schedule a date ASAP and text several times a day until the date.
* Some people want to get to know you over text for weeks before even voice chatting.
* Some people want to text and voice chat for a random length of time and then go on a first date that lasts for four hours and is pure magic, else considered a failure.

I'm a ""text/email for a few days then set up a date -- then only text/email at most once a day until the date"" person

Tomorrow we are checking out an art gallery and then getting dinner!

One thing I‚Äôm worried about though‚Ä¶

I live far away, but work in the city where he lives. I used to live in this city for many years and miss it, so I‚Äôm not bothered by going on dates there after work or even coming in on the weekends to do something fun.
However, I can understand that it‚Äôs less than ideal for the other person who has a million options that aren‚Äôt as far as I am. If I were in a relationship with someone in the city, I have ideas for both the short term and long term, but obviously that‚Äôs not something you‚Äôd share early on. I do call out in my profile that I‚Äôd like to meet someone that also want to do a city-beach hybrid life, and my date is aware of how far I am.

I suppose I‚Äôm looking for a bit of a confidence boost from people who‚Äôve been in similar situations. 

‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you date someone that lives closer to you?‚Äù I paid for premium on hinge and there are hardly any men on the apps where I live that I‚Äôm compatible with on just a foundational level (religion, politics, wanting children, type of relationship, etc.)","Sounds like a great topic to cover with them during the date. 

What sort of commute are we talking about here?

 Do they have transportation to where you live? Does the date ever see themselves moving away from the city? If the answer is no to either of those questions, then it would likely be a deal breaker for me."

The guy said he‚Äôd never encountered that before and found it a bit odd, but wasn‚Äôt against it, which I in turn found a bit odd. 

We are going to feel it out but was curious about people‚Äôs thoughts on this generally. Is my approach out of the norm? Are there any cons to it? I did have one instance where we agreed to be exclusive and then the guy sucked after, but it probably would have happened either way.

Some of your comments are warming my heart. Some make me question myself even more. 

To address some things that keep repeating: 

- I‚Äôve been on a healing process for many years and come very far. I‚Äôm making huge progress right now in unearthing core beliefs, hence, my imbalanced state currently. Slowly I‚Äôm leaning more and more towards secure mainly through deep friendships. Romantic relationships were not my focus for a while as I knew I had lots to work on. 

- many of you brought up the flight response as a major obstacle. Couldn‚Äôt agree more. I used to run away all the time but I‚Äôve been working hard on staying put for a few years and been doing so successfully. I know this is my instinct so I‚Äôve taught myself to recognise it and choose otherwise. It‚Äôs a real battle sometimes but I don‚Äôt quit. 

- the term ‚Äúproject‚Äù is used perhaps incorrectly. I do not expect any person to fix me besides myself. It‚Äôs unsustainable and impossible. I am the sole responsible for having a good life. If it implied I expect him to fix me - my bad. I practice awareness, sharing, and expressing my needs with him. I also make sure to ask him what he needs, loves, wishes for. I see him and make sure he knows he‚Äôs appreciated, exactly how he is. 
I will not refer to myself as a project anymore. 

- I‚Äôm really glad to read that so many of you would be open to date a person like me. After years of only dating ‚Äúperfect life‚Äù guys, my experience shows I relate much better to those with complex backgrounds as myself (self awareness and active effort to improve are a must, of course). 
So self-project people - I‚Äôm all in for you! 


__________________________________________

datingoverthirty,13hozq5,1684102229.0,"Worried about too high standards going forward, advice requested","Hi all,

35M here, sorry this is long.  A few months ago broke up with my partner of two years, and prior to that I had been married for 10 years, and that's about it in terms of relationships I've had.  

I know that I do want to be in a relationship with someone =, but I'm trying to balance my desire to not make a mistake with another person who isn't right for me, with my desire to actually be in a relationship again. 

To be specific: I've realized based on my previous relationships that there are some things I want in a future partner, in order of importance:


* Kindness, I realized after my divorce that my wife though kind to others, was not kind to me, most of the time.
* Child free, neither having kids previously of any age, nor wanting kids in the future.
* Honesty, My wife cheated on me, so honesty is important
* Monogamy, See above
* Financial stability/success - I need someone who has a career of some kind, enough to sustain themselves, I don't mind if I make more or contribute more, but it can't be a 95-5 situation like I've had in the past.
* Family/Friends - They have to get along with my friends well enough to be okay spending time with them sometimes, and same with my family.
* Ideology - I can't be with someone who has completely opposite beliefs, regarding politics/some moral questions.
* Beliefs - I'm part of a religious community and enjoy the friends I have there, but I have no need for someone to do so as well.  But they can't object to my involvement.  I don't think there's anything wrong with anyone who doesn't participate though, it's there prerogative. That said, it's common for members of my religious community to conflict with me ideologically, which I realize limits things.
* Considerate - Relatively neat/organized.   This includes being on time for things, I realized in my last relationship I get very anxious when I'm made to be late all the time because of my partner, or that I'm living in a mess.
* Attractive

I don't think the above is too big of a list, but I've never actually took the effort to write it down.  Having done that recently it's given me anxiety, and self-confidence issues, like ""who are you to demand so much"" sort of thing.

That all said I think I have a lot to offer, and as weird as it feels to do so, I'll list some things:  I'm successful in my career so financially stable/secure, I'm kind, empathetic, smart, funny, attractive, fit/healthy, self-reflective (via therapy), I'm organized/neat, honest, and am comfortable in long-term relationships.  But I'm also relatively quiet, I'm not ""the life of the party"" kind of guy, I have nerdy hobbies (comic book movies, video games), I do have limited breadth of relationship experience and I've been called stubborn.

So... I'd like some advice on this situation. Am I being unrealistic?  I'm not a perfect person obviously and I don't expect a perfect person, but I do think I have a lot to offer too and I really don't want to end up unhappy in life by compromising too much.  Happy to answer any questions, and appreciate feedback or any advice.","I don't think you're asking for much. It's just that you're asking for pretty much what everyone else is asking for at an older age where most people who have asked for the same things have already gotten married. It's just harder and there's more competition. I don't know what else to say.

To clarify, I'd agree with most of the things you want. I also get frustrated but I just say ""It is what it is"" and maintain hope that I'll find some cute gf someday."

I‚Äôm over dating at the moment, trying to take a break from the apps (with an occasional swipe, maybe once or twice a week) + leaving my self open to IRL connections. 

My last relationship ended last August. Prior to that, hadn‚Äôt had a casual sexual anything for about a 8-10 months or so. And very few times in the 3 years prior. 

I‚Äôve been wanting to find a physical connection for a while, but I don‚Äôt know if the kind of arrangement I‚Äôd be comfortable with is actually out there (or easy to come by, and at that point, might as well put that energy into finding my actual partner).

The main problem with FWB setups is that they rarely ever live up to the ‚Äúfriend‚Äù part, whether in interaction, respect levels or otherwise. 

I LOVE sex. A lot. I love it so much that I plainly refuse to have bad or mediocre sex. Im also not motivated by sex enough to have sex with someone who I don‚Äôt actually want to spend time with or get to know. I‚Äôm a busy person, so spending time JUST for sex is a non starter for me. 

I think the best sex comes from getting to know someone a bit and creating the space to feel liberated in the bedroom, etc. 

Also, as a woman, the risk of sex being mediocre in a FWB situation is especially high ‚Äî for a few reasons ‚Äî one being that we live in a society that prioritizes male pleasure and ~generalization~ most men are taught that sex revolves around their penises. Without an investment in the other person, it‚Äôs easy to simply make sex about getting yourself off. 

The kink community makes it, in some ways, a little easier to get the ongoing person-to-person investment ‚Äî so I‚Äôm reintroducing myself to that world to see what might work. On the other hand, my problem with kink community has always been that SO MANY men in the community often jump straight into all things sexual *because* it‚Äôs the kink world.

I alluded to this-in poor taste-but while saying that if he is talking to someone else Ill still be 100% there for him regardless. I didnt say it in any negative way- just wanted him to feel happy even if its with someone else. His response felt like he thought I had crossed a line by noting his activity, he didnt deny it and just said something like it was excessjve for me to expect texts every few hours (and that wasnt true- I only got anxious because he was online but wasnt msging).

He stopped being responsive for days at a time after I said it..and now continues with that pattern.

We never defined what we were. And this doesnt seem like the right time to bring up relationship stuff but I guess I did in a weird way anyway (via talking about his online status). I feel like a horrible person. But now his pulling back makes me question if I will even be allowed to help him through all this or if he wants me to just move on: yes i said and did something awful during a difficult time for him (i apologized tho I know that isnt enough and hes thinking about bigger stuff currently) and he is allowed to fade me out because he is going through an awful hardship. But Im in limbo and not sure what is the right thing to do: for himself but also for me.

For context:

I‚Äôm (30f) at a stage that I realise I want a relationship but not exactly feeling 100% ready‚Ä¶ I love intimacy and the physicality of sex but im tired of the mugginess and lack of satisfaction that I feel from casual encounters as of late. 

Having moved back to my mothers during the pandemic (which was such a transformative period of my life- the growing pains were real) I‚Äôm feeling like I‚Äôm close to being able to move out and get my own place in the next few months. I also had a bit of a shitty breakup last year that has left me feeling particularly vulnerable- it‚Äôs the kind of relationship that - even though he wasn‚Äôt the most emotionally available or supportive partner- really made me aware of my own insecurities and flaws and my tendency at the time to project. 

Since then I genuinely feel like I‚Äôve turned my life around and am closer to living the life that I‚Äôve been pushing myself to achieve:
- I have a career in the creative sector after deciding to switch careers at 25, it‚Äôs been a struggle but now I‚Äôm at a point that I‚Äôm being requested/headhunted which makes me proud of how far I‚Äôve come 

-I‚Äôm pushing myself in my creative endeavours collaborating actively with other people

-I‚Äôm active and go to the gym and I‚Äôm looking the best I‚Äôve looked on my life

-I‚Äôm more financially liquid and close to paying off all my debts (it wasn‚Äôt a lot to begin with but was definitely a weight on my mind)

-I‚Äôve recently passed my driving test and have bought a car and been on the road for 7 months. 

Having my own place is the cherry on top for me but I also recognise that it will present its own challenges especially reacclimatising to living by myself. I don‚Äôt want to start looking for a relationship knowing that this period of change and readjustment is coming up
-considering the very painful outcome that came from engaging in one during my last significant period of change. 

I‚Äôm thinking that during this time celibacy could help prepare myself to be holistically ready to meet someone for the long term. The idea being if I instill boundaries with myself it would be easier to implement boundaries with others and weed out the riff raff while relearning healthy patterns‚Ä¶

Anyone have any success with this? Or just general thoughts? Would love to hear other stories !


***UPDATE***

So I‚Äôve seen a lot of questions regarding the length of time that I‚Äôm thinking about doing this for and what I actually mean by being celibate. 

Ideally I was thinking however long it takes for me to move out of the family home and settled into a routine for myself. So maybe 4-6 months? 


The reason I‚Äôm thinking that specifically is because even though moving out is something I really want to do (and have previously lived away from home for 9 years) my family home is quite big with currently five of us being here and visits from my siblings and their family. I know it will take a period of adjusting and I really want to be comfortable in my own skin. I know myself well enough to know that the loneliness that will inevitably come is something that may push me towards making decisions that aren‚Äôt exactly the best for myself. Like lots of casual encounters (which over the past year and a half I‚Äôve had enough of) or fwbs and situationships. 


In regards to what I mean by celibate- I‚Äôd probably still go on dates but not have sex and not engage in fwbs- but will probably withhold on dating until I‚Äôve moved out (I have an overly involved family that don‚Äôt necessarily understand boundaries). I think sex clouding my judgement can be a real thing for me and I may have been tying some of my self-worth into some of these encounters. But I‚Äôm thinking of it like I would with how I‚Äôve tried to lose weight- which I can‚Äôt do if I don‚Äôt put the work in and have a diet of junk food. 

I‚Äôll get around to replying to some comments but I have to say it‚Äôs been interesting to read people‚Äôs opinions and has definitely given food for thought!","for clarity here, do you mean celibacy as in avoiding dating/men altogether, or dating people longterm while avoiding sex?

>The idea being if I instill boundaries with myself it would be easier to implement boundaries with others and weed out the riff raff while relearning healthy patterns‚Ä¶

I think if you set boundaries for yourself like waiting 5, 10, whatever dates to have sex you can weed out people who are less committal in many cases, sure. But I'm not sure how long you count celibacy as. For me I wouldn't even think of that as celibacy, it's too brief. So if we're saying waiting 6 months, it might also weed out completely normal, healthy people as well. I'd caution that in the quest to avoid flakes, not to veer into demonizing people for wanting sex *at some point* in a serious, committed relationship.

I would worry that if you take an all or nothing approach for months, you'll find yourself in the same position in the future once you're ready to have sex - unsure of how to navigate having sex *while also* upholding what you want in a serious partnership.

(but absolutely, if you don't feel up to having sex - don't!)"

This has nothing to do with your profile, that's all after the fact. You might want to take a closer look at how your interactions are going. Are you coming off needy?

datingoverthirty,13fb49d,1683866982.0,Did I (F33) mess up by wanting exclusivity at 5 weeks?,"Hi everyone, looking for advice. What's the minimum amount of time a guy should take to be exclusive with you? And what's the maximum? I'm worried I might have expected exclusivity too soon and messed things up. 

I broke it off with a guy because he wouldn't be exclusive with me after 5 weeks of dating and acting like my BF, texting me daily and seeing each other once or sometimes twice a week (sleepovers, 8+ hour long dates - I don‚Äôt do sex without exclusivity) but also not making me feel like much of a priority between work and friends - I always got the leftovers. It wasn‚Äôt escalating over time. 

The precipitating event was that he blew me off one evening because of last minute work drinks and I was disappointed that he ditched our plans when we hadn‚Äôt seen each other for a week and didn‚Äôt really apologize or ask when else I was free. He said ‚Äúthis feels like a relationship lecture‚Äù, and I wondered what this was, if not a relationship, because he was acting like a BF in every other way. 

He said he needed more time to get to know each other because he'd previously jumped into relationships too quickly and got really hurt as a result, and I said he should have enough data on me upon which to make a decision at that point.  

Then he asked me to reconsider continuing to see him still WITHOUT being exclusive a week later, and I said I'd had a first date with someone I like so was fine to date him and this other guy if he needed more time, but he said that he had only been dating me and didn't want to be in competition with one other guy that I liked ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. Not sure what would have happened if I had just said I wanted to date generally without referring to one guy in particular. 

He said he would message me when he was in a better place to escalate to a relationship, but he never did, and 3 months later now he‚Äôs been seeing someone else for a few weeks and wants nothing to do with me üòû. Made his dating profiles private and everything, so I imagine that‚Äôs what he did with me too at the time ü•≤. 

Did I mess this up? I feel like I did. I assume I can‚Äôt do anything now because he‚Äôs focused on someone else. So much regret it‚Äôs eating me up üòû. He was great.","I think that you can't really ""mess up"" something like this. if what you wanted and what he wanted were not in sync, then it's a good thing (not a mistake) that you discovered that.

datingoverthirty,13extpe,1683834374.0,Gut feelings?,"I need some advice please. 

I 31F met 31M on Hinge, we talked for the first 1.5 months and clicked. When we met we clicked even more. He is very nice, considerate, funny, cute, intellectual and my main biggest thing is creative and he has it all. Great. 

London is really going through the motions, everyone is getting kicked out of their rentals, work isn't steady - this includes us both, beforehand we've had steady flats and work. I'm in-between sublets yet landed a big job, he's trying to find a place and figure out what work he wants. Career and money isn't a big thing for me, living your authentic self and being creative is. 

We both have mental health problems and traumatic childhoods - but it is important for me to be with someone who understands trauma. I have PTSD and depression and I'm doing well, I'm focused in the right choices in a healthy balanced life - I still like to have a big blow out once in a while with friends, at a party, festival, within reason and having purpose. 

31M is wanting to take the right choices too, he wants to find a good place to live, is doing viewings, looking at work, be in a longterm thing with me. He is feeling manic and trying to get back on meds but the NHS is so difficult here for it to be streamline - I have experienced this too and its incredibly off-putting. 

On one of our great dates I had a gut feeling of ""this isn't right"" - I thought it was intrusive thoughts which is something I have experienced before and self jeopardising. I haven't been dating since November as I took a break to focus on myself, projects and uneasiness of living, and now I met someone who I'm thrilled by, am I picking holes at it in defence?

We've both have had issues with alcohol and substances, I have a good grasp on mine so far within reason, I have a gut feeling what if he doesn't? I'm scared to commit with someone who isn't able make the healthy changes they say they want in life. I don't want to force someone to my projection of a partner, we need to enhance and support each other in life. 

I have lived with my old best friend in my previous flat for a few years who is a ketamine addict and I think this has made it jarring for me. I don't want to be fixing someone yet people do deserve the time and help. I am willing to be with him on this journey but I can't make him do it, he needs to be willing to. 

He did an all-nighter with his friend and started to spiral a bit, I didn't know what to say... so I said something along the lines of - don't worry, take a nap, drink some water, there is always tomorrow 

The gut feeling is that I'm worried to get involved with someone who is as vulnerable as me. Sorry if this is waffle - I'm quite in my head atm. Thanks for reading

Edited: I misunderstood trauma bonding lmao for oversharing nvm",I‚Äôm a firm believer that a good relationship should bring out the best in both people. This sounds like you‚Äôd be trying to bring out the best of him to the detriment of yourself.

Someone who would be scared off by a ""how's your day going?"" text or an admission that being with them makes me happy...that person is not for me! And that's fine. Trying to be cooler or more aloof than I really am is a waste of time - because who I am is *fine*, actually. I do the work. There's nothing wrong with me. I'm punk but I'm also a sensitive lil thing who wants attention sometimes. Good for me. 

It doesn't matter who texted who last, or which of us was the last to open up a little, or whatever. We're not playing games, we're building relationships (friendships, bed buddies, romance, whatever, it's all relationships). I often recognize the undercurrent of power dynamics running through these situations - if I text first, or if I say ""you make me feel safe"", I'm giving them the power of knowing they can hurt me. 

Vulnerability is dangerous when it leads you towards codependence. Having someone know I trust and like them feels like giving them access to edit the story I tell myself about myself - because other people's stories about me, in the past, have completely overridden my own. I spent decades adopting my abusers' stories about who I was. It's only the past few years that I have really started to overcome that. 

It's scary to feel like you are giving someone else permission to tell you who you are - because they might tell you that you're horrible, ugly, worthless. But it's healthy to let other people tell you who they think you are - that's how growth happens, often, and *most* people you let into your life to that extent will have your best interests at heart. They will want to tell you the good things they see. They will want you to hear them and believe them when they say: I like you, you are good. And if they start telling you things you don't want to hear, you might say ""they do have a point, I can be stubborn, maybe I can work on that"" or ""I get what they're saying, but I like my sense of humor and I'm not changing it"" or ""they are being cruel to me for reasons I do not need to understand, I'm not going to listen to their story about me anymore."" 

Anyway. That was a lot of rambling when really all I wanted to think about was how can I be more confident in just saying/doing what I feel inclined to say/do without worrying about losing ground in some invisible competition I'm having with the other people in my life. But in other news, FWB2 is taking me on a road trip to an amusement park next weekend and I'm VERY excited :)"

But we've now gone on a handful of dates, kissed once and... nothing. Ever since the first date, I've felt a total lack of romantic chemistry and don't look forward to kissing him. 

Has this happened to anyone?? I'm so disappointed and confused by my reaction cause of the level of intense excitement I felt over him before, and now it's just.... gone.

Anyways, last time I saw him was on Valentine‚Äôs Day as he was in my city again shooting. We spent the night and day together, really great time again.

He left, we remained in touch but I could feel the energy shift. He felt distant but because of the distance and my move to a different country in 3 months we knew nothing romantic would ever form between us.

Last week I travelled to his city with a friend. I told him I was around. He came to pick me up and we had lunch together. He was still friendly but just a totally different person so I asked him about his dating life and he told me he has a gf.

I Dont wanna lie, it hurt. I am rational enough to know that it was going to happen at some point but yeah it hurt a lot. I even wanted to be alone to cry a bit, because all the moments between us played back in my head.

Anyways, today for the first time he posted his gf on his Instagram. I teared up. He looks very happy and I‚Äôm honestly happy for him but it still makes me sad. I muted him so I don‚Äôt have to see his stories.

He is a good guy. One of the best I‚Äôve ever been with and he just puts a lot of effort into making sure a person feels valued. In my case, this happened despite knowing there would never be a relationship. I don‚Äôt want to villainize him or get rid of him. He never did anything wrong.

Is it ever a good idea to continue to follow people on social media after things end? Especially if there is no bad blood but some residual feelings ? I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm making sense here","Don‚Äôt follow anyone that you don‚Äôt want to see updates on. You don‚Äôt really even know this guy, it‚Äôs totally reasonable that now that your romantic relationship is over, you don‚Äôt want to see his new gf. If he has a problem with you unfollowing him, who cares? You‚Äôre not dating, you probably won‚Äôt even see him again. Do what‚Äôs best for you!"

datingoverthirty,13b86at,1683505753.0,What have you learned about yourself from all the dating you've done?,"Hey friends!

So, I was thinking, we can assume that being this age and single, we have dated for quite a while now, right?  And what have you learned about yourself during all this time dating?

I like to journal a lot since I was 9 years old or so. Not daily of course but just every now and then open my journal and write stuff; sometimes its quotes I like, sometimes stories and sometimes just like feelings I have. Recently I went back to my journals of the last two years and tried to extract what I have learned about myself during all these dates that I've had because as Shakespeare said: 

&#x200B;

>For the eye sees not itself/ But by reflection

 Anyways, let me share a bit of what I've learned:

* I know I have great affinity with people close to their family and that crave a family of their own.
*  I also learned my love language is quality time and physical touch. 
* I now know I‚Äôd love to be with someone that I admire for whatever reason, from being the best at macrame or being an Olympic athlete, I just love when they have a burning passion and express it.
*  I also know I love vulnerability and try to repay it as best as I can, even though I know that‚Äôs priceless and it is to be cherished forever as the best of my treasures.
* I also know that it is hard to be bear my OCD and that I am odd (truth be told I already knew that but eh, got some sort of reaffirmation I guess) and so, I‚Äôm more of an acquired taste I guess. 

Hopefully knowing this will help me find my person or idk, have a keener eye when dating.

So, what have you learned about yourself?","I‚Äôve learned that my intuition is on point 100% of the time. Even if I get a weird feeling about someone (not necessarily bad) and I don‚Äôt know yet, it will always soon reveal why

That my many years of being single is hard on me. I thrive best in relationships and just now I‚Äôm learning to compromise a bit more on what‚Äôs important to me in a relationship and what isn‚Äôt. I value partnership a lot, but still not willing to settle for someone I‚Äôm not into. 

Being true to myself is important. In that way I also attract authentic relationships and people who are true to themselves. 

Everything and everyone is changing, nothing is constant which means all we can do is be in the now and stop trying to predict an outcome or the future, because we have no control.

Selfies taken nearly every day, poses of them making sexy faces all the time, etc‚Ä¶  It is something I have always been wary of and will actively cause me to not match with the person, because I believe there‚Äôs a big difference between confidence in yourself and glorifying yourself, yet so many people tend to lean towards the latter, even at our age.

Or are my instincts correct that excessive social media usage (especially when it comes to photos taken of yourself) is a red-flag?","No, it's fucking weird and makes me super uncomfortable, like they probably have a personality disorder or something.

datingoverthirty,13avhb0,1683477249.0,On and off for a year. Help me figure it out.,"Probably gonna be a long read, so I apologize and appreciate any feedback or advice:

So I (M37) met A (F34) last year, we matched on a dating app. Instantly clicked. It was love at first sight on our first date. Ive never had that kind of immediate chemical reaction with someone. Let me preface it by saying its a very complicated situation. 6 months prior, she had just gotten out of a 15 year marriage that had turned abusive. They lived halfway across the country, her husband started cheating, became abusive in every way, she took their two girls and moved here to be close to family. 

I could tell immediately that she was very kind of awkward socially and just really wasn't aware of how a healthy, normal relationship works. I would do normal things for her and she would be shocked or skeptical, so it was a learning experience for her, just in basic communication, affection, etc. I knew I had to have A LOT of patience and understanding, and I have. After a couple of great months, her ex started manipulating her and trying to get her back, and she was torn, didn't know what she wanted, so she said she needed to take a break. We didn't really speak much for a couple of months, then we kind of randomly reconnected and decided to try it again.

The last 6 or so months have been amazing. I've never loved anyone as much as I love her, and I've grown to love her girls as well. They have told me/us several times about how they want us to be together and get married, how I treat them better than their Dad ever did, etc. Its really been everything I have spent my life looking for. There have still been some struggles as far as her communication skills, me having to try to not be clingy, stuff like that, but for the most part, its been just amazing. 

Up until about a month ago. So we live about 30 minutes apart, so we don't get to see each other too terribly often, between work schedules, etc. Just depends. Our main form of communication is phone and text. We had a great conversation one night, and then she ghosted me for about a week. She then finally messaged me and said that she was dealing with a bout of depression and that her reaction is to withdraw and shut the world out, that she was really struggling. So I made sure she knew I was here for her if she needed to talk. After a few more days, stuff went back to normal. Then a couple of weeks go by, and she ghosts me again. After a few days, she messages me back and says that she just doesn't have the time or energy to devote to a relationship and that she jumped into this too fast and that I need to move on without her. She talked about how she was just too damaged from her marriage, her life is too busy with work and the kids, etc. I get it. 

Of course, I plead my case, and ask if there is anything we can do to make it work, etc. Then it seemed like she started trying to come up with reasons to end it. She started mentioning how she wasn't sure we aligned because of memes ive posted on FB, just really out of left field stuff, stuff that has never been mentioned or talked about before. So me being me, I asked her that if im still single, if and when she decides she's ready for a relationship, would she like to try again with me and she said yes, absolutely. So I proposed we just kind of stay friends for now and try that. 

Strangely enough, the next day, things go back to normal, like nothing ever happened. So I asked her to come see me this weekend if she had the chance, and she said for sure. Then I havent heard from her since Friday. She has seemingly ghosted me again. And here we are.

This constant up and down, back and forth is just so emotionally taxing on me. We've had deep discussions about marriage, we've talked  about the kind of wedding we'd have, we've talked about what kind of house we'd look for when we reached that point. Ive pretty much staked my future on being with her and her girls, and now I dont even get so much as a response. I know the logical thing for me is to just end it and move on but I've never loved someone as much as her and it's almost an impossible thought. Any advice?","Someone coming out of a completely healthy 15 yr marriage would need time to adjust and find themself.  Someone coming out of an ABUSIVE relationship in which the ex is still in their life and assumably even co-parenting‚Ä¶.is going go need a lot more time to adjust, heal and find themself.  

Let her go.  If you care about her then stop pleading your case - the last thing she needs is someone else swaying her, influencing, suggesting, pushing, making her feel guilty or bad in any way.  You can certainly say ‚Äúwhen you‚Äôre ready you can reach out‚Äù - but don‚Äôt wait.  Don‚Äôt check in.  She needs to do this on her own with her already existing friends, family and hopefully a therapist.

You‚Äôre being selfish by doing anything else.  And she doesn‚Äôt need that."

datingoverthirty,13alife,1683460326.0,Feeling burnt out and discouraged when it comes to OLD,"So I‚Äôve been giving OLD quite a go the past 4 months, and I am left completely burnt out and discouraged so far, I know it‚Äôs a numbers games, but somehow it doesn‚Äôt feel like this. 
The more I keep going,
the more I am getting discouraged in actually finding something real.

There were a couple of guys I connected with, but nothing ever truly took off. Except for some little attachment with one or two guys, as we were spending more and more time together. the longest was probably
7 weeks (he had to move out of London)

So I‚Äôm starting off again, another round of flakes, same old questions, and more drinks! 

Anyone else feeling the same lately? What do you do when you feel like this?
Do you just step back? Or do you persist? 

I‚Äôm focusing a lot on my hobbies, and work. But I admit that the couple dynamic is what I‚Äôm missing at the moment (this could particularly be, because my family lives in another country, and being in a big city and single .. it feels like I don‚Äôt have anyone to call family over here - I was married before, so I guess that became my family)","The problem is the concept of OLD is too intentional. When you meet someone in the wild by happenstance you typically cultivate a relationship that you weren't looking for and is unexpected. Less pressure. When you go on a first date with someone you match with from OLD, the whole purpose of the meeting is to find a person who can be a potential partner. So even without realizing it we are assessing this stranger for compatibility immediately. No one can measure up to that. So we all end up disappointed and this leads to people who flake, ghost, let situationships go on too long, or even don't give someone a fair shot. I think it's just an unnatural way to go about it but it's the world we live in."

Anyone else experiencing this? How does one solve it? It‚Äôs awful, I end up rejecting amazing and very potential long term partners that are great and treat me as a princess for no reason, just because I get bored talking to them. But I get bored most of the times and feel constantly unsatisfied with interactions. 

I‚Äôm currently undergoing the same situation: a 10000% keeper reaching the end of the high initial rush. 
Did I just got too used to being single and hence forget how to commit, it‚Äôs not stimulating enough or what?

Best,

Edit: Very interesting comments. Thank you for your time and help, appreciated. I‚Äôm writing down some of your ideas and will be reflecting on them.",Addicted to the honeymoon phase! I had an ex that was like that. It was exhausting after awhile because she always wanted it to be new and exciting. Treated like a princess. I kept up with it for a year or two because I really loved her but eventually I figured out what I really wanted in a relationship. Someone that adds a net positive to my life. Do you really want to change though? It seems like a very lonely existence to be moving from one thing to the next and almost a coping strategy to never have to get close to someone.

I‚Äôm 32F and have been casually dating this 44M for I guess about 2 months now but have known each other since 2019. The past couple of weeks in particular, I‚Äôve noticed myself being really distracted by thoughts of him and I know it‚Äôs a mutual experience as he told me the same (unprompted from me). 

I find it really unbelievably awesome in some ways. My mind and body haven‚Äôt felt anything like this with anyone before, at least not in the past 12 years. In other ways it‚Äôs extremely bothersome though, particularly when it comes to sleeping. I keep finding myself up well past my usual sleep time and regularly waking up hours earlier than usual & it‚Äôs the same for him even though we don‚Äôt engage with each other in those hours. 

I can‚Äôt speak for him but for me the intrusive thoughts specifically preventing my sleep are positively hyper focused on our bedroom fun. But seriously no amount of ‚Äútaking care of ourselves‚Äù is working to calm the thoughts and I‚Äôm growing tired of being tired. 

It‚Äôs a great problem to have but also a terrible one as I do feel like my life is starting to get a little messy and unhinged. We both *really, really* thought the days of experiencing this primal, visceral, commanding feeling we‚Äôre behind us!

During the holiday part of the trip, I planned to go to London and just taking a little peek around, I matched with him around 7-8 weeks ago. We‚Äôve been talking mostly everyday and overall things have been going on amazingly! We finally met on Sunday and it was amazing to say the least!

However, I‚Äôm now in this stage of feeling everything is over now but I felt a very strong and high emotional connection with him. We haven‚Äôt stopped talking and we even kinda talked about how it‚Äôs not possible of him even going to visit me kinda soon. 

I can extend my trip for a few days after the things from work and I‚Äôm seriously considering doing so but I don‚Äôt wanna come off as too intense (which I already am, anyway). 

I wanna ask him first how did he feel about what happened during the weekend, then open up and tell him how I feel and then see if we‚Äôre on the same page and pop my proposal. I‚Äôm not gonna tell him about the idea of extending if he‚Äôs not in the same page but I‚Äôm scared of doing such a bold movement.

Update!

So I came clean to him. I opened up first and told him that I‚Äôm very attracted to him, that things went much better than expected and I‚Äôd love to see him again so was wondering how did he feel about it all. 

He then replied back thanking me for opening up and that he‚Äôd do the same. He also liked a lot the time we spent together and that he doesn‚Äôt take this kind of things lightly so he was so glad it was with me. He then said he‚Äôd want a more emotional attachment with someone more accessible than me (due to the distance) and that our lives are in different points and directions. But if somehow I end up back in London, he‚Äôd absolutely love to see me again. 

I then told him that I‚Äôd love to know what he thinks about me extending my trip and heading back to London to spend more time together and he said that he‚Äôs gonna be super busy for the next weekends so unfortunately that‚Äôs not a possibility. It was all in good terms and I feel at peace with everything! Thank you very much to everyone who sent their great advice and took the time to read and reply on this.

Try to shift it to ""I'm going to enjoy this for as long as it lasts.""

His issues are not your issues to burden yourself with.  Taking on his emotional labour is going to make you worse off down the road. Is he meeting your needs right now?  Has he given any indication (other than just words) that he's going to reach those goals in a very short timeline? No?  Then move on.  

If you should reconnect in the future when he's dealt with his issues, then great, but in most of these cases, this is just an easy excuse to stop progressing a current relationship."

It also takes me a while to open up and be vulnerable I.e it‚Äôll be hard and in organic for me to share all my hearts desires wishes, traumas with someone within the first couple of dates.

It is also a realisation that OLD moves too quickly for me and my emotions to keep up. A timeline that OLD to expects given most people tap out at date 3-5.

While I get it, my personal recommendation (that some of you may hate, it's fine, feel free to chime in) is that we have to accept that we're not in our teens/20s anymore and that comes with many lifestyle changes, including this.

It's VERY common to have friendship-turned-relationship encounters when you're young because there are so many other single people in your friend groups. In my friend groups now though, 99% of the time if I go to a party my friends are throwing, there is one other single person present, and there's a 50% chance it's another woman. 

Of course you can throw yourself into events and meetups and sports and sometimes that *is* a great way to allow for the slow burn.

But even then, a lot of people have adjusted to the ""ask me out if you like me"" pacing of online dating and won't get it if you want to hang out for three months before expressing interest. 

So sometimes I think it's worth taking the plunge, try to face your fears over showing interest *before* you're totally sure of what you're getting in the other person. 

You can still build up steady companionship with someone without having to be completely vulnerable and sharing all your traumas within the first 3 dates! I don't think most people expect that. 

But if you expect to only be testing people for conversational compatibility for 3-5 dates and never getting deep, then yeah, I would encourage you to push yourself a bit. It's just not going to work for most people to keep dating surface-level for that long. It's a huge commitment of time and energy in your 30s to keep meeting up with someone."

Officially broke up with my long distance BF start of March (had been in each others lives for over a year) because he was distancing himself and made really abusive comments. I won't divulge what they were as its too graphic and upsetting. 

March and April we still kept in touch and even met up once, though it remains very volatile and highly charged and he continued to make very nasty comments to me. He was thrown out of my house by my housemates because he got in a rage one day and I was scared for my safety. 

It is so shocking because when we first got together he was the most supportive, emotionally available boyfriend and was a source of strength and stability for me. Its such a shocking, hurtful fall from grace that I never saw coming.

I finally cut all contact with him last Thursday and blocked him on everything, and yesterday I went on my first night out since all this happened. I ended up going home in tears a couple hours in cos I was just so heartbroken and alcohol was making me feel worse.

When I got home, he has sent me another email from a different email address asking me to make contact with him, I replied and told him to please leave me alone and let us both heal, and to stop this toxic cycle once and for all.

I really feel like I have lost so much, and feel quite hopeless about the future. Even though I know he was treating me badly and logically I do not want to be around that anymore, it still really hurts and it feels like I can't even enjoy little things anymore like going for a night out with my friends.

I'll be honest, I don't think you should be asking about how long it takes to get over this relationship, yet.  You haven't figured out how to extract this guy from your life to even start that process.  As of \*yesterday\* he was still violating your boundaries and trying to insert himself.  I think Step 1 is going to be to figure out how to finally remove him, hopefully your e-mail yesterday did it, but otherwise you may need to A.) stop replying to him entirely and B.) consider getting LE involved if he won't back off.

I (39f) matched with a guy (40m) a few weeks ago. We met up for an afternoon coffee, hit it off and walked around the city and talked until he had to get back to work. We were able to meet up again a couple of days later before he left town for the weekend, and it happened to be my birthday. He was incredibly sweet and brought me pastries from a local bakery and made sure one was my favorite flavor that I had mentioned in conversation. To me, that was so sweet and thoughtful. We had a lovely time with a nice lunch and walk around a park. It was the nicest birthday I have had in a while, and told him so.

We continued to text daily, sharing about our days and sending pictures. Several nights we talked for 2-3 hours on the phone after our kids were in bed. We discovered we have a lot in common, from political and religious views, to sharing the pain of our ex-spouses cheating, and just a mutual attraction and ease with each other. 

We were able to meet up again a couple of days after he got back (he was texting me and sending me pictures throughout the trip), and again had a great time just talking while walking in the park and taking a drive to nowhere. We've held hands and kissed/made out, which we both enjoyed. He also made it clear that he found me attractive, even saying things like he ""can't believe this beautiful woman wants to kiss me"". But I see him as incredibly attractive too and definitely don't think we're mismatched there either. 

As to the confusion, to me there has been clear words and actions that told me he was not only genuine, but also really liked me. And the feeling was mutual. But it wasn't a love bombing situation, it was just a ""hey, we like each other"" situation. Or so I thought. But then when I brought up hoping to see him this week before I left for a trip, he suddenly drops this message on me and it is completely contrary to everything else he has done and said so far:

""OP, I feel a little overwhelmed at the moment between work and (kid's name). I like you and you‚Äôre a super sweet, pretty woman, but I just don‚Äôt know if I am capable of being in a relationship right now. To be honest with you, I have been hurt majorly twice in my life and I think I‚Äôm just scared. I‚Äôm just being honest with you about my feelings and didn‚Äôt want you to think I was leading you on. I hope you understand.""

Is this just another way to say, ""it's not you, it's me""? It feels like this came out of nowhere when things seemed to be going so well. And if this guy wasn't actually interested in me, then I give up, because he was doing everything to indicate that he was.","It sounds like you and him hit it off swimmingly and he realized he‚Äôs actually not ready for a relationship. 

I was him before. It had been a few months after a serious relationship and I thought maybe I was ready. Went on a date and realized I was not and got off apps. A few more months pass, I try again, have a few more dates, get a little further and realize nope still got some work to do. 

It sounds like that‚Äôs what he realized. I think you read all the signals right, he likes you and is very interested! But he‚Äôs just not there and it really is him, not you. I do think it‚Äôs real and you just never know what the other person is going through. 

Still, it sucks but I hope it doesn‚Äôt discourage you. If you found this guy, you‚Äôll find another!"

After I made the post, I didn‚Äôt contact him anymore, after a couple of days, he texted me again to wish me a happy Orthodox Easter and ask about how my mum‚Äôs visit is going. Then I think he texted once during the week to wish a happy day forward and I did the same a few days later. He is being very sweet over text and sends kisses, etc. The weekend comes and he asks me if I am still travelling for work, I say No, I am back, but he doesn‚Äôt initiate a meetup. I tell him ‚Äúdo you want to meet up during the week and chat, I feel it would be good‚Äù. I needed some closure and to clear the confusion in my head, even though I knew it could made me more sad, but at least I wouldn‚Äôt keep hope. He said Yes and then he texted me again on Sunday morning to ask how I am and wish a good day etc. 

We meet on Wednesday, it takes me some time to start the conversation, so we have a light dinner and then on the way back to the car, I ask him to grab a seat on a bench. I ask him if he knew why I asked to see him, he says ‚Äúbecause you wanted to see me and hang out?‚Äù i say ‚Äúwell, this is not entirely not true, but this is not the main reason‚Äù. So I tell him that I don‚Äôt expect that anything has changed in his side, but I admit I thought J never would hear from him again and then he texting me kind things confuses me. He says some thing that can be summarized as ‚ÄúWhen I came back home after beinf with family I had a lot of emotions and thoughts about what I want from this country and then we also had the misunderstanding about your mum's visit, which you have now cleared. things have not changed on my side since we spoke, I cannot tell you if I see long term potential in our relationship, but I like you abd I want to continue seeing you"". 

i didn't end it. i think because deep down I believe that it will end on its own, Injust thought about ending it and my mind didn't go naturally in that direction, even like when you know you want somebody, but should end it, it didn't feel this way. i am also worried i didn't end it because I am desperate for love and am hoping he will come around, but I am not sure if it is this, I have certainly felt this way before and i could feel it much more tangibly. then he texted me once to say he got home and wish me a good night and one time in the morning to check in on me. i haven't injtiated any contact and plan not to, and we haven't spoken for two days.

Edit: ‚Äúmisunderstanding about your mum‚Äôs visit, which you have now* cleared‚Äù","What do YOU want out of this?

The tradeoff between online dating  and real life is that people my age are more likely to be married or I  can't filter for the above criteria which are deal breakers for me

My  questions here is regarding other people's experiences. Do you have the  problem of consistently meeting people who are still in the process of  getting over someone and your ceiling to them might just be a rebound or  do you meet people who have done the work and are ready for something  real?

There was a time in my life  where I would have loved to volunteer for that but I don't want to  anymore but that's all I seem to find in the last 1 year especially as  things have settled down after covid and people's lives have stabilized.","Think about it this way, the thing that usually will get a person over their ex is meeting a better match. If you wait around for these people to get over their ex, they‚Äôre going to be doing it by getting over their ex with another person. 

As you age, the dating pool will begin to be more and more represented by people with attachment issues who are single for a reason. Often times the best candidates for a good long-term match are people who are recently out of a long-term relationship. It is a good indicator that they are capable of one.

That said, you need to listen to your gut. You can easily end up a rebound. But a lot of people find out that their rebound relationship is the right one for them.

Eventually started dating and met the first person who I hit it off with almost exactly a year later. We‚Äôve been dating ~7 months now. Exclusive for about 6. 

She expressed interest serious relationship early on. But lately I feel like I‚Äôm just along for the ride. We do planned things together occasionally but it seems mostly like she‚Äôs living her life and I‚Äôm invited. It hasn‚Äôt been all that long so I‚Äôm not expecting a shared calendar here‚Ä¶But her availability for me seems to just be down time. Otherwise it‚Äôs ‚ÄúI‚Äôm doing X if you want to go‚Äù. 

On this front an apparent compatibility issue is showing up with the consistent desire to both ‚Äúgo out‚Äù and stay out (like 2am out). Which is just not for me anymore. I can‚Äôt sleep in and prefer to prioritize my healthy activities. In itself, she can do what she wants to do. But the consistency in choosing that over our time is wearing on me. 

Some examples:

-Mentioned hanging out a particular day last week. Unclear comms until 6pm suddenly she‚Äôs at a sports event she got last minute tickets to. (It was a big event, she‚Äôs a fan, so ok. Stuff comes up)


-We go to a friends BBQ and around 11 I‚Äôm ready to retire. Ask her if she‚Äôs interested in leaving with me, she doesn‚Äôt want to leave, so I go my way. Later find out she was there way late. (Of note, a recently laid off friend is visiting from out of state, so maybe she‚Äôs just entertaining?).  
-At said BBQ we discuss hanging out the following day, but no clarity, mostly in passing. I get notified the following day by her that another friend is in town so they will be going out‚Ä¶I decline.   
It seems this only happens when her long time friends are involved. Whether they have sitters for the day or are in town visiting. 

It‚Äôs my first foray into dating post 20s and I suppose the answer is probably ‚Äútalk about it and see where it goes‚Äù. But I thought I‚Äôd see if anyone saw something I did not.

Also do you have hobbies and interests of your own? If so, does she know about them? Because you could be giving the perception you‚Äôre just along for the ride and relying on her availability.

datingoverthirty,132zmzx,1682784341.0,Looking for others opinions.,"A little background first.  5 years ago I went through a divorce right after a 6 month long major medical issue.  The ex had stayed with me through the time it took for me to get well enough to return to work, but once I was back, she tells me she wants a divorce.  I never really knew why she wanted it, but I was guessing it may have to do with the physical instability that I now have. (which has gotten a lot better since then, but still something I deal with).



This took a long time to recover from.  It has been 5 years since the ex wanted the divorce.   I started to date someone in November of this past year.  This is someone that I have been talking to for about 3 and a half years, but we both know that we wanted to take time and not rush things.  Throughout that time, there were times were each of us wanted more but the other wasn't ready at the time.  Several times we seemed like we were going to be done ever before even trying to actually start a relationship, due to going for weeks without hearing back from her.  Would then get a message apologizing for the delay in reply and an excuse as to why. I wanted to believe what I was told and kept letting myself hold onto the hope because I liked her.

Anyways, we actually started to date this past November.  At first, she seemed all in for it, but now we are back to the week-long or longer delay in replies.  I could understand if my text simply hadn't gone through, but when there have been a few messages with no replies, this keeps telling me she just isn't interested anymore.  Then my mind goes back to the last time I was with her about 2 weeks ago, and it seemed like she very much was interested.

Just don't know what to think.  Know that I should probably let go of any hope for anything more with her, but at the same time feel that my opinions for having someone in my life are pretty low at this point in my life, with being grossly overweight (working to lose but slow going as my stability issues don't quite let me go running or much else where I don't have my concentration on keeping myself standing.  In fact, my major medical issue that I had while with the ex, was due to my weight loss.  Depression that came with the medical issue and then the divorce on top of it, lead to me gaining back 3/4 of what I had lost, but thankfully losing again)  

Anyone gone through something similar and have it eventually work out?  Or should I just stop ignoring the signs?","Despite what you may feel, this woman is not your only option.

Focus on yourself and your goals (weight loss, career, personal, whatever) and move on from this woman.

This sounds exhausting and 3.5 years is far too long to have put yourself through all of it. I doubt this situation is improving your life any, and is probably making it worse. The doubt and uncertainty is awful and you should let go of it and move on."

I wrote it so it stays here. Earlier today my partner came over with his son. What processed was mostly partner sitting on my sofa pretty much crying laughing, and me running around and playing with his son. He just turned 4 a few weeks ago. He‚Äôs such a cool kid. I love spending time with him and he‚Äôs super funny. 

We were running all over the house, jumping on stuff, he kept yelling the floor is lava and we‚Äôd ‚Äòkill‚Äô each other with non existing lasers, my dog became the lava monster we were hiding from, we beat each other up with pillows, I made him ‚Äòfly‚Äô in this weird almost acroyoga style move, he‚Äôd jump off my armchair onto me to ‚Äòget me‚Äô, and then I‚Äôll play dead and yell something silly then resurrect to run after him yelling I‚Äôm going to get him. I don‚Äôt think I laughed so much in ages. He seems to really like coming over to my house since it‚Äôs very much not a child friendly house and I think it lets his imagination run wild (I have cases of real bugs and butterflies behind glass, exposed brickwork everywhere, colourful artwork on every surface and all the walls, a million tropical plants, bugs in resin, and a massive antique buffalo skull on the wall), he‚Äôs interested in everything and asks a ton of questions. I also showed him how to use my little Polaroid camera which he loves. He took a photo of me and one of my dog. I love the photo of me, it came out beautiful. 

I don‚Äôt know what it is, but there‚Äôs something beyond pure about the intensity and vigour with which he plays. He‚Äôs so creative and everything becomes a game, everything is interesting, and I‚Äôm literally seeing the world through his eyes which is magic. I‚Äôve never ever spent time with kids and all of a sudden I get what people talk about when they refer to maternal instincts. I have an actual visceral need to protect this boy no matter what. We‚Äôll play and while he‚Äôs all over the place with intensity and goes super mad, every move I make is calculated beyond a level I ever knew I am capable of. Making sure his head is fine, that he‚Äôs not too close to any edges, that even when things are moving quickly he‚Äôs safe, that I‚Äôm super gentle if I hold him or we play fight, that he‚Äôs ok, it‚Äôs so‚Ä¶ primal. Very strange. 

I love how much this relationship is teaching me about myself and about being a human. This joy I get from seeing my partner‚Äôs son enjoying himself and laughing, when my partner is observing us lovingly is something else. I feel so incredibly lucky. 

Before they left, the kid goes up to the bathroom, partner follows him to help him, the boy yells he doesn‚Äôt need help, I then hear some strange yells, some giggles, more giggles, and ‚Äòwait.. no‚Ä¶ come back‚Äô in partner‚Äôs voice, and the kid runs down the straits butt naked, runs to me, and while giggling starts covering my face with a roll of toilet paper to turn me into a mummy. Partner yells to get back there and that I don‚Äôt want to see him naked, he yells back that it‚Äôs ok, I can‚Äôt see, I‚Äôm a mummy. I‚Äôm laughing so hard. Turns out there was almost pee all over my bathroom, but instead it went on partner‚Äôs hands and the boy‚Äôs clothes, hence the nudity.

He managed to then get him dressed but I don‚Äôt know what exactly about this whole interaction, the ability to be part of a moment that felt really ‚Äòfamily‚Äô like, the fact it felt so trusting, it makes my heart swell with love. This man is amazing, and this kid is so cool. We feel very integrated when we spend time together. 

I never thought I‚Äôd enjoy it so much. As someone who‚Äôs had a very abusive childhood from neglectful and violent parents, which was also the main reason I didn‚Äôt want kinds for the majority of my life, there‚Äôs something incredibly healing in this. 

For the longest time I had internalised that I did something wrong back then, and although I‚Äôm over all of that and have dealt with all the trauma and I am very happy nowadays - seeing just how pure and innocent this boy is, and feeling this internal drive to protect him no matter what, and how fragile that smile of his can be and how much enjoyment I get out of seeing him happy - it‚Äôs like the ultimate validation of ‚ÄòI didn‚Äôt do anything wrong as a kid, I had abusive parents, it wasn‚Äôt my fault, I couldn‚Äôt have been my fault, a was a child‚Äô. I knew those things on an intellectual level, but now I FEEL it. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a way of interacting with kids and not feeling it. They‚Äôre so defenceless, and I feel a duty as an adult to protect this boy. I am sad for my parents they didn‚Äôt have it because it feels so meaningful and purposeful. It‚Äôs weird how now, all these years later, the only negative feelings I have left for the way I was brought up are sadness for my parents that they didn‚Äôt feel what I feel now, this ultimate sense of joy out of seeing someone thrive. Life is weird. I am very happy."

Realizing they aren‚Äôt ready to date; 4. Going on a vacation and not wanting to start something before then; 5. Just general dating burn out.

datingoverthirty,132ty8o,1682777587.0,Profile description preferences,"Hey all.

I was sitting and thinking, for the dating apps that permit it, do you prefer a full, detailed description of the person or would you rather a couple ""bullet points"" when checking out someone's profile? I've been off the apps for a few months, but I recall there being hardly any context in the bio for women (I'm a guy) on the apps, which made it hard to even gauge interest. Do you want to get a taste of the person, or do you want a full, solid bio to work with?","I want as much information crammed in there as possible. But not the boring information you put in your resume. Stuff that describes your personality, ideally in a creative way. This means I prefer bios that aren't using any common formats like the two you mentioned. The more diverse the information and presentation, the better."
datingoverthirty,132qewt,1682767487.0,Was he just playing?,"Hinge, me 34F him 34M. We messaged back and forth for 4 days or so a couple weeks after matching. He started the chat with ‚Äúnetflix and chill?‚Äù And we made plans to meet for a drink and go from there. Plans were rearranged one time then we met a few days later. 
We got a drink and the bartender was rude, trying to close at 830, he rejected the tip because it wasn‚Äôt high enough and my date said the service was bad anyway which was true. We basically agreed to go back to my house when it was clear we couldn‚Äôt stay too long at the bar/ well that‚Äôs when I agreed but it was obviously his plan already.

Conversation flowed a lot better than it has on a date in years, he was asking me questions and the topics we both had something to say about came up naturally. I felt safe with him and he followed me back to my place.
I made us sazeracs while he looked at all the cookbooks I had open. He met my dog and we talked and smoked and he started saying how great our connection was and how rare it is to find that. Our efforts in life, work situations and plans for the future line up perfectly- we are both digital nomads with properties and experience traveling. It was a natural moment and we kissed and cuddled (he tried for more at least twice) and talked until 1am when i made him leave but in a nice way. 

I felt excited and was sure I would see him again, when explaining why I didn‚Äôt want to have sex I explained that it would make me feel too clingy to do that so soon (to which he says he isnt going anywhere) and I shared that I would want to see him no less than 3 times a week if that was the case and I tried to decide on another time we could hang out. The first time I asked he said we could see eachother again the next day, then he sorta tried to stay the night and didn‚Äôt answer when I asked about it again by his car but the connection still felt strong and he said he would message me when he got home safe.

Right after he left I messaged him my number on hinge and referenced a part of our conversation. When I had no messages the next morning it was really emotional for me and distracting to try to figure out why he didn‚Äôt stay connected. I thought he was possibly dead and felt played at the same time. Over the course of the day I put him more and more out of my heart and mind (I did message him 2 more times on the app though)
830 pm he messages me on the app (not the phone number I gave him) says something unexpected came up and he has to go out of town but the connection was phenomenal and he will message me as soon as he gets back into town. 
I did reply but I don‚Äôt have any hope of seeing him again and I‚Äôm looking to understand why I believe men who tell me everything I need to hear. It always feels amazing in the moment and like I was brainwashed when I come out of it. 

Do you think he is just playing?","He told you what he was interested in during the first message and you chose to not listen. You‚Äôre playing yourself, not him."
datingoverthirty,132nx06,1682758980.0,I‚Äôm only used for sex and I can‚Äôt seem to form deeper emotional bonds,"I need your advice on a pattern that I‚Äôm noticing in my dating life that really worries me. For context, I (30F) am looking for a long term partner and I make that clear to people I‚Äôm seeing. 
I‚Äôm going to use the last situation as an example of my problem, which is men (with similar values) seem to refuse to want to get to know me or engage beyond sex. We‚Äôre not talking about no strings attached dating while developing the friendship/companionship aspect, we‚Äôre talking people who wouldn‚Äôt engage at all unless sex was on the table.

This particular guy was very aligned to me in terms of goals and interests (wants to settle down, family oriented, looking for a meaningful relationship, at a good place in life career wise). I loved spending time and talking to him - we would talk for hours about many things, had similar outlooks on life and interests, work in the same field. I found him very interesting and would have definitely been open to getting to know him on a deeper level. Sexual chemistry was off the charts too. 
But he would put up a wall. Most encounters would revolve around smoking a joint, cooking, having sex at his. I couldn‚Äôt text him regularly (every couple days) as he clearly didn‚Äôt appreciate being involved in each others life, I couldn‚Äôt ever sleep over, couldn‚Äôt  flirt or show interest in any way, any proposal of dates and things to do that didn‚Äôt end up with sex would be met with evasive answers. He would often disappear for weeks at a time. No possibility to progress the relationships in any way, I was basically a booty call.

A scenario like the above has happened to me in another two instances fairly recently and this is really eroding my self esteem and self worth.

I feel like there is something defective in me that makes men (even those who are committed to finding a serious relationship) dread the possibility of getting to know me in a setting that isn‚Äôt their bedroom. 

Please note that I‚Äôm not expecting everyone to fall in love with me - but I‚Äôm trying hard to screen for people who are aligned with what I want, and I seem to be only good for sex. I find it really hard to get the other party to form a deeper emotional connection and see any value in me as an individual beyond my genitalia. 
I thought there was a chance with this guy because I definitely felt a spark beyond our physical chemistry but I clearly misread the situation.
I don‚Äôt tend to sleep on the first dates (I hate women being judged for this but I know it‚Äôs a question that will likely get asked) and I consider myself quite pleasant to be around, easy to talk to. I‚Äôve got interests and hobbies, a solid circle of friends, I‚Äôm ambitious and doing well in life. I‚Äôm not the most extroverted person and it can take a while to warm up but I‚Äôm not socially awkward either. 
I have no idea what I‚Äôm doing wrong and how to solve this.. but like I said, it is impacting my my mental health. Any feedback appreciated.","stop putting energy into people who aren‚Äôt giving you the same level of attention/energy etc as you. 

don‚Äôt hope people will change or come around. observe their behaviour, accept it as their truth, and use that to enforce your boundaries about who you allow access to you.

boundaries stop this cycle real quick."
datingoverthirty,132hujv,1682738216.0,Is it common to maintain friendships with people you met on the app and dated for a few months?,"The guy I'm currently dating has a lot of women friends, and it seems like a fair number of them are exes, or people he dated casually on the apps. Basically, since a month after I met him, he's told me that he's told these ex partners about me, and he's often wanted to introduce me to them/saying they 'want to meet me."" I haven't asked who ended things, and when I've asked why they didn't work out I've just gotten a vague answer.

Anyway, I find this odd as I really don't maintain friendships with people I dated casually or otherwise. The last time I tried that, the guy went MIA- even though we'd been platonic for years and there weren't any romantic feelings on my end certainly. I then heard he'd gotten married. And the lack of communication about that definitely weirded me out.

Anyway I'm just wondering if this is typical, and maybe I'm an outlier.. I can't decide if it's a good thing or a red flag that he's maintained contact with so many people. He also had a FWB that he ended when he met me. When we started dating he said I love you fairly early and has moved pretty fast in my book as far as wanting to be exclusive and calling me his gf etc. so- I have some doubts.","There are plenty of people who remain friends with exes or people they casually dated. Plenty who don‚Äôt. There‚Äôs no ‚Äúnormal‚Äù or typical, especially in an era where people are meeting new dates practically every week ‚Äî people do what they‚Äôre comfortable with.

Personally, if I go on a few dates with someone and we realize we‚Äôd actually make great friends, I don‚Äôt see the point in just trashing the friendship altogether ‚Äî it‚Äôs not like they‚Äôre forever labeled as ‚Äúromantic interest only‚Äù or something.

But if it makes you uncomfortable, I‚Äôd honestly say don‚Äôt even bother with this relationship. This is a huge point of incompatibility that rarely works itself out in a positive manner. Folks who are uncomfortable or insecure about their partner being friends with exes generally always will be."
datingoverthirty,132e1b2,1682726937.0,How often do you ACTUALLY go on horrible dates?,"The title doesn't say much in what I'm trying to get at here but this is directed towards FIRST DATES ONLY. I'm a 35M and have been on a LOT of first dates in my life. I personally have only been on one bad date that I can think of right off the bat. It was only bad because she catfished me, but if it werent for that, the date went fine. If I'm not physically attracted to a woman, everything else doesn't matter and at the very least, I'd be friends with her. Which is why I will never understand catfishers... 

So realistically, how often do you *really* go on ""bad"" dates? Like, what is a bad date for you? I'm actually fantastic at first impressions and first dates and up to now, have never been turned down for a second or third date however, I'm just curious what a bad date is for you and how often does this tend to happen? 

What makes a date bad? what makes you not want to see them again?","I‚Äôve been on one bad first date and it was more awkward than bad. A friend invited me out to a show, I got there and he was there with two women I didn‚Äôt know: one he introduced as his new girlfriend that I hadn‚Äôt yet met, and she introduced me to her friend she brought along. I guess they were planning a double date/blind date type thing but never bothered telling me beforehand. 

This other woman immediately starts asking me interview style questions, but she‚Äôd also clearly been briefed on my interests and hobbies. Only none of it was accurate. She‚Äôd been told I‚Äôm in a band, I‚Äôm a painter, and a writer! The closest to any of that I could come up with was I played piano in elementary school, I paint warhammer 40k minis, and I write annual reports at work. 

Anytime I tried to say I wasn‚Äôt any of those things my buddy‚Äôs gf would give me an angry look and say ‚Äúyes you do you‚Äôre just being modest.‚Äù Like, even if I did go along with these ridiculous lies about me if the two of us hit it off she would‚Äôve eventually found out!"
datingoverthirty,13264cv,1682707319.0,Expectations,"I put this in the daily thread, but am also searching for feedback from others‚Äô experiences:

The guy I‚Äôm seeing last night asked that we talk about expectations, which of course had me asking questions to myself. Although I had asked after he had mentioned that he would talk to me in a couple days after I got home from a work trip, I had asked whether that was him setting a boundary. Luckily we had a quick phone call about our days. He had explained what he is having stress with right now, and we figured out that he doesn‚Äôt really like texting during the week(makes sense - he told me this before our hiatus, and we had been texting frequently during our ‚Äúregroup.‚Äù So now I know his need to have personal time with out convos via text and instead with calls about our days. Honestly I‚Äôm glad he could communicate this and it feels like a less codependent relationship. He also confirmed he wasn‚Äôt interested jn seeing other people.

Pre-hiatus he never really asked to call about his day, or ask to discuss what we are expecting out of this. Is this a good turn in the right direction? My initial reaction was that he thinks I‚Äôm looking for something serious and he wants casual, but I know that‚Äôs black/white, future forecasting thinking. And yes, I know we need to actually discuss, and I guess I‚Äôm trying to prep myself.

Update: things must be going in a good direction. He just called to ask how my flight was, and asked if I wanted to do a quick overnight trip (including hiking, dinner, etc), which we hadn‚Äôt done before. And he‚Äôs referred to this place as his ‚Äúhappy place,‚Äù so I‚Äôm going to be confident that this is a positive thing and relax, and get out of my head! Go with the flow.",">Is this a good turn in the right direction? 

Seems like it, yeah, he's been communicating, while on his terms, his expectations but at the same time including you into them, into his life. Unless you feel he is forcing it but it doesn't sound like he is

> I know we need to actually discuss, and I guess I‚Äôm trying to prep myself.

datingoverthirty,13277h4,1682709781.0,Is this weird?,"I matched with a guy on a dating app, and we went out on our first date a few days. Although we met, he hasn‚Äôt asked me for my number, but continues to message me through the app. What makes things even more interesting is that he asked me out on a second date, but still hasn‚Äôt supplied his number. I feel confused about this. What are your thoughts about this? (I feel confused about why he would opt to continue messaging me though the app vs directly on the phone). 

Ps. His profile says he‚Äôs looking for a relationship.

Any advice?","Fretting over the hidden meaning of these little things that could simply be up to personal preference or his desire to not make you uncomfortable will get you nowhere because if 50 people respond to your post, you'll get 50 different answers on how people handle getting or giving phone numbers.

Sometimes I keep it in the app until after a couple dates. Sometimes I give them my phone number before the first date. Sometimes I ask for theirs. It depends on the situation and what I ate for lunch that day.

If you want to move to text, give him your number or ask for his. Don't let yourself overanalyze this single minor and possibly meaningless thing. Save your mental energy for observing other, much more significant qualities about how he treats you and treats the connection."
datingoverthirty,1321zs6,1682701142.0,Would you prefer a man show obvious interest early on or is that a turnoff for you?,"I'm not a ""love bomber"" by any means but, I am very loving and affectionate both through words, gestures and actions and usually fairly on if I really like the woman. 

I'm the type who in the past, had a tendency to ""hold back"" showing too much interest with women early on and, many times it didn't end up working out for one reason or another. My guess is that she either felt that I wasn't interested or was moving too slowly. 

So, what I tend to do these days is show my feelings and intentions quite early on, and in fairly obvious ways. Nothing clingy or needy or things like that. Not saying ""i love you"" after a week knowing someone. Nothing crazy like that lol. But more along the lines of expressing OBVIOUS interest. To me, I'd prefer to lay my feelings out on the table early on so that if she isn't feeling the same, she can bounce, rather than spending weeks on end ""figuring things out"" only for it not to work out. If that makes any sense at all lol.

Would you prefer a man show interest early on or him be more ""reserved"" about his feelings/intentions?",I strongly prefer when a man shows obvious interest and ACTS on it if it‚Äôs mutual. I don‚Äôt want to have to guess how someone feels about me; acting aloof is for high schoolers and we‚Äôre all years out of high school.

datingoverthirty,131atxs,1682637573.0,Do you start giving your all to a relationship right off the bat? Or when you make it official? Or just naturally as the relationship grows?,"I think I‚Äôve had a major problem with this. I hold back a TON until I know that we want to try for a relationship, so I don‚Äôt ever really show them how caring and awesome I am in the dating phase. Well I do, just not to the degree I WANT to show them.

For some reason I‚Äôve always felt the dating stage should be free flowing and fun with not many expectations and then once we decide to become boyfriend and girlfriend I can take things more seriously and really show how great of a partner I can be.

Is this a problem or the wrong mindset?

For example I dated one girl last year who I dated for about 3 months and I ended up asking her out to where she said she wanted to take it slow and needs more for a relationship. I after that I felt like I couldn‚Äôt give much and just held back so much and it turned into a situationship that ended terribly because she thought I just didn‚Äôt care.","I feel like this is like saying during an internship you only are willing to give 70% effort and only in the event the job offers you a permanent position you finally give your true 100%. Probably not the best way to compete if you only give 70% when others are willing to show up hitting 100% at the trial phase.

Also what does ""giving your all"" mean to you? Showing up on time, planning fun dates, cooking for them, being vulnerable? I think you can be casual and fun but also be giving 100%."
datingoverthirty,131efuz,1682647158.0,Ex is angrily trying to exclude me from a community he brought me into. Not sure if I deserve it.," I (30F) was with my ex 'Sid' (35M) for 5 years. 

TL;DR - ex and I met and he got me involved in a community based on an activity we both love. We had a complex break up, he fell in love with me after it ended, I gave him hope to be together again for a short time and dashed the hope, he is trying to separate me from the community out of his anger now.

The relationship was great on the surface (for me). I was happy and committed and loved him deeply. We‚Äôre into the same activity and he‚Äôs a big part of the community around this activity as an organizer and performer, so I met and made many friends through him and that community has become a big part of my life.

Throughout Sid struggled with his mental health which affected our relationship more than both of us realized. In May '21, Sid decided he wanted to be poly and after some back and forth he cheated on me so we broke up. 

It was rough for me - he basically made it sound like he had never really loved me passionately which really broke me. While recovering I moved cities, got a great job, re-established my friend circle, and worked hard at moving on. After a few months I was basically thriving. Like I was released from a cage, I was living my best life. 

Sid on the other hand dated the girl he cheated on me with for a couple of months and she turned out to be awful, dumped him after a few months and he was a wreck.

At this point Sid and I also reconnected and he... fell in love with me. For real this time. For the first time. Like he had never been in all the years we were together. 

It was really shocking and difficult to process being around the version of Sid that actually loved me, unlike the person I loved for 5yrs.. hard to explain how that feels. We hooked up a couple times (for me it felt like just reconnecting and being intimate with a best friend but for him it really went deeper than I realized). I was dating others at the time and Sid and I experimented with being in a non-monogamous relationship but it didn't quite work because he was in it deeper than I. 

I entered and exited various situationships over the next year and a half. Sid and I went back and forth between no contact and then resuming contact, like platonic best friends and not, throughout. He was still deeply in love with me and was not able to move past his feelings - despite his other poly relationships. I enjoyed and wanted his friendship and support so I didn't cut him off. I suppose I selfishly I wanted his companionship even though I wasn't looking for a deeper relationship. 

FF to today - I have met someone ('Mik') I'm now exclusively with but initially he expressed preferring non-monogamy. At first I tried dating other people but had a hard time not comparing new guys to Mik. Our connection was/is amazing. Felt like non-monogamy wasn't really possible for me. Sid and I stayed in touch during this time and I had the thought that perhaps if I was to be in an ENM partnership with Mik, Sid is probably another person I could explore dating at the same time. Because I don't compare them, I already love Sid, and it would feel comfortable. I told him this and he was enthusiastic about trying that again. 

I spent the next week thinking harder about things with Sid and talking to my therapist and realised it was actually a bad idea and since our feelings are so imbalanced it wouldn't be right of me to bring Sid into this experiment of mine. So I called things off with Sid and decided to just focus on Mik regardless of the ENM stuff.

Sid was.. very upset. He sent me a long angry text message calling me manipulative and awful and told me to stay away from the events he participated in and that this was NC for real. Since then I have been excluded from a few events and unable to share in that activity with my friends as he didn‚Äôt want me there. Most recently was an event the same weekend as his birthday, so I stayed away so he could enjoy his birthday.

But it feels unfair to me. I know my actions were hurtful, but I was being true to my feelings and changed my mind before we got in too deep. I don‚Äôt want to be excluded from this community and my friends because of it. He‚Äôs especially well known and well loved and participates in everything.

About half the men at the event I went to looked like they hadn't showered or changed clothes in a couple of days. Most of the women looked like they had planned out their date night outfits way ahead of time lol. 

Keep the conversation natural. Have a list of questions memorized, but don't use them unless you need them to avoid awkward silences. 

If you know someone's not a match, still use the opportunity to practice your lines and settle down if you're nervous.

datingoverthirty,1310yvd,1682619488.0,Struggling with rejection,"I get a lot of matches on dating apps and get asked out in person too. But I've been rejected a lot when it comes to actually being in a relationship and I don't know why either. They say I'm smart, fun, pretty, and so on, but even though they like me, they don't want a relationship. I don't have any obvious dealbreakers, so it would be something more subtle. 

Maybe I'm consistently going out with guys who are ""out of my league"", but how do I figure out if a guy is in my league or not, other than spending countless hours going on dates until they turn me down? Doing it this way of getting my hopes up by asking me out then the rejection later is taking a toll on me. Any advice welcome.","What if nothing has gone wrong here? What if you just haven't met the right person? 

You're looking at this from the perspective of what you've done wrong and why you aren't good enough, when you could choose to see it as you haven't met anyone compatible enough for the relationship you want to create. There is no such thing as leagues. There is compatible, and there is not compatible. 

You get to choose how you view rejection. You could see it as something to be afraid of or something to welcome. Dating is about finding someone who is compatible with you, your values, and your life and relationship goals. Not everyone is going to fit that role, so rejection literally has to happen, from both sides. 

It's not a matter of you not being good enough; it's a matter of not being a good fit for a genuine, healthy, and lasting relationship. It doesn't have to be a problem. It's just making space in your life for your person."

datingoverthirty,12yr4kk,1682446124.0,Girlfriend‚Äôs dog is a problem,"Hey DOT. Been dating my girlfriend for a year. We have been together with the intent to move towards a long term future, and we don‚Äôt live together. She has a 100+ pound dog who has become an issue for me. Frankly, he‚Äôs not trained well and has his freedom of the house. There have been instances of my girlfriend and I being in bed with him and him getting aggressive with me- growling, lunging. Seems like his beef with me is pretty much done as he has figured out he‚Äôs not the boss. 

Here‚Äôs the problem‚Ä¶.we both have one daughter each, hers 4 and mine 7. We introduced them 7 or 8 months ago. The dog gets real anxious when mine is around -at her heels, reacts to her doing something as simple as getting up and moving to a different room. He will take off after her barking, lunge and get in her face. It‚Äôs never felt like his intent is to attack, but it‚Äôs always kept me on edge. Well, two weekends ago we were all together and my patience ran out with it. He‚Äôs not becoming any less interested in this behavior. I spoke with my daughter regarding her feelings about the animal and she expressed being afraid of him and was upset that she didn‚Äôt know how to handle him. I don‚Äôt blame her and back her 100 percent. For more context, gf said the dog got snippy with her when she and HER daughter were playing recently. My fear is he will do the same with my daughter in that scenario and escalate to a bite. I heard one of gf‚Äôs friends say she won‚Äôt let her child around the animal one time, which is validating to me.

I had a real honest conversation with my gf last weekend laying a boundary that I don‚Äôt feel safe with the dog around my daughter anymore and don‚Äôt want them sharing the same space at this time.  Neither I nor my daughter feel safe. She said she will put him up when my daughter is around. I let her know I‚Äôm not opposed to trying again in the future, but there would need to be a behavior change with him. She replied something along the lines(I don‚Äôt remember her exact words) that she wasn‚Äôt sure how that would happen. I told her I understand it feels like a wedge and a step in the wrong direction, but my job number one as dad is to protect my daughter. She agreed I‚Äôm not being unreasonable, but said it sucks. I‚Äôve done my best to accept the animal as an extension of her, as her family, but I‚Äôm not chancing him with my daughter. She‚Äôs been pretty quiet since.

So, here‚Äôs where I‚Äôm at. I feel like keeping the dog put away is a bandaid. It‚Äôs short term. I don‚Äôt see us cohabitating with him in the picture with that behavior. I don‚Äôt want to sweep this under the rug. I want it addressed if a future is in the cards for us. I want to be reasonable, but also not drag out what could ultimately be a dealbreaker. Any tips on where to go from here and how soon?

Edit: Thank you all for the insight and validation. I feel good in taking my next step to communicate training/behaviorist is a must moving forward. I‚Äôve also been given some kind ways to approach that conversation without it coming off as an ultimatum, which is also appreciated. It‚Äôs also noted I need to take note of how serious she takes this concern and conversation in addition to an untrained dog maybe being an indicator of other concerns.

Update: I‚Äôve received a lot of comments from folks who have interacted with dogs with this profile, both build and demeanor. Reflecting all day, digesting comments and listening to my gut makes me feel like I won‚Äôt ever be able to trust this animal‚Ä¶even after it had some behavior changes. Ugh.

Update 2: I‚Äôve decided my daughter will never be around the animal again. It‚Äôs a danger, a liability, and my gut says no.  I don‚Äôt feel I‚Äôll be able to trust the animal, even if the effort were put in to address the behavior. Not sure how the relationship will shake out as a result, but I can accept that better than I can a compromise to my daughter‚Äôs safety. It sure is a sore spot right now. I appreciate all the contributions and perspectives.","Your concerns are valid.

It sounds like you're right to keep your child away from the dog. I agree, you should not cohabitate given the current circumstances.

Has she tried working with a reputable dog trainer? I would give that a shot and ask them for an honest assessment of whether it is safe for the dog to be around children."

datingoverthirty,12xg4w4,1682343532.0,Was I in the wrong for ending things after a month of knowing each other?,"Hey DOT,

I feel like I may have overreacted and ended things with someone potentially great. I would be open to hearing your views to learn from my experience. 

I, 33M, matched with a 31F on Hinge a month ago. 
We live about an hour away from each other, and we matched at the worse time. She was picking up overtime from work and vacationing out of the country for a week. Our first date was set four weeks after matching. 

Within four days after matching, we are talking on the phone, and she trauma-dumps on me about her surviving a DV moment from the first time she met her stepfather at age 13. I tried reassuring her by saying ‚ÄúWhat happened in your past does not define you now. And it will not change how I see you.‚Äù A classic case of good intentions but poor delivery. She took it personally by saying ‚Äú I did not think being a survivor would have anyone think of her differently‚Äù (wasn‚Äôt my intention to cause this) we made up the day after I apologized the next morning. 


While she was on vacation, she kept mentioning how her body type is ‚Äúthick‚Äù and would ask me several times if that was okay. She was triggered when I mentioned she looks beautiful and I could not understand where her self-esteem was coming from. 
Once again, good intentions but poor ass delivery. Apparently, a previous person said she did not look like her photos and he felt deceived; that left a mark on her. 


Two weeks ago, we began talking about sexual compatibility and history. We agreed that we should get an STD test because we both have not had one after our previous partners. Two days after that conversation, I decide to get one because it was my day off, but she took it as if I am rushing things. Also, she was questioning my intentions if I was only looking to have sex.  She had a valid point, but I reminded her that I long paused my Hinge account (second week knowing her) because I wanted to focus on her. 

Last week, she asked about my emotional abuse history with my ex, and I began sharing them openly. She took it as why am I mentioning it for the third time within two weeks, and she questioned if I was over my ex. During this time, she was open to talking about her past relationships and how her first partner in high school OD passed away. 

Last week, I was bringing up sexual comments and she asked for me to tone it down out of nowhere. I understood that boundary; however, it confused me because she was mentioning satisfying herself with the thought of me earlier that day while I was at work. My response to her boundary was not the best‚Ä¶I said, ‚ÄúMaybe we should talk less as we have not met in person and how many boundaries are being set.‚Äù 

Let‚Äôs end this with what happened this weekend. Originally, we had a date set for Sunday, but that was canceled because she got food poisoning during the week and had to switch days at work so she can have the following day to recover. She could not work Saturday because that was her father‚Äôs birthday dinner. 

We agreed to meet Tuesday. On Saturday, she mentions how upset I will be if she picks up a shift on Tuesday so she can help at work and give us more time for us to process our setbacks. 

I told her this whole situation does not make sense. She was telling me how I bring out the best in her; mentioning me to her father at his birthday dinner; and telling her coworkers I could be the one.

It did not make sense to me to have that in her mind and want to prioritize work than meet me for the first time on a date. 

I approached her on the phone and said this does not seem right, and it is best that we end things based on patterns i am seeing. Setbacks after setbacks that seem to get worse before meeting someone. 

Her reply was I am thinking ‚Äúirrational‚Äù and ‚Äúwhere all this stuff is coming from.‚Äù Began saying how much I bring the best out of her and how much potential we have.

I went through and said it is over. 

So DOT, be honest with me. What can I do to be understanding or better? 

Or did I dodge a bullet?","You hadn‚Äôt even met her? She‚Äôs prepping you for not looking like her pictures and trauma dumping and you guys already got into an argument requiring you to make up?

Again, this is BEFORE you even got to verify she looks even remotely like her pictures or appears how she is. If I had to guess, based upon the constant rescheduling of dates and comments about her appearance. She doesn‚Äôt look like her pictures, knows it, is insecure about it, and won‚Äôt meet up because of that. 

Sounds like she has a lot of issues she needs to work out before dating and is being taken out on you. I think it was the best to end it."
datingoverthirty,12xb52v,1682332417.0,"Too fast too soon? AFAB 36, Guy 38 sleep overs and exclusivity after 2 dates?","&#x200B;

TLDR at the bottom.

I‚Äôm AFAB non-binary 36 and guy i‚Äôm dating is 37.

I met a guy just over a week a go and had two dates and two video calls inbetween.

We get on amazingly well, like right from the jump. Our first date was 5hrs long (by choice haha). We‚Äôre both on the same page re LTR/Marriage and he‚Äôs ready to settle down. He said these were the best dates he had in years and I feel the same.

My concern is if things are moving too fast? I have already communicated to him that I want to take things slow which he‚Äôs supportive of, which actually just means a normal pace for me (seeing each other once a week, no sleepovers for 6-8 weeks as that tends to be when I feel comfortable).

He has already invited me on friends trips away (we‚Äôre in the England and the trips are to LDN and Wales and are later in the year).

A few things feel a bit fast for me and I‚Äôll mention them below:

\-Last week he offered to meet me for a coffee whilst a friend of mine was in town visiting, I wasn‚Äôt ready for a friend to meet a guy I‚Äôd know 1 week.

\-He offered a sleep over at his this wkend (which would be wk 2 of knowing each other and he said, sleep overs don‚Äôt have to mean sex if we don‚Äôt want them to)

\-He said on our second date he‚Äôs ready to call it and be exclusive

\-He mentioned he got me a small bday gift (my bday was in feb but my friend visiting bought down my gifts from then which is how he knew)

So far his actions match his words and he seems like a really nice guy who is keen. He is direct and clear with his communication with me which is great.

I am autistic so am not always great at recognising my emotions or the intentions of others, and I have been in 1 abusive relationship before, so I am hyper aware/vigilent when dating and I‚Äôm wondering is this my trauma response or am I right to trust my gut that this is fast (I‚Äôm also not at all saying this guy is predatory, he hasn‚Äôt shown me anything to indicate that he is)?

I think I‚Äôm pretty good at communicating my needs so I will have another conversation with this person this coming weekend. I‚Äôd like to give him the benefit of the doubt and just assume he‚Äôs super keen and yet, I have vulnerabilities about me that mean I often have to be more aware of things than I‚Äôd like.

&#x200B;

I will also add, I am in therapy so I am working my way through my stuff. I do have friends I can ask but they are also neurodiverse or have skewed lenses like I do, I know strangers on the internet is not a fool proof way of getting a second pair of eyes etc.

&#x200B;

**TLDR:** Is my guy just keen or moving too fast in a problematic way? Ready to be exclusive/couple after 2 dates, wants to invite me on friendgroup holidays and offering sleep overs after knowing each other less than 10 days. I am on the spectrum & am a survivor of DV, so struggle with what's normal.

&#x200B;

Edit: Thank you kind strangers, I really appreciate all of your opinions and suggestions here. I did want to add I was pretty blunt/straightforward in communicating my boundaries re wanting to take things slowly and what that means. I will tread carefully, communicate my boundaries again and observe him.  I do hope they prove me wrong and it's just someone whose keen and ready etc.","This all seems too much too soon. Gifts, trips, jumping straight into a exclusive relationship and sleep overs after only 2 dates. Red flags of love bombing. Your intuition is correct."
datingoverthirty,12x387r,1682310883.0,How to keep your morale up after several unsuccessful attempts to solidify a relationship?,"Hey everyone,

So, I guess here has been in the same situation as me, since we're all in our 30s and single. Being this age and still dating means that perhaps you've been by several heartbreaks, some bigger than others, some provoked by you, some by your ex-partner... at the end it all resulted in you being single at this age.

So, my question is, how do you keep your hopes up?

Right now I'm about to just give up entirely from dating because holy fuck, it's taking a toll on me, but then again... I've been alone for so long now and I kinda crave that romantic partnership with someone.

Hooooow? just how?!

Since I moved here to Canada (2019) I've been very successful in the hookup scene but I just can't get something long-term. I don't know if it's the vibes I'm giving, if I'm just not getting the culture or if I'm choosing wrong who to put my eyes on when it comes to more serious dating (or all of the above, why not?) and its just breaking me because its almost the same story over and over again: we have a blast at the beginning, we do several dates, have sex, be vulnerable with them, keep dating for a bit after and then BAM!: ""you deserve someone better"", ""I have to sort this by myself, I don't want you to carry my burdens"", ""I have to sort this out, I thought I was ready but I'm not"" and all those euphemisms for ""you're kinda cool and all but not that into you"" which I mean, totally fair, I get it and I appreciate the sugar-coating (although, I think these is exactly what nice guys were told and believed) (I don't believe them, I'm aware is just a nice way of rejecting)  but man, is wearing me down and have no real feedback to improve on. So after this, healing comes, keep doing my thing and then I put myself out there in bars, classes, the gym and the apps... and... well, you know the rest.

So, again, how to keep going? How do you keep your morale up and keep looking for your person?",I now use online dating as a form of self harm

I don‚Äôt know whether he was really enjoying our time or what‚Ä¶
I sweat a lot and the strong stuff is usually too irritating. So sweating and stinking is something I‚Äôm self conscious about. I shower before dates, my clothes are clean, but won‚Äôt the sweat floodgates are opened, it over ü•πü•∫ So I need honest answers. If you were doing something active with your date and that started to sweat and smell bad, would that be a turn off? What about visible sweat stains? I don‚Äôt get why restaurant dates get so much flack. I love a good climate controlled environment. 

Now on the inappropriate questions. I had previously told the guy I met OLD what area I live in. We meet up at a coffee shop and during the convo he asks again and I tell him the neighborhood, but he asks again and I say a random street in my neighborhood. He seemed to want clarification? Does he really think I‚Äôm going to give in my address or even the cross streets? If we met in a public place, clearly I don‚Äôt want to meet in private. Then we‚Äôre talking about my work and I mentioned the software I use and that I freelance in addition to my 9-5. Why did he ask me how much I made on my last freelance gig? For those that are from non-US/western cultures, is that common to ask? What about rent/mortgage questions? Now I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs appropriate, but is this normal for people to feel so comfortable and bold to asks these things? 

I clearly need to get better at boundaries, because some responses I was about to be vague to protect my privacy and others not so much. I‚Äôve never in my life have asked a stranger on a date how much they make.

I honestly just want to say ‚Äòthat‚Äôs none of your business‚Äô or ‚Äòthat‚Äôs no appropriate‚Äô, but is there a playful way to reframe my responses? Should I just be writing these guys off? Because I‚Äôll do that, but it just seems to happen too much. Do they think I‚Äôm rich and are trying to find out how much I make? I‚Äôm not rich at all. Like, what‚Äôs going on DatingOverThirty?","For the activity thing, sweating and a little bit of BO when it was obvious the person was not smelling before and we are both in a strenuous activity (like hiking or really long walk or jog) seems like something weird to be turned off by. I know I personally wouldn't, but am also self conscious about the same thing the other way around (as a guy). I could see that maybe long term people might be sensitive to certain body odors and that someone who may be a bit more smelly than normal might be a turnoff to some. It's so far down my list of things to care about though personally.  


As for the inappropriate questions, if someone has ignored your polite refusal or redirection away from such directed questions, it seems like a red flag to me. I would think it would be from the other person's point of view as well: if they aren't getting the hint, or they think the question is so important and you aren't up front with it, they should take that as their cue to bow out. I don't think it's a problem for them though, and seems to be more about not knowing boundaries. Location and finances on the first date or two seems like a no-go unless volunteered by one party during the date (but doesn't necessarily have to be reciprocated).  


""I'm not comfortable discussing such things so early in our acquaintance"" should be sufficient, and if it isn't, you should probably leave."
datingoverthirty,12wxbct,1682298141.0,Asking someone out that you already see routinely,"Hello DOT,

I'd (32M) like some advice as to the most ""suave"" way of handling asking out a prospect or at least communicating my interest to her (32F) directly or indirectly.

I met this girl through a hobby of mine so I see her at least once a week in a group setting. We also text from time to time. I don't know if I want to directly ask her out because if it's not reciprocated, I don't really want it to result in general awkwardness as long as we both continue in this hobby.

My approach right now has just been trying to get her to hang out outside of class together just her and I without putting the label of date on it. I feel like calling anything a date just adds unnecessary pressure when it can just be us hanging out and getting to know each other. She has shown interest in this and even suggested something for us to do. We saw each other Friday night in a social setting and she opened up to me about something personal and even seemed to flirt with me a bit.

We are planning to do something 1:1 and have a time and place nailed down for it in about a week.

What's the right play here? There's obviously some merit in being direct and bold but I'm not so sure it's the right move at least yet. I got so used to the more direct approach with OLD and feel a little out of practice in the IRL realm.

&#x200B;

Edit: I am expecting some will read this and be like (""dude, sounds like you already asked her out""). I guess my question here is how obvious do I make my intentions/ how transparent should I be with my interest in her.","Ye old adage of nothing ventured, nothing gained?

You don't get the benefit of confidently showing interest with the protection of pretending that you're not interested in case it's not reciprocated.

Also, if you choose to 'lack transparency' and get friendzoned please don't complain about how you feel like you've wasted time befriending this girl only for your interest to not be reciprocated. If anyone gets to complain in that scenario, it's her for genuinely thinking she was making a friend without realising said friend had ulterior motives the entire time."

At one point we were sitting down and she starts sharing a very personal story to her about how she plans to put her notice in at her company this week. It was clearly a very emotional story to her, and I actually felt a lot closer to her because it felt like she was opening up to me.

Fast forward about an hour later, we are sitting in my car just chatting. At one point we locked eyes and smiled. I told her that I wanted to kiss her, but she just smiled and said, ""Let's take things slow"" :(

While things did get a little awkward (I had no idea what to say next) as we drifted back into life talk, there was one moment on the drive back to her building worth mentioning. I was about to pull up to her gate, but she suddenly told me to drive down the block instead because she wanted to show me the gardening on a house she liked. So she had the opportunity to get out of the car, but instead she opted to extend the date a few minutes, which I don't feel like she would have done if she was 100% turned off.

When I did drop her off, she told me, ""Let's chat later this week."" I didn't try to plan anything specific since I still was a little unsure on how to proceed, so she just hugged me and left.

In hindsight, I feel like I messed up trying to kiss her today. While she was obviously opening up to me about something personal, I feel like I listened to the emotional side of my brain (""this means she's into me"") as opposed to the logical (""I think she likes me, but she clearly has a stressful week ahead of her when she puts in her notice"").  It's a lot easier for me to see that now that I've processed everything.

Maybe I am just friend zoned though because if she really liked me as much as I thought she did, then why would she reject my kiss? I like her, but I have no idea where I stand or what to do next.  Can I recover from this? Has anyone (guy or girl) had a similar experience?

PS - Yes, this is the same ""[bad texter](https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/12rt6hn/is_bad_texter_really_an_excuse/)"" from this post last week. Turns out she has a work phone that she mostly uses during the week instead of her personal cell. She also self-professed to being ""the worst texter in the world"" (no, I did not call her out on this) but she was very receptive after I called her and we talked for over an hour. Lucky me!","Nah that sounds promising. As others have said, until you feel flakeyness in texting or such, amd she agrees on more dates, take it all as positives"

So, long story short: We have been on two dates since I made that first post. 

Our originally planned date was cancelled due to an unforeseen emergency on my end, so we rescheduled for last week. We went out for dinner, then a walk, and ended making out in his car. Last night we had dinner at his place. He cooked and made breakfast in the morning too. He was very sweet and accommodating and had no expectations. 

I texted him saying I want to keep seeing him, but non-exclusively, and he has agreed to it. I decided this because on our first date, he disclosed what is usually a dealbreaker for me. I‚Äôm not going to discuss it here. It‚Äôs simply a major life incompatibility, and in addition, the only reason we even met is because of his work. He‚Äôs in a specialized field and has to follow whatever opportunity comes, so he could leave anytime. With those two factors, I‚Äôm not willing to commit to him exclusively. One of the things I seek in a long-term partner is intent to stay in our shared location. I‚Äôm going to keep looking for that while enjoying what this match brings. And as a result of this connection, I am going to stay open-minded in terms of the initial effort I see on the app.",Honestly it sounds like you're wasting your own time at this point if he has a major deal breaker for you. I think you're overanalyzing it.

datingoverthirty,12vjduo,1682197743.0,How much sexual incompatibility is a deal breaker?,"I (30F) am dating an interesting person (33M). We have only been seeing each other for a little over a month, and it‚Äôs been good so far.

However, I‚Äôm extremely sexual and he isn‚Äôt. Around 30% of the time we hang out doesn‚Äôt end in sex because he‚Äôs not in the mood. He said that because of depression and mood swings there are times when he isn‚Äôt emotionally available (and thus can‚Äôt get in the mood?). Unfortunately I‚Äôm always in the mood for sex, so I have to deal with some form of rejection during those times.

I‚Äôm struggling to identify if this is a deal breaker. We have good sex during the 70%, although pretty vanilla for now. I also recognize that I derive some self-worth from how men perceive me sexually, and this seeming lack of interest from him has affected my confidence. I‚Äôve told him this and he assures me it‚Äôs on him (to clarify: the lack of interest in sex is due to his feelings and is not because of me/my looks/whatever), and that he does find me attractive.

On nights that he isn‚Äôt into it, he has offered to help me out, or watch me, even though he doesn‚Äôt want sex for himself. I have declined because it feels ‚Äúobligatory‚Äù and I think it would turn me off. 

I used to think that *any* sexual incompatibility is a deal breaker. But I‚Äôm also aware that there is a limited number of men who are interested in me, who I‚Äôm interested in, and whose personality and general outlook matches mine ‚Äî outside of this sex issue, of course.

My best guess is to let this relationship run its course for a little more time, but I doubt the situation from both our sides is going to change. What do you think? What kinds of sexual incompatibility would be deal breakers for you?","So it seems like there‚Äôs *more* than *just* sexual incompatibility going on here. 

It also has to do with how you‚Äôre perceiving the incompatibility as ‚Äúrejection.‚Äù

You mention needing to deal with ‚Äúsome form of rejection‚Äù when you‚Äôre in the mood and he‚Äôs not. 

Rejection is a broad term and I can understand why him saying ‚Äúno‚Äù in whatever way *feels* like rejection. But, him not being in the mood is not a personal reflection on you. It‚Äôs not him saying he doesn‚Äôt accept you. It‚Äôs not him saying he doesn‚Äôt like you. It‚Äôs not him saying he‚Äôs not attracted to you. It‚Äôs him saying his body doesn‚Äôt necessarily have the same physical response yours does when he‚Äôs interested in someone. 

I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs worth doing some internal exploring. You mention deriving some self-worth from how men perceive you sexually. So is it you‚Äôre *really* honestly, just genuinely always in the mood for sex? Or, is some of your desire for sex coming from wanting validation that someone finds you sexually attractive?

The answer could absolutely be that you‚Äôre just at your core a sexual person! But if there‚Äôs more to it, you could perhaps explore other ways to feel validated in your relationships. 

Beyond that, you get to choose your own dealbreakers."

datingoverthirty,12v71x9,1682172650.0,How long can you wait for intimacy?,"UPDATE: well, problem solved- I got ghosted! 


Hey, I made a post on the rants and raves sticky last week about this and I decided maybe I should make a post for more input. I‚Äôm seeing this guy and things are really good. He checks all the boxes and we click in all the ways (almost.) The almost is that after 4 dates the most we have done is hold hands (over 2 months). I am Not used to moving this slow and it‚Äôs making me feel friend-zoned, restless, and like the relationship (?) is stalled out. We have talked about it and I‚Äôm confident that he wants to move things forward and is interested in my romantically and sexually. However the lack of touch and physical  intimacy is tripping me out. To make things more complicated we don‚Äôt get to see each other more than maybe once every 1 of 2 weeks, which is fine, because I‚Äôm busy too. I think that the pace of things compounded by the infrequency of in person time together is wearing on me. I‚Äôm fine with the amount of time we spend together, but it doesn‚Äôt feel like quality time due to the lack of the element of touch. Tbh, I‚Äôm starting to lose interest. Fast. And I don‚Äôt want to because he‚Äôs great. I feel like this is a movie that‚Äôs probably great but starts off too slow and has a 30 minute long camera pan of the landscape with no dialogue at the beginning of the movie. I would never want him to feel pressured or rushed at all, but I don‚Äôt know that I want to hang around much longer. 

Anyway, have y‚Äôall run into this in the past and how have you handled it? Do you possibly have any insight here? How long are you willing to wait for intimacy before you move on?

Update: yes I‚Äôve communicated my needs on multiple occasions as directly as one can. I‚Äôve opened the subject and offered him space and invited him to talk to me about what‚Äôs going on on his part. He didn‚Äôt indicate any issues or barriers and yet‚Ä¶ here we are. 

We went on a very public date again and I had a great time. When we were done I tried to lead into another activity maybe grab a drink or just talk by our cars and try and give him at least a peck there. He didn‚Äôt really follow. He had something to do after the date and had to go so no drink and he gave me a goodbye hug far away from our cars out in the middle of all the people around us and went the other direction to his car vs walking me to my car to say goodbye. So naturally, nothing happened. I didn‚Äôt just go for it in the middle of a bunch of ppl because I‚Äôm not into pda like that and I don‚Äôt want a first kiss executed like that. So I tried to Segway into a more intimate or private environment for the attempt and he was not leading where I was following.

 If we have another date (idk at this point) then I‚Äôm gonna suggest a movie and take out at my place or something at night/evening. At this point, I‚Äôm not feeling as secure in things(as silly as that sounds considering all of this). Part of that‚Äôs on me and my personal history, so I‚Äôm keeping it in check. I‚Äôm used to having negative responses and outcomes when expressing any kind of need in a relationship. He did not respond to me like that, so I know how I feel is partially just muscle memory and has nothing to do with him.

I really do like him a lot, and Im going to really make an effort to go for it when I get another chance. Thinking back to some things he told me about past relationships, I think I really might need to take the wheel in terms of sex. It sounds like women he‚Äôs dated in the past really did drive the relationship and he just kind of rode along. I don‚Äôt like that dynamic for myself,  but if that‚Äôs what he‚Äôs used to, I can understand him having a hard time breaking out of that pattern. However, that is a whole separate issue and series of conversations to have. Just getting to know each other he has seen that I‚Äôm not like that and that I have the expectation of having and being a partner, not a dependent. Anyway, at this point, I figure I‚Äôll just make a point to channel my inner Artemis and Venus and more actively engage in pursuit. We‚Äôll see what happens. I‚Äôll keep updating if anyone is interest in that. Hoping the next update is about a victorious conquest.","I had a date that had zero physical touch until date 5 where I had to fully go in for the quick kiss and then you hadn't kissed me yet!  after that barrier was broken, everything was fine lol maybe you just need to initiate it?

that being said the bigger issue to me is 4 dates over 2 months?  I'd personally have a hard time feeling any connection with someone I was seeing that rarely...maybe that's what's making it more difficult?"
datingoverthirty,12v512r,1682167838.0,How to avoid the paradox of choice in dating?,"Hi r/datingoverthirty,

I recently re-read Modern Romance by Aziz Ansari. In the book he talks about the ‚Äòparadox of choice‚Äô in relation to online dating. Because of the ease of meeting new and exciting potential matches, people can notice tiny flaws in their dates and feel there might be someone out there who‚Äôs a slightly better fit for us, even if they may not exist. This practice has been described as ‚Äòmaximising‚Äô. I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôre all guilty of this to some extent. 

This is something I want to avoid when I restart my dating journey. I want to recognize a good match when I see them, accept the small flaws and not obsess over the ‚Äòwhat if‚Äôs‚Äô. This has behaviour, in contrast, has been described as ‚Äòsatisficing‚Äô.

In the book he suggests engaging in interesting or activity-based dates to try and foster a meaningful connection opposed to ‚Äòresume review‚Äô dates over just drinks. He also suggests a 2 date minimum rule to ensure you‚Äôve really given your match a fair shot. 

I was wondering whether anyone has any advice about how they avoid writing dates off too quickly for small imperfections? AND ALSO has anyone managed to avoid getting written off for small imperfections? I remember bringing this up at a date once so we were both conscious of the satisficing practice. 

As always, I want to thank this community for the invaluable advice you‚Äôve given me in my quest for love! I even shaved my balding hair last week thanks to advice from this sub, haha!",Keeping top of mind that I myself am not perfect helps nurture grace/tolerance (and even appreciation) for other‚Äôs imperfections.

datingoverthirty,12tefue,1682023228.0,Taking way too long to get over a situationship!,"Hi all,

I‚Äôm having a hard getting over a situationship and I‚Äôm a bit worried at how long this is taking me! 

I (30F) have been seeing this person (34M) on and off for around 1 year - alternating a few months of seeing each other to a few months of separation initiated by him for no apparent reason (commitment phobe vibes although he did reiterate that he was looking for a serious relationship.. I guess not with me), then followed by him coming back. 
I put an end to it in December when he showed no real interest once again and I felt treated like a booty call.

Fast forward to now, I still find myself missing him so much, there‚Äôs so many things I‚Äôd like his opinion on, or I‚Äôd like to tell him or ask him for advice. It ended quite badly too - he basically ghosted, that obviously left an even more sour taste in my mouth. The sexual chemistry was amazing but what I really miss is our chats, I just felt so at ease and we like so many of the same things, I just find him an incredibly interesting and stimulating person. 
I‚Äôm not blind to his flaws btw - but I have to admit in all honesty that he‚Äôs the person I‚Äôve most felt connected so far even if what we had was rather brief and not official. I‚Äôd be happy to even have him in my life as a friend if he doesn‚Äôt see me romantically - this is how much I find him cool and great to be around.

Anyway my point is, despite doing plenty of things during these months of separation (travelled, changed jobs, tried out new things, made new friends, picked up new hobbies), I just find myself still so sad about all of this and there are nights where this nostalgic feeling is so damn piercing. I‚Äôm worried because I‚Äôm 30, not a teenager, and seriously worried that this is impacting me longer and more strongly than I was hoping. The fact we are not even talking at all doesn‚Äôt help I guess.

1. A lot of women I know like getting compliments from their dates, but don't expect to give them back. A simple, ""that shirt looks great on you!"" Or ""you look really nice!"" Can go a long way.  

2. Initiating physical contact is a simple way to show interest. I initiate hugs hello/goodbye, but also when I'm tired, stressed, cold, and just really happy. These are hugs that linger, with squeezes. This isn't a first date thing, but within 2 months, it's probably happening. Similarly, touching someone's arm, rubbing someone's back, and even just leaning on close when you're chatting can convey interest.     

3. A lot of posts on this sub are from women who always wait for the guy to initiate contact. As with 1 above, this doesn't need to be complicated. ""Hey, just thinking of you and wanted to say hey. Looking forward to our date tomorrow üòä.""  ""I am still laughing about your xyz comment last night! Thanks for always making me smile!"" Etc."

So after a few dating horror stories I (32f) met somebody (32m) that I really like !

We're seeing each other for a month now. I know it's still very fresh but I find him really caring, intelligent and kind so far.

I told him I wanted to wait for having sex. I need to feel safe, to feel like I know someone, not in details, but like I can grasp an idea of what you are. 

He was ok with that even though I know he has a high sex drive and might have been ok for sex since our first date. He has really respected my boundary, I don't feel any pressure, and lately, with all that good time spent together, I'm feeling ok to move on to the next step.

We kiss and cuddle a lot. A lot of heavy making out too. A few days ago, I invited him over, and for me it was clear we would have sex. But it made me so anxious, (maybe I like him way too much !) my body couldn't relax, didn't feel a lot of things, and was even painful at some point. It was clearly meh. He said that we'll work on it, and surely get better with time.

We have a great connection ; after all that mess, he's still asked me for exclusivity, I said yes. 

Now, I'd like to be able to relax for our next encounter. I like this guy !! I'd like to be sure he knows it.

You were nervous, you told him, he said understood and you'd both work together on it.  This is where it isn't an issue anymore.

I was bummed cause I thought I had scored but then that was a total turn off! If you wonder exactly what I mean, it was too much tongue taking up the whole real estate of my mouth - I could barely kiss him back in that state and it was unappealing to me. 

So my question for discussion is, is this lack of kissing compatibility something I can work with, or is it just an incompatibility that might even mean other incompatibilities? On the surface it seems like such a trivial thing to be the deal-breaker, but on the other hand, if he likes to kiss that way and I don't, then I don't want him to have to change that for me. Also, I was with someone for 6 years and I never really liked the way they kissed, even when I would try to show how I preferred it it never improved for me, and I was relieved that I didn't have to kiss them again even though I was attracted to them! So maybe it is a deal-breaker for me. Agh, tell me your thoughts/experiences!","If everything else is great, just talk to them about how you prefer to be kissed. After not really enjoying the first makeout with a guy I'd just started dating, I told him I felt it was too much tongue, that for me tongue should be used sparingly and that I needed to really work up to it before it's brought in. He listened to me and we've been happily together for 2 years."
datingoverthirty,12r10gf,1681845677.0,Conversations to have at/around the 6 month mark?,"Just curious to see what DOT thinks. (reposting because my original post was removed for lacking context)

Assuming everything is going well in a relationship (e.g. exclusivity has been established, family is being introduced, no dealbreakers have arisen, communication and attachments are healthy, I-love-yous have been exchanged) what topics are due to be discussed at or around the 6 month mark?

I‚Äôm asking because everything is going really well with my bf, I want to talk about moving in together and marriage down the road. The only reason I‚Äôm hesitant is because in my last ltr my ex had become really hostile at any conversation he perceived as ‚Äúpushy‚Äù. The memories of his outbursts have made me second guess if it‚Äôs appropriate to bring things like this up or when, and I could use some outside perspective. I love my bf, I can without a doubt see myself spending the rest of my life with him, which is why I‚Äôm so afraid of bringing up something too early and messing things up. 

Is it too soon to ask him to look down the road and give me some confirmation about where things are going? If he doesn‚Äôt see this heading towards marriage I want to know sooner than later, but I also don‚Äôt want him to feel pressured into making promises prematurely.","If those are the conversations you‚Äôd like to have then I say you should absolutely have them


in regards to your ex, I have no idea how those convos went so it‚Äôs impossible for me to tell if you were pushy or not. But just because he thought you were pushy doesn‚Äôt mean you were. He could‚Äôve been overreacting to you broaching a subject and while it sucks that he had outbursts, it tells me that he might be very emotionally immature


here‚Äôs my general thought with ANY sort of conversation with ANYONE (not just romantic partners): **as long as you discuss a subject authentically, understandingly and compassionately, no topic is off-limits**

and I really mean that. Everyone has opinions and things they like. You should absolutely bring those up. But also understand that while you have your perspective, the other person has theirs. The relationships that are successful are so because the people in them know how to work with one another when a disagreement arises"
datingoverthirty,12qr2yx,1681831034.0,Reconnecting with an ex?,"I (30sF) recently reconnected with a guy (30s) that I was seeing for a few months last year. Things had ended with him, the reason he gave was because I was being a bit of a nag at the end. I recently reached out and we met up and talked after a few months of not seeing each other, to me it felt like we picked right back up where things left off.

I may still have lingering feelings for him and would be open to more with him if he was open to it as well. We've seen each other twice since reconnecting - I initiated both invites. I would like to see him again this week, but I don't know if I'm coming on too strong in the event that he is only looking for a hook up. Looking for perspective, would it be too soon to ask him to hang out again? Should I give him space and time and see if he reaches out to me or does it not matter and should I just go after what I want amd message him to make plans? I'm not sure if he only sees me as a potential FWB or if he would want to reconnect?

UPDATE: to clarify on the nagginess/wanting to see him more, when we were together we did see each other 2 to 3 times a week with staying over each other's places each time we saw each other. I think part of the issue what I am very type A, ""let's have a plan set so I know when something will happen"" and he is more go with the flow and let things happen as it comes...","Since he was the one that ended things I would let him make the move unless you can't deal with the ambiguity. Imo when someone rejects you, the ball is in their court for reconsideration. Otherwise I'd assume it's just friendship or hooking up unless they articulate otherwise.

 In this case, in all honesty it's not looking good. You already initiated both hang outs. I would resist the urge to think ""if I hang out with him just once more, he'll realize how good we are together."" That logic rarely ends well.

I would be interested in knowing what ""nagging"" was in this case because that's a pretty unflattering term for him to use against you. Do you feel like you or he has made changes to where this issue wouldn't pop up again?"

My birthday was yesterday and she made the entire weekend magical.  Last week I had gotten food poisoning so I was afraid I really wasn't going be able to enjoy myself, but she took expert care of me all week.  I started to rally around Friday, when we were able to grill on her rooftop for the first time this year, one of my favorite activities from last summer when we started going out.  Saturday she took me out to a baseball game on a beautiful summerlike day, as my favorite team was visiting.  Afterwards we went back for the first time to the bar where we had our first date, and reminisced about how far we've come (and how far we are excited to go).

Sunday we had a couple of delicious celebratory meals out and otherwise relaxed at home.   
Yesterday she put up decorations, gave me a beautiful card, and procured my favorite kind of cake (white chocolate raspberry cheesecake, which I had mentioned to her months ago).

datingoverthirty,12qe2vp,1681801071.0,Advice for my profile,"It seems like it's mostly men who ask for profile advice - I want to know what this sub thinks about my profile. I am pansexual so I am marketing to all sides of the street.

The Halloween costume is in GIF-form and was a brain-child of me and my close friend because most (in Sweden) have bikini photos which I don't have any of - this was my way of cheekily showing off my body type without showing too much skin or being entirely too sexual to get any serious contacts. The GIF is only of me turning my hips from side to side to show off the costume.

I have Tinder Gold so I can see who swiped right on me and decide if I find them an attractive possibility. I suck at finding anyone to date outside of online dating as well - I have had an 100% denial rate with the people I have approached for dates since I was 16.

\-Photos are cute but too many selfies

\-Overall comes across as a bit juvenile? Like not ""you seem immature"" but more like you'd register as ""feels too young to date"" if I was evaluating the male version of you for myself. The first photo in overalls you look reaaaally young thanks to the stance, angle, etc, a dress that looks honestly like a prom dress, posing with alcohol, calling yourself a MILF, calling yourself adorable, lists a dream job even though you're in your 30s - not that it means you can't have one but if you're not actually on a path to be a lawyer, I would find this odd and be the type of thing a younger person thinks is important to share about themselves (again this might be the American perspective!)

datingoverthirty,12q8gcr,1681787949.0,Question from a woman to hetero men: Do emotional conversations lead to physical arousal?,"I had an interesting experience with a guy I've been dating for a few months (we are both in our late 30s, if it matters).

Since the beginning he has been very guarded, and prefers to have more surface-level conversations. He says it takes him time to open up, and when he does it is only with a few people. I've been a little frustrated with this, but am trying to be patient. Last week he got upset with me about something (I didn't find out what it was until later), and went into his cocoon for 3-4 days. We stayed in touch over text, but I could tell that things weren't the same and asked a few times if we could make some time to talk about it. When we finally talked, we realized that it was just a misunderstanding/ something he had misheard, and he was overcome by relief. I made a statement that was maybe more emotional than our normal mode of communication; I said ""We're on the same team. why would you think I'd do that to you?"". He immediately started making out with me; was inside me within seconds and had orgasmed in no time. Then he thanked me for saying that, and went to sleep.

I've never experienced something like this before...what do I make of it?

Edit in response to initial comments: To me, it was a bit unsatisfying. I would have liked to chat some more to make sure that we were \*both\* in a good place about it.","I would say that its more about what you said than emotional conversation on its own, the part where you said you were a team gave him a sense of security and probably triggered something in him. Why it was a fast one i domt know üòÖ"
datingoverthirty,12q0xmy,1681773041.0,only attract emotionally unavailable women,"I've looked back on the women who have been interested in me and that I've been in relationships, and they all were very either depressed or carried a lot of unresolved trauma. It seems like I can't really find someone who is somewhat emotionally available or in a healthy place. It's definitely given my self-confidence a big hit lately as I feel I'm only good enough for very emotionally unavailable women. 

The ones I have dated seem to always end the relationship as they begin to feel better or have begun to work through their trauma or depression. 

I'm not sure how to fix this or find someone more emotionally available?","Two thoughts.  First, general advice: a large percentage of the dating population at our age is emotionally unavailable.  The causation here goes in both directions: having trouble with emotional availability decreases one's chances of an LTR (i.e. a higher percentage of emotionally available people got in relationships and stayed there before reaching their 30s), and a lot of people who find themselves single in their 30s have been hurt and gone through things that they react to by closing themselves off emotionally.  So, please don't frame it as ""continually running into emotionally unavailable people says something about *my* worth.""  It definitely doesn't.  
  
Second, *that being said*: you say ""I only attract X women,"" but we don't know anything about your traits - where you're at (geographically and in life), what kind of work you do, what you're looking for.  I'm **not** saying ""please give us more info and then we'll respond.""  Rather, my suggestion is that it might be helpful to go through ""who you are"" and think about whether there's a particular trait or two that you have that these women seem to be drawn to, and whether there's a particular trait *these women* have that you are drawn to (before you assess emotional unavailability).  If you identify anything, consider whether it might be worth trying something different with those things going forward. 
  
Just as a random example, absolutely *not* saying this is true of you: someone who consistently attracts people who have trauma to work through might realize their OLD profile and early in-person communication suggest that they're ""a shoulder to cry on,"" and that the way they've learned to show care is by comforting people when things aren't going well.  Awareness of this could help that person develop healthier early boundaries re: trauma and better suggest that they're not just looking to help someone through their problems, but are especially excited to amplify the life of someone who feels like they're ready to take the next step *after* doing a lot of work on themselves.

datingoverthirty,12or7q3,1681683511.0,How to not come on too strong but also move things forward? 39/M heartbroken and confused.,"So I recently got faded by a woman (33/f) who I had developed a pretty deep emotional connection with over the course of 3 months. We only saw each other twice and made out in terms of physical intimacy, but I think it‚Äôs safe to say the sexual chemistry was strong. She has a 9 year old daughter and is very cautious with having sex b/c she ‚Äògets really vulnerable‚Äô when she does, so I accepted that and didn‚Äôt give her any grief on that. Didn‚Äôt change my feelings for her, I don‚Äôt mind to wait. However, each time we started getting closer ‚Äî over text and phone calls (long phone calls)‚Äî she‚Äôd start pulling away. I‚Äôd back off, then she‚Äôd initiate contact within a day or two. This happened a handful of times. If it weren‚Äôt for the fact that I could see myself with her long term I would not have stayed in it, and she always thanked me for being patient and kind with her. And every time I backed off she was overjoyed to connect again, so that told me that she has strong feelings as well. 
Well, last week we were texting every day, me initiating about 2/3 of texts and half and half on calls, and she gets cold again. I just couldn‚Äôt take it anymore and basically accused her of seeing someone else (she had already told me she wasn‚Äôt taking to anyone else). I kind of wanted her to either confirm it or assure me she wasn‚Äôt. Instead she got very defensive and told me she was done. I just didn‚Äôt feel secure with her the whole time but the connection and compatibility we had in every conceivable way other than communication/attachment style was so strong. I‚Äôm just really down about it and not even sure what lesson to learn. I played it cool for the first month or so and let her come to me, while making sure to move it forward (which she likes anyhow). But I did get attached after about 4-6 weeks and thought she was also attached, only to be devastated when she clearly either wasn‚Äôt or was avoiding it. Perhaps I should have saved my feelings until I was certain she was also attached to me?","The absolute worst aspect of dating is that so many people are terrified of 'catching feelings', as kids call it.  Well what the hell is the point of dating?  What are we even doing here if you are trying not to catch feelings?

My honest opinion though is she sounds emotionally unavailable and you sound a bit insecure.  No reason to accuse her of seeing someone else  just becsuse she gets a little distant.  You can talk to her about it with accusing her if doing something wrong.  But I personally don't think it's at all weird to grow attached when a woman gives you attention.  That seems normal and healthy to me."

datingoverthirty,12mutos,1681545911.0,Guy [34M] told me [32F] that he ‚Äúwants to make friends and find his place‚Äù in the new country,"Went on a first date with this guy in the very beginning of January and we started seeing each other at a good pace. Very early on he asked me ""Do you think I am a bad communicator? Because I find texts important for arranging things predominantly, otherwise I am not paying much attention to chat"". And I told him that I have noticed it, but he was setting up regular dates, being respectful and making quite a lot of effort, so I thought to sit back and just get to know him, and let his actions speak instead of his words.

Fast forward 3 months and we are spending quite a lot of time together, and it is almost always initiated by him, one night on a week night and the weekend together as well, I was actually pleasantly surprised. He is an intelligent guy and affectionate in the way I like. Two weeks ago, he travelled to the other side of the world for his brother's wedding, when he came back, things were very different. He came to my place straight from the airport and seemed happy to see me like I was happy to see him, but the next days, he definitely changed. He was not unkind or rude, but he was not initiating physical affection, he was barely speaking, I was trying to make conversation almost to no avail. He was responsive to kisses and hugs, but he wouldn't reach out to touch me.

My mum is visiting this week and I knew that it was too early to introduce him to family, but I wanted to address it anyway, as I thought ""This guy has been prioritising me, spending so much time with me, being respectful etc etc"", I don't want him to feel insulted or anything so I told him something along the lines of ""During my mum's stay, I was wondering if it would be a good idea to arrange a dinner or so, but I think not right now, language barrier and her mobility issues, but it is not a reflection on how I see you, I happen to think you are super ;)"" or something along these lines. Added that I would still like to see him though, so let's go to my friend's Sunday barbecue. His response can be summed up to ""I like you and our relationship/time spent together, but I am new to X and I am still making friends and finding my place here, I don't want to jump into a serious relationship"". As background info, he came here from a neighbouring country around 11 months ago, I think after breaking up with ex that he used to live with. We speak about it on the phone, I ask him directly if he wants to see other people, he says ""Well, I am not using the apps anymore and I have deleted them from my phone, but if I am out and about, it may happen"". I asked him if this is how he always felt since we started dating, he said ""No, in the past two weeks I have started thinking to myself Hey, what are you doing""

So what now, people? I think this means he spent time with me, he got to know me, he realised I am not the one, and now he wants to move on, but keep me as a back up. I actually think that he threw himself a bit in the deep end and I would be happy to slow down things a bit, but I think the fact he considers meeting other people means he has moved way beyond this, as I do not want to see other people.",">I think this means he spent time with me, he got to know me, he realised I am not the one, and now he wants to move on, but keep me as a back up.

I'm looking at guys in their mid-late 30's and while I enjoy the classics; dinner, movies, drinks, theatre etc, sometimes you can get to know someone and see another side of them, where talking isn't the main focus. I also enjoy activities where unfortunately there would be a lot of kids, like bowling, arcades, crazy golf, the zoo, or whatever. (Nothing against kids, but it's not really the right atmosphere for dates lol).

Firstly, people in the same range/older, would you even consider this an issue at this age - if someone suggested one of these as a 2nd/3rd/4th date, would you think they were a bit immature or dorky? I know it depends on the person but I'm hoping to find out the general consensus!

Secondly, do you guys have any suggestions for dates that aren't ""let's get ice cream?""

Edit: you guys have been amazing, I didn't expect to get so much activity and respectful answers on this so thank you all.

I definitely think changing the perspective to, if they don't wanna do this fun thing, then it's a compatability thing - thank you to those who had that approach, and also highlighting that being 30+ doesn't mean you ""shouldn't"" enjoy these things. I've done relationships or very single for a while and having fun with the inbetween dating period is a bit more out my comfort zone, so appreciate the comments guys.

I'm down for walks, drinks and stuff early on for see if we click and who they are in person but there's only so many before it gets repetitive and you lose momentum and rapport-building.

We haven‚Äôt been on official, one on one date yet, but a lot of ‚Äúhey, come over for a movie and beer‚Äù, followed by me rejecting that and suggesting casual drinks in public with our friends instead. For our official date, he asked me out to dinner, then said that the restaurants in our area were going to be closed for the time we planned, suggested a burger stand then beer and movies at his place, which I rejected and then took him to a restaurant downtown that is well known for late night seatings. For context, we met through mutual friends, not online. Its irrelevant to this post, but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll go out with him again. 

Then tonight, some random dude (33m) from an app slid into my IG DM‚Äôs, asking me to ‚Äúsmoke and hang sometime‚Äù. We haven‚Äôt matched so i don‚Äôt have any information on this dude outside of his fish photos. Smoke and hang? Honey, I graduated from high school a long time ago, that does not appeal to me.

What happened to dating? Is it just the current social climate, or is it just the men that I‚Äôve been in contact with recently? How is everyone approaching their dates these days? Is it that I just happen to be talking to scrubs looking for a quick lay or am I truly out of touch with today‚Äôs dating norms?","The thing is, this isn‚Äôt dating. This is just lame dudes looking for a hookup. And because it‚Äôs no effort they can cast a wide net so many, many women get to encounter this pathetic behavior on a too frequent basis. Because of this it might feel like the norm but it‚Äôs not. 

The bare minimum: First dates could be simple and relaxed meet ups in a PUBLIC space that is equidistant between the two parties. Don‚Äôt bother with anyone trying to make less effort than this. 

There are so many options for dates that aren‚Äôt at THEIR place; it‚Äôs always just an attempt to push for sex. Whether it‚Äôs date 1 or date 10, if you‚Äôre not entertaining the idea of sleeping with them, don‚Äôt be fooled."

I‚Äôm 37/f, dating 45/m since November. It‚Äôs been wonderful. We‚Äôve spent the VAST majority of the time I don‚Äôt have my kids‚Ä¶with each other since then. And I‚Äôve loved it. 

However, I‚Äôm feeling like I need some, ‚Äúme‚Äù time. This Saturday my kids have soccer so I had planned to attend their games. Saturday night we have plans with his friends. He had mentioned going out in the afternoon prior to the plans. I agreed, but now I‚Äôm feeling really‚Ä¶eager to have an afternoon to myself‚Ä¶window shop at the mall, maybe getting a massage, spend a few hours with my horses. Things that made me feel good before getting together with him that I haven‚Äôt done in months. 

The plans we have for Saturday are absolutely still a priority but instead of going to a bar I kinda want to do my own thing. I rarely get any quality time to myself between work, kids and relationship and it‚Äôs something I‚Äôm starting to miss. 

Is this‚Ä¶not normal in a relationship? How do I communicate it? Has anyone else ever experienced this?","It's totally normal and healthy for both partners to need/want some separate alone time. If your partner is good and understanding, a simple ""I need some 'me' time on Saturday"" should be enough.

I personally see it as a red flag if my partner Doesn't understand needing occasional alone time."

datingoverthirty,12jthxn,1681321435.0,I (33F) want a real connection so I'm finally deleting OLD apps to focus on making an effort IRL,"I'm attractive, live in a big city and although I get a lot of matches, today I finally decided to delete Hinge. I'm snoozing my Bumble profile indefinitely because I still want to keep the app for the IRL events but won't use it to actively meet people.

I've tried pretty much every dating app under the sun (Tinder/OkCupid/Hinge/Bumble) on and off since I was 26-27 and although I've met some cool guys, at this point I'm ready for something serious and I just know I won't find it on an app. If it hasn't worked for me in that past 6+ years idk why all of the sudden it would start working now.

**I'm over the shallow nature of OLD. Attraction is so much more than finding someone good looking or who ticks all the boxes on a checklist. It's their voice, their mannerisms, their laughter, their humor, the way they move... all of which are incredibly hard, if not impossible, to gauge through an OLD profile.** 

**Out of every relationship/connection I've had in the past 6 years NONE of them have come from a dating app and I'm 99.99% sure that I would've swiped left on \*every\* guy I've actually connected with IRL.**

That's the part that gets to me. The men that I've actually connected with, either they didn't fall within the ""right"" age or height range I had set or they weren't as conventionally attractive as other men on there but it doesn't matter... the point is that if I had left it up to online dating I would've never even met them.

To take things further, I hate the endless banal small talk you have to engage in while typing on a tiny ass phone screen only to 1) have the guy not respond/randomly unmatch, 2) Have it turn into a penpal that goes nowhere, 3) Go on first date #297 only to quickly realize you didn't have chemistry/attraction in IRL.

**So what will I be doing instead?**

Anything and everything. Go to concerts. Sign up for a class. Attend mixers. Bumble IRL events. Join meetup groups. Join a sport/bowling/anything league. Hell, I might even give speed dating a try.

I figured I'd rather actually *live life* and have fun that way. Even if I don't end up meeting the love of my life by doing all these, I might come out of it with some amazing friendships and experiences :)

**What are your thoughts on meeting people through IRL vs OLD?**","I was you in the summer of 2021. Exhausted with those same feelings of banal drudgery and a zillion first dates to nowhere, I decided to end the cycle of toxicity. I deleted my apps and resigned myself to get out there, live my life and find someone organically along the way or not at all; 1950‚Äôs style. Three months later he walked into the martial arts class I was taking. It has been the best 1.5 years now and we‚Äôre talking of moving in together this summer with potential for engagement by the end of the year. 

SO glad I took that scary first step and broke my app addiction. Good luck out there!!"
datingoverthirty,12jni3f,1681308737.0,You never really know the wrong person..,"Hey all you daters over 30,

I ended up running into my ex's friend recently. This is an ex that I dated during the pandemic and felt like we've had an incredibly strong connection. It was odd dating someone during that time as most people can attest to - obviously with all the restrictions and most of your time revolving around that person, I developed an incredibly strong bond. In total we dated 8 - 9 months and I was blindsided with the breakup. I took it hard and stopped dating for about a year.

She had all these things that she disliked. She disliked living in big cities, hated dogs (???) and wine, went off to randomly study a psychology course - why she could never explain except she was ""interested in it"". I was the opposite, I loved living in a big city, dogs (!!!) and I had a plan of where I was going in my career and life. She had a horrible time communicating herself or getting deep with me, which I just chalked up to the way she was.

During the breakup, she was adamant she couldn't be friends with exes, which I took quite hard but it was the right decision in the end. Fast forward 2 years later, I ran into her friend and we briefly connected. Now she lives in a big city, owns a dog now, is a programmer. My feelings for her have long gone away, but I couldn't help but be surprised on how everything I've known about her wasn't true - or she'd massively changed as a person. It was like I dated this person that I got hung up on who I didn't really know at all.

Made me think about do we ever really know people who aren't right for you in the end.

I've recently met a girl where we've been dating for almost a year now. I know her really well and we're focused on growing together in a healthy manner - but the above sort of stuck with me on do you really know someone if they've done a 180.

Has anyone had an experience like when someone they dated and formed an incredible connection with was a completely different person once time has passed? Threw me for a bit of a loop.","if i may offer a buddhist perspective:

people are not static and unchanging. think about it from the perspective of ""you"" - your thoughts, emotions and body changes everyday. are you the same as the 15, 20 or 25yr old version of yourself? your worldview, desires and problems are constantly changing. we are nature and nature is alive and dynamic.

you aren't aware of it because you live in a world of concepts - you have a concept of who you are and who others are, and that is a static, unchanging thing. your concept of yourself and others doesn't change until something major happens, so it feels sudden even though it has been changing moment to moment. think of it like a shelf of arctic ice melting - the temperature grows subtly warmer everyday, but we don't notice until the moment it grows warm enough to break away. or how tectonic plates are always shifting and we don't realize it until and earthquake happens. or a weightloss journey where you slowly lose weight every week, but your friends are only aware once you've lost 15lbs.

the other thing to keep in mind is that **you cannot see people outside of your own perception.** just because you experienced this woman as a horrible communicator who could not go ""deep"" with you, that does not mean that is who she is or everyone else would be forced to experience her that way. how you experienced her was being filtered through the lens of your past experiences, your desires and what you label as good and bad. you cannot see who she truly is outside of those things. 

tldr: we see people as we are, not as they are."

datingoverthirty,12ix7ln,1681246267.0,Conversations with OLD matches,"Hey DOT,

A few questions.

1. For the ladies: How often do you start a conversation with an OLD match on apps other than Bumble?

2. For everyone: What's the longest amount of time it's taken for you or the other person to start a conversation after you've matched?

3. For everyone: What's your usual texting frequency on the apps? Do you like to message with people throughout the day or do you wait until after work and set aside specific time for it?

I'm dipping my toes back in the dating pool after a long break and I'm curious what other people's experiences are.","I like to message within a day. If I don't get a response within 4 or 5 days, I unmatch. I like to exchange 1 to 2 messages per person per day for a few days and then suggest a meeting. Usually those messages are before work, lunch, after work or right before bed."
datingoverthirty,12iv0c5,1681242022.0,What do you do when you run out of hobbies?,"I simplified it in the title, but I'm essentially asking what people do when they grow exhausted of doing their hobbies, trying new things, meeting new people, traveling to new places, etc. and simply want the option to do romantic things with a romantic partner that doesn't exist?

I don't use OLD, but I'm starting to get burnt out on the things I've always loved to do and the things I continue to discover that I like to do because I'm feeling forced into them by my circumstances. I've got lots of friends and making more, lots of hobbies and finding more, invest a good amount of my time in a fruitful self care routine, including near-daily gym exercise and outdoor activities, and do my best to stay connected with family near and far. 

I am in therapy but have yet to find any solutions to these feelings other than to find a romantic partner.

Obviously I do these things because I enjoy them, but at this point I'm starting to resent that these are my only options and I sometimes feel forced to do them out of boredom and lack of a romantic partner to do other things with. I'm scared (strong wording, not sure how else to describe it) that once I fully tire of doing all these things, I'll have nothing left because I'm still alone. 

Any advice or suggestions?

ETA: I am doing these things because I like them, not because I'm trying to meet the love of my life. I'm just getting burnt out.","Personally: when I was single, I would accept that frustration, remind myself that feeling lonely and unhappy about it is valid, and then go grab drinks with my friends and work on moving on. 

It's totally fair and normal to feel unhappy about being single when you don't want to be. Hobbies and exercise won't stop you from feeling that lack in your life, necessarily. It's okay to let yourself feel sad/frustrated about being single, sometimes. 

Then you dust yourself off, and you move on. You should enjoy your hobbies because they're your hobbies, not because they're a substitute for something else. Your friends are important for the friendship they bring into your life. They're not going to fulfill the same spot in your life that a romantic partner would. You're going to feel that. And that's okay. 

Keep up with the therapy. Talk to your therapist about strategies for dealing with the pain. Don't let your friendships crumble because you wish you weren't single, though. Good friends are so incredibly important and valuable."

Your main pic: you're not looking at the camera and it's not the most flattering picture, but it's nice to see you dressed up :)

The photo with the sunglasses and mohawk: I don't see the point of this picture. It's too close up, you're wearing sunglasses so we can't really see what you look like.

The other photos are okay, but how recent are they? Some look like they could be old compared to your main pic (I'm thinking of the red shirt pic in particular). The last photo with side profile under the fire escape is okay, but I would replace it with a full body pic or some kind of action shot. 

None of these photos are really showing personality."

datingoverthirty,12i682u,1681182091.0,How do you determine when it's a lack of chemistry/compatibility and when it's not giving something enough of a chance?,"<Edit>  
Going to remove some details in case this person has a reddit account but thank you all for the great comments! It gave me things to think about and work on. 

-----

My main question is how you handle this in your own dating life because I'm curious how people differ. How many dates do you give it before you decide not to keep going? What needs to happen in that number of dates for you to feel interested in continuing? 

What helps you tell whether it's not having a connection with someone, versus you dipping out of something too early, focusing too much on unrealistic expectations of ""chemistry"", or only being drawn to the excitement of people who are bad for you in some way, whether that's triggering your anxiety or reenacting familiar but toxic patterns?

-----

But of course I did get to thinking about this because of something in my own life! I went out a few times with someone, but spaced weeks apart due to schedule conflicts. First date: enjoyable conversation for a few hours. Second date: I think we both had fun but the vibes of the location were weird and I felt like sparks were not flying. But we kissed and it was a good kiss! Third date: we had to change plans suddenly and frankly I did a shit job of replanning. The locations were even more awkward, the conversation was a dud, and when they kissed me at the end, I wasn't feeling it so I did a shit job of that too. That was several weeks ago. Neither of us has reached out after sending goodnight texts.

Lately I've gotten involved with a few people who I've felt ""chemistry"" with because they're pretty and start touching me early on, but they've turned out not really have their emotional shit together and not actually have that much physical or relational chemistry with me. This person seems like they're healthy, I had a nice time, and there wasn't anything that stood out to me as something I disliked about them. We just would hit lulls in the conversations after a couple hours and I kept walking away feeling like we weren't ""clicking"". They're attractive to me, are interested in me, and have qualities I like. Was it actually not a connection worth pursuing? Or lack of momentum due to the timing of the dates? Bad locations? Early-date jitters? 

I'm thinking about reaching back out. But it's been a long time of silence, so should I chalk this up as a learning experience and move on? Or, does it sound like I really do not have a connection with them?","For me as a 28F, after so many matches, this is how I roll.

I chat with someone for about 5 days to a week to screen dealbreakers and get an idea if we‚Äôre on the same page then schedule a meet up if we‚Äôre interested.

First date is a vibe/attraction check. If I‚Äôm really interested, I‚Äôd ask more questions if not, I just enjoy it. Generally within date one to two I know if I‚Äôm attracted to them. I don‚Äôt need a whole lot but a tiny bit to get started. Date 1-3 determine if I wish to see them further. If I don‚Äôt feel anything I stop at max date 2-3. 

Emotional connection and compatibility takes time to develop and learn. So I used attraction (like a tiny bit) to help me decide if I proceed. Of course, in the meantime, I ask about core values/etc., to figure out compatibility and such.

So generally, I don‚Äôt see a person more than maximum 3 dates unless I feel some sort of chemistry or attraction."

There are some forms of healing that could take place while dating but I don't know that this is one of them. 

If you don't take the time to grieve your ex who passed and to grieve that relationship, those unhealed wounds can have a negative impact on your next relationship. This can actually undermine your pursuit of a partner and motherhood.

I get the biological clock thing, but if you don't prioritize your mental health and well being, remember that also impacts your ability to be a good partner and mother.

I'm not saying you can't *try* dating again, but you absolutely need to be honest with yourself about how it's going and be willing to stop if you need more time to heal."

datingoverthirty,12gpati,1681060437.0,Do I get back together with him?,"I broke up with my boyfriend because his ADHD conflicts with my ADHD. I am medicated and he is not. He‚Äôs 50 and doesn‚Äôt have health insurance. This is an issue for me.


Cons:
He loves to talk, a lot, and about himself, always has to mention when he sees a car he likes, ruins movie and show plots for me so much that I don‚Äôt even want to watch them, doesn‚Äôt deep clean his house (gag), doesn‚Äôt have health insurance and he needs it, says I do so much for him in terms of introducing him to new hobbies, but doesn‚Äôt actually know anything about me and doesn‚Äôt ask (he always just reverts back to talking about himself, movies, or cars‚ÄîI could not care less).

Pros:
Otherwise he is a genuinely sweet person, some people call him too nice for his own good, everyone likes him, he is successful in his career choice, he‚Äôs funny, he‚Äôs a great partner, great friend, and cares a lot.

We had been dating for 6 months before I looked at him one night last week, knew I wasn‚Äôt in love with him, and just told him that I think he should go home because I couldn‚Äôt stand the thought of sleeping in bed with someone who acts more like a brother than a lover.

Otherwise, this has been the most emotionally mature relationship I‚Äôve ever been in. My dad likes him. I feel safe with him. We‚Äôve never really yelled at each other or gotten into an argument, but part of me thinks that is only this way because he‚Äôs desperate to find someone. For context, I (F) am 29 and he (M) is 50.

Many ‚Äúgood family men‚Äù have been sneaking around having affairs and doing all kinds of shady things. Jumping back into the dating pool after a divorce is scary and there are a lot of turds floating around so I really love how everyone has come together to hype and protect each other. 
 
 
On the other hand‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs ripe for abuse. Scorned, abusive, crazy women can easily take advantage of the platform to badmouth and humiliate their exes. For some reason, I didn‚Äôt even consider this aspect until I saw a post made about my ex the other day and it‚Äôs been weighing on me heavily. 
 
 
 
The only real rule of the group is that you can‚Äôt screenshot or share any of the information with anyone, especially the men posted. Which makes great sense because the women deserve to be safe from potential retaliation from their abusers. I think it‚Äôs a great rule.
 
 
But seeing my ex‚Äôs sweet face plastered on the wall of that group by a woman he‚Äôs been dating for a couple weeks looking for ‚Äútea‚Äù before she gets ‚Äútoo involved,‚Äù publicly listing his ‚Äúred flags‚Äù for all the world to see and judge, vulnerable things he told her in confidence thinking he could trust her makes me furious.
 
 
Her reasoning for posting him and sharing this stuff was because he told her he wasn‚Äôt seeing anyone else but she wasn‚Äôt sure if she believed him and she didn‚Äôt want to fall into another ‚Äútoxic‚Äù relationship.
 
 
Of the two red flags she decided to share with damn near every single woman in our entire state, one was totally distorted and taken out of context and the other was just blatantly untrue. Both are things that can hurt his family and career. And this woman was totally willing to smear and humiliate him behind his back with no regard for how it affected his life, but also the other people involved. 
 
 
Like wtf?!
 
 
I can‚Äôt tell him without breaking both the little secrecy oath I took for group, which I wholeheartedly believe in because again-safety, and no contact, which is important to keep.
 
 
Our breakup was brutal. We both made mistakes but neither deserve to have them, along with the rest of our private life, distorted and blasted by some stranger sneaking around trying to get dirt on a guy she‚Äôs ‚Äúvery interested in.‚Äù 
 
 
But after seeing the women pile on to trash talk him like vultures based on this woman‚Äôs post, knowing it would break his heart and embarrass him more than he can stand, I felt obligated to chime in and clear it up‚Ä¶ Which required me publicly trashing myself and sharing humiliating, vulnerable information I‚Äôd prefer judgmental strangers not know about me.
 
 
It sucks. 
 
 
And after all was said and done, she came back and updated the post to say she decided to go with ‚Äúthe other guys waiting in line to take his place‚Äù and hadn‚Äôt stopped dating other men‚Ä¶ So she was doing the exact thing she called toxic and was so worried about and he wasn‚Äôt. Not a single woman called her out on the dichotomy of her thinking. Fortunately, several women commented that he shouldn‚Äôt have been posted but the damage is done. For both of us. 
 
 
 
I‚Äôm just furious that some rando crazy woman felt encouraged to destroy the reputation of a man she just started dating because she was insecure and jealous that he wasn‚Äôt paying her enough attention. And while I‚Äôm grateful for the grace and kindness of the women that responded to my comments basically making myself look like a monster to defend him against the attacks, I‚Äôm wondering why there was none for him when they were under the impression that he had done those very things.
 
 
 
I still feel like the intentions of the group and the majority of the women are good and pure but I‚Äôm really disliking realizing how toxic and dangerous it is. When the purpose of the group is to expose bad men and protect good women, that‚Äôs the lens everyone will look through. 
 
 
I‚Äôm wondering how many lives have been ruined by this type of selfish, conniving, thoughtless behavior but also wondering how many have been helped and even saved from the good women that put their own vulnerabilities out there to protect others from the same pain.

 
 
I know I don‚Äôt personally want to be a part of it anymore. But I thought it would be good to talk about it. They‚Äôre gaining traction fast now and someone told me they‚Äôre in just about every major city in the US. It‚Äôs kind of a big deal..
 
 
As far as I‚Äôm aware, the men‚Äôs groups aren‚Äôt much better, although less popular. My friend joined and told me it‚Äôs mostly just men either complaining their bonkers ex posted them in our group or saying pretty vile, descriptive things regarding the sexuality and experiences with the women they dated. I don‚Äôt like it.
 
 
We can‚Äôt take this stuff back, guys.","I've never logged on to one because I think they're toxic and morally wrong. Just like I never send around those pictures/captions on FB of people trying to shame other people. I have no idea what the circumstances are behind that information and therefore I shouldn't spread it. It's basically defamation.

I think something like this COULD be beneficial but there are too many ways for it to become abusive. Just like in your example. These are people's real lives, careers, families, etc that are affected. I think that some women use their own safety as an excuse to be terrible human beings."

Hi everyone, I'm getting back on the OLD horse this week and wanted to get more eyes on my profile. My lack of group photos I think is an issue but I don't have a huge group of friends where I live and well I'm older so I don't see friends in large groups anymore anyway. Also, I've lost significant weight in the last year so any 2-3 year old group photos are not how I look now. Got a limited library to work with.

The caption for the snowboard photo is ""How I Fight the Sunday Scaries"" I cropped by accident.

I want to use the prompts to portray how much I value deep emotional connection but also know that can be off putting so I'm uncertain if I should just make it all lighthearted. I've been told I'm funny and people seem to enjoy my company but I want to try to stand out from the other just ""fluent in sarcasm"" type things on these profiles.

Looking forward to your feedback! Thanks in advance!",Your whole personality in your profile is a mix of health and extreme sports. I think it‚Äôs great to show some of this but honestly that‚Äôs all I have taken in after viewing it.

I really enjoyed my experience with him but couldn‚Äôt see myself being with him long term. He seemed really good on paper, but we definitely had different values.

I think he felt a little blindsided and we stayed in touch for a couple of months before he started dating someone else. I do think I also kept in touch for a bit hoping that maybe we‚Äôd reconcile.

For the past year, I‚Äôve been seeing someone who I really like and can see myself being with long term. I love him, we have a ton of fun together, and I can‚Äôt see myself being with anyone else.

BUT I STILL THINK ABOUT MY EX ALMOST DAILY. And I have no idea why! I‚Äôm not missing any closure. I don‚Äôt want to go back to him. I have other exes that I don‚Äôt ever think about. I‚Äôm really happy right now so I just don‚Äôt get it. 

The thoughts I have are just memories of things we did or thoughts of how he‚Äôs doing. Occasionally I think of how he‚Äôs feeling in his new relationship and of course if he‚Äôs happier than when he was with me.

I really feel bad for having these thoughts when I‚Äôm doing so well with my new person! He doesn‚Äôt give me any reason to feel anxious and I really enjoy him and want to be with him. In fact, if you put both of them in front of me, I would choose my current partner.

datingoverthirty,12evqla,1680894405.0,How do I stop giving off friendly vibes?,"I \[M32\] have been on a few first OLD dates the past months.

After that first date the feedback was often that she enjoyed the date but she's feeling more friendly vibes, somtimes even interested in seeing each other again but only as friends. The way I interpret it is that they did enjoy genuinely have a good time but didn't feel any romantic attraction.

On the one hand I can totally understand that, a romantic connection doesn't always happen and I've had dates where I was the one who wasn't feeling a spark. But this is also leaving me confused and a little frustrated, and it's making me think that I'm doing something super wrong, or that I'm sending off any sort of red flags that I'm not aware of, that I'm not flirty enough, or maybe that I need more time than one date to really open up to someone.

datingoverthirty,12eluuo,1680875170.0,"30F, 28M do i let this die or can i make this right?","AITA- how do I 30F reach out after plans fell through a few times after an awkward date with 28M?

Below are some options for how I can handle this. So, I began dating someone in December. He was quite romantic in-person, but we couldn't see each other for a month as he was abroad and then after our second date we both were traveling a lot and dates kept not aligning but we both kept trying and we continued the connection. 

When he tried to schedule our 3rd date, it was a bar near his house late at night, so i was a bit flakey however he got in touch and after i expressed not being down for late night bar dates and wasn‚Äôt available that weekend anyway he rescheduled for following week and arranged instead a very thoughtful event planned ahead and altered his travels to see me when I was in town! however he said relationship was low priority but he liked me a lot, and wanted a strong emotional connection and fun. The next few dates got kind of awkward as I didn't allow him escalate intimacy as much as he wanted in those moments and he said it was going slow so there was some tension between us, making me feel a little uncertain and made me hesitant so i was late twice which annoyed him but he still said he wanted to go on dates with me and asked me to let him know about Sleepovers.

After our last meet, he reached out 5 days later and asked me out on another date but I was traveling and asked about Saturday sleepovers (I go to school 3 hours away, but I'm from/go to his city often) this weekend or next. He said he is availbale any day except for that saturday at 6pm, and the following Sat would be traveling but i could sleep over sunday. I said I'd let him know asap but told him sunday i couldnt make it and lets chat about travel plans. No response. 

I wrote that friday to ask about his travel plans and he said he was around but had a concert with a friend at 9pm sat so couldn't crash but is free any day. I asked about the following Sat for crashing and said it would be a lot easier for me, and he said hed have to let me know. He asked about Sunday, I said id have to let him know. He said K c ya and hung up. No pleasantries during the call/no chatting. I wrote next day (sunday afternoon) saying I woke up sick and to please do following sat without need to crash or whenever he's in town but that i loved hearing his voice. No response. Now its almost a week.

I would have made more efforts but I felt slightly conflicted about all this effort for someone who didn't call me until after our last date until 4 days after for the next date (altho it was for a place i mentioned wanting to go, which is sweet). It made me feel insecure slash like he was punishing me for not having sex.

He's very smooth/eligible busy guy so I feel like he found someone else it would be easier with and he could go faster with and who is always willing to go to his neighborhood (he wants to go where wed have access to an apartment/privacy as he ‚Äúisn‚Äôt in middle school‚Äù so everythings near him). but i still care a lot and feel bad baout how it ended.

1. Call and ask if he's around for something quick this weekend (this weekend would be hard though since I couldn't leave until Saturday to the city rather than Friday, and I have exams next week.
2. I will def be in the city the folliwing weekend, so wait and don't reach out until next week and ask to meet then and let him cool down for another week.
3. Call now and ask about next weekend
4. Send him a playlist of songs
5. Send apology/ Call and explain that the issues were that I was out of town but that I will be in town more in May and June and July and hope we can reconnect then. Issue is he thinks i say ""Sorry"" too much and finds it annoying.
6. Send a fun message such as ""so will i get to kiss your lips soon or not""","My honest opinion, take it for what it's worth.  Not trying to be mean here so sorry if it comes off this way.

You are 30 years old.  You can do whatever you want, date anyone you want, have the relationships you want.  If you are interested in this guy you need to prioritize him - full stop.  If he asks you out you need to make an effort to make it work.  Don't wait days to respond.  Don't get all flakey.  Don't say maybe maybe maybe and reschedule for whatever reason.  Give him a yes or a no and go through with it.

You can do whatever you want.  You can move at whatever pace you want.  But you need to put effort and energy into getting that.  You need to tell this guy 'Yes I like you but I want to take things slow'.  Does that work for him?  Maybe not.  Maybe he'll leave.  But if that's the case then he wasn't the guy for you anyway.

It sounds to me like you are trying to have it both ways - you like him and want to see him but you also are constantly giving mixed signals, either because you don't really like him or are trying to soften the blow for it/when he leaves.  That will get you nothing but unhappiness.

Figure out what it is you want and then go get it."

datingoverthirty,12e09dj,1680820005.0,Dating as a heterosexual gender nonconforming person?,"It seems to me that most dating advice I ever read boils down to ""epitomise your gender role and look for a partner who epitomises theirs"", and honestly that's not for everyone. I'm not a very feminine woman and I'm not attracted to very manly men; it's completely unhelpful to me to get told, essentially, that I'm fundamentally unattractive and with shit tastes in men too, for diverging a bit from the norm.

I'd like to know how other people who are not very gender-typical have managed to improve their dating prospects. It still seems like a dating niche in many respects and you have to accept that your appeal won't be as broad (and that's okay, because you wouldn't want someone who can't accept you for you), but damn if it doesn't seem like I'm playing the game on a higher difficulty setting.

Do you need to expend particular effort to find like-minded people?

Is OLD a must for connecting you to people you might not otherwise find? For having a profile where you can loudly advertise how you're like and what you're looking for?

Do you need to be part of certain scenes or to go to LGBTQ+ events?

If you don't look visibly queer or alt, does it often happen to run into traditional-minded folks who expect someone gender-conforming, and sooner or later express their disapproval of your gender expression?

If you're attracted to gender nonconforming people of the opposite sex, do you find that everyone seems to be trying to optimise for a bunch of gendered expectations that you don't care much about, and being insecure about the parts of themselves that you *do* like?

I'd be especially interested in the answers of people who don't have a very obviously genderqueer style or appearance, and it's something manifesting more in personality or preferences, things you don't discover until you get to know the person ‚Äî because I guess capital-Q Queer style can act as a built-in filter for dating only the sort of people who'd be down with that, whereas for the rest of us who visually blend in with gender-conforming people, it may be a common experience to be stereotyped as something you're not, or liked, initially, for something you're not, and I'd like to hear about any such stories.

Edit: I can't for the life of me understand what was so controversial about this post, especially since everyone who commented was nice and helpful. I don't see anything egregiously wrong with what I've asked. So until someone can explain, I'm going to assume bigotry.","I can really relate to this. I've never been fond of traditional femininity but have always identified and presented as a hetero woman.

I think not being particularly feminine can be a great filter actually. I've primarily dated on dating apps and it's clear that most gender conforming men don't match with me, which is *great* because our values are misaligned anyway. I think defying gender norms can actually help you sift through bullshit and incompatibilities early.

I just try to be very honest with who I am (e.g., what I'm interested in, what I do/don't value, what I do/don't like). I also make a point to wear and style myself how I do day-to-day rather than a fancier or more feminine version of myself that doesn't really reflect me. 

Do I have a lot of luck? Yes and no. Yes because my current 8 month relationship and the few relationships I had prior are/were healthy ones where my partner appreciates and respects me for me. No because I (34f) was single for 6 years prior to my current relationship because I couldn't find anyone compatible."

I‚Äôm trying to understand it from the point of view of someone who may have had such experiences before or as people who have bfs/gfs, who are still in touch with such exes as friends or people in their lives /anyone who has such friendship connections after exploring but failing at a romantic connection. Could anyone share some experiences on this?

I‚Äôm posting this because I shared this to one of my closest friends and my friend thinks I‚Äôm borderline psychotic for wanting to be friends with someone who broke my heart but is still wanting to be friends with me as we had a very deep emotional connect. And I have no issues with it since I‚Äôm over that but I‚Äôm also trying to understand the reasoning behind thinking why this is an issue. 

I see no reason why you can‚Äôt be good friends with your ex or someone who rejected you if you‚Äôve both been over it. 

I‚Äôm very good friends with two guys I dated in the past. But we decided to stay friends cause of no romantic connection/other long distance reasoning.

Edit - one is an ex who I‚Äôve known for a year :) broken up for almost 3/4 months 
Bumped into each other at a social event and we wanted to be on good terms. We broke up on good terms mutually though clearly i wanted that relationship . I agree that I cannot be close to him as I see communication lacks on his part and I won‚Äôt be putting an effort to maintain anything. 
May go stale and will be an occasional catch up but we spoke about staying on good terms. I also feel nothing for him and was completely over two months in. 

Another is another guy (met him outside of an app in real life) who I thought we got along very well in terms of communication and emotional connect. 
And we hadn‚Äôt progressed over the friendship stage though clearly he showed a lot of interest and flirted and led me on (I grew to think of him more than a friend at some point) and then decided later that we lacked chemistry. I‚Äôve given myself enough space from both of them. The latter and I thought we could be good friends cause of similar interests/hobbies/ great communication and decided to reconnect too after giving the space we both needed. 
I think we could be great friends and is why I see no reason why it‚Äôs not possible even tho I got invested for a little while. But there was no intimacy etc so I don‚Äôt know why my friend thinks otherwise. Was hell bent on the thought that I could never be friends with them both even if I wanted to. 
And I‚Äôve clearly moved on from both of them :)",I cut off people who broke my heart - mostly because a small part of me would hope there‚Äôs a chance‚Ä¶
datingoverthirty,12dqdp1,1680800107.0,Dating Overseas & Figuring Out Long-Term Plans,"A young woman [25F] messaged me [34M] regarding a personal ad I posted on r/r4r. We've been talking daily for two months and have video calls 2-4/week where we get lost in conversation, banter, and laughter for hours on end.

We have the same taste in music, humor/comedy, political views, life goals, views on relationships and children, and so much more.  I have never bonded with anyone else in my life so quickly. I have no doubts that I've found my person.

In our conversations, we have created a safe place that is healthy, encouraging, supportive and mature (and also quite silly and uplifting, too). I feel at home talking with her.

The drawback: she lives in the EU, and I'm in the US.

Ironically, I had been planning a trip to her home country this summer before we'd met. She is now helping me plan the trip and will be joining me for the entire two week vacation (with backup plan in case she feels unsafe or no connection in-person).

We've both gotten past the incredulous phase of ""Is this real?"" or ""Are they authentic?"" and have had the discussion on a relationship, but we're both unsure of what that looks like due to the distance.

She works remotely for a US-based company. That could open the door to her staying in the US for a bit, but she's a contractor with no long-term asssurances or benefits in the forseeable future. She also wants to attend grad school, which is 2-3x cheaper in the EU. She also doesn't plan on staying in her home country beyond this year, as she wants a change of scenery in another country. 

I won't ask her to give up on her career or education aspirations to move here. That's not fair. I can't yet move there if she's planning on living in another EU country, so I'm thinking about a year ahead if things continue to go well.

I've not seriously considered moving abroad until now, and, when I think about it honestly, I'm growing jaded with America - its politics and division, its cost of living and disregard for the working citizens, and the toxic and shallow dating culture here.

However, I've got a great career here and a healthy friend circle for the first time in my life. I might be able to work remotely from the EU short-term, but I'm looking into more permanent solutions.

I don't want to throw caution to the wind (I'm a planner). We still need to see if we have chemistry in-person, but I have no doubts on my end about that. I want to lean into this, but I'm not sure how.

If anyone had advice on LDRs, specifically with someone overseas, I'd appreciate your insight and direction.

EDIT: I've been in a LDR previously and know they're very difficult. I'm not looking for this to last long-term at this great of a distance.","Maybe just wait until you meet? Then decide how you want to move forward.

For my case, after we met, we realized we had couple of hurdles before we can realize the future we want. But it was hard to say no and let go because the chemistry was good, and it‚Äôs been a while since we both felt something for someone. I proposed to break down the relationship into smaller milestones because imagining the long term was daunting. So now our next milestone is our upcoming trip, then discuss again by then. In the mean time we‚Äôre getting to know each other further. 

Good luck!"

datingoverthirty,12d2sdo,1680739635.0,Where do you feel you get the best objective relationship advice?,"Honestly I sometimes really struggle to find someone who I feel will give me unbiased relationship advice. When it comes to reddit I feel there is an inherent negative slant towards relationship issues, probably because we are here on dating subreddits due to still being single and likely having experienced some heartbreak, but also millennial culture is quite heavily tilted in favour of independence/freedom over all else so if you're not feeling great about something, ditch it and be ""free"". In general, advice online seems to be very polarised towards ""break up with him/her"" and  ""that's a red flag"" imo.

When asking friends I feel like people are more in their head about moral absolutes than they are nuance, as in they tend to say what they think ""sounds right"" rather than what they would actually do in your position.

Personally I feel my parents are quite objective however being in their lates 60s they are so far removed from the modern dating world that I feel they struggle to understand really what it is like, as best they try, and they do try.

So that really just leaves professional counsellors etc who I have not really consulted for matters regarding dating before.

What works best for you?",">  inherent negative slant

Tell me about it.  I suggested to someone the other day if they weren't comfortable multi-dating, they should just ask for exclusiveness up front.  Immediately I get a ton of responses, ""It's unreasonable to ask for exclusiveness that early!""  Meanwhile I told my girlfriend -before- our first date that I don't date around and if things work out I want to go exclusive right away.  She was on board with it and we've been together a year now. In fact, I've never had a problem suggesting we go exclusive right away with any woman I've dated.

Anyways.

Reddit is okay if you know how to use it.  Look for anecdotes.  Read what worked for people, what didn't work.  That's typically much more helpful.  It's easy to give advice, much harder to pull from a personal experience to give weight to that advice.  I once asked a community if it was cool if my son wrote ""I love you"" on a birthday card to another girl in his class.  The best responses were all the people who commented that their kid had done the same and it was fine.

As for family/friends?  Mine make for a good sounding board.

datingoverthirty,12d0ycc,1680735446.0,"When you‚Äôre seeing multiple people, when do you narrow it down to one?","Hey y‚Äôall, I‚Äôm just curious. For those of you who multidate, when you have two or more people you‚Äôre interested in, when do you, personally, decide to cut things off with one?

I‚Äôm trying some new OLD dating strategies and a big part of that is dating multiple people. As in, not pausing or turning off my profile once I match with one person and playing that out until it fizzles or whatever. Lots of fizzling goes on, haha. 

So, where I am now is I‚Äôm talking/dating two people. No talk of exclusivity, we‚Äôve been chatting/texting/talking and have been on one date with each. Right now, for now, I think both are great. They have some similarities and differences and as things are I can see potential for continuing to see both. One, D, has more schedule flexibility, is more communicative, and very sweet. My concerns are that at least one of our approaches to life doesn‚Äôt really match up/yellow flag, very different backgrounds, and he seems super eager. The super eagerness has never served me well. Otherwise we get along super well. The other,A, I have a lot in common with being from the same area. We get along great. He has follow through, is communicative, and very  thoughtful as well. The only concerns I have are that he seems pretty brutal in cutting people he has known for years out of his life for what seems to me to be simple things, and his schedule is pretty restrictive. Only really available weekends. With that my concern is if things progress and we want to spend more time together it would be extremely difficult. Otherwise they both really tick all of the same boxes. 

So, I‚Äôm just thinking ahead because the day may come if they both don‚Äôt break things off with me first, how/when do I choose? 

How do you typically handle this? Do you wait until one opens up the topic of exclusivity? Definitely prior to or immediately after sex with one for me. Do you just wait until one relationship gets more developed? Wait for a red flag to pop up? 
 
I‚Äôm in uncharted waters and definitely will do what feels right for me, but I would love you hear your feedback.",Last one to leave is my gf
datingoverthirty,12c8vkn,1680670438.0,Unmatch or nah?,"***Edit: 

I decided to respond with my availability. I‚Äôm still feeling meh about it, but at least I‚Äôll have given it a shot. I am trying to be more open-minded. I usually don‚Äôt even respond to such generic opening ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up‚Äù messages. I only overlooked that due to the guy‚Äôs profile. 

Me, 36F. 
I matched with a guy (late 30sM) on Tinder. He sent me a generic ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up for the weekend‚Äù message on Saturday. I responded with what I considered a thoughtful, well-written bit. 

He thought it was too. Enough that it stunned him into silence. I had no response from him until earlier tonight, three days later. He apologized for not responding sooner, and said my message was the most thoughtful one he‚Äôd ever seen on the app. He then asked me for my availability this week for a drink, and apologized again. 

I am on the fence about whether to just unmatch, accept a date and see how it goes, or tell him no and explain why, then unmatch. 

I‚Äôm currently leaning to the side that says if he is this shocked by a single well-written message, I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôd be able to handle me in person and would probably ditch me out of insecurity. 

I thought I‚Äôd ask if any of y‚Äôall have experienced something like this before, and how it went for you.

Edit: 

I‚Äôm not going to write out the message in full but his wording definitely indicated he was surprised and he had to ‚Äúprocess it‚Äù. 

I‚Äôve just had a lot of experiences with people who have ended up ditching me due to their own insecurities and doubts despite being as interested as this guy seems to. So this is giving me a similar vibe that‚Äôs making me hesitate.",">I‚Äôm currently leaning to the side that says if he is this shocked by a single well-written message, I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôd be able to handle me in person and would probably ditch me out of insecurity.    

Huh?  Where are you getting that he was ""this shocked""??  You recently matched with a guy.  Lots of people take a few days to reply on dating apps when they first match.  Sounds like the dude was busy with other aspects of his life and wasn't that focused on some random woman he's never met.  He apologized, said he liked your response, and would like to see you.  Sounds perfectly normal to me."

New advice needed


I sent a text ending it after a werif argument this werkend. It was long, heartfelt but let him know I had to go. It wasn't his fault, he's wonderful, but it's too painful to stay. I needed to do it text. I had never told him I loved him, but I did in the break up text. My last line was ""I fell in love with you and I'm sorry"". 

He wrote back ""Can we sleep on this for a day or two?"" 

I said ok. 

We haven't spoken for 3 days. I've heard nothing. 

I wanted to give him the respect of time to respond if he needed it, but now I feel so hurt. Like I didn't matter. I would have rather had him say nothing back at all. This is the first weekend we haven't spent together in a year and a half. 

What do I do? Write a polite text asking if he had anything to say? Just leave it and block him on everything?

I mean obviously he didn't panic and fight for me in the moment or over the last 3 days so why not just message me to close it? 

""I'm sorry things turned out this way I'm glad I met you..."" or something. But at this point I'm just sitting here feeling worthless, unvalued, confused and like... what do I do?

‚Äê‚Äê----------------------------------------------

ORIGINAL POST

I am. I don't even know how to type this. My mind is cluttered. I know the answer but I I'm scared and sad.  

Here's the gist - I can give more detail but I'm gonna try and keep this short. 

Met someone online 1.5 years ago.  Spent every single weekend together (days on end, again for the last 1.5 years). I have kids, if that explains weekends. We also have spent days during the week together for like holidays, valentines, birthdays etc. I've spent hours with his family whenever they visit, his family from his home state knows about me. I'm friends with all of his friends here - like we text on a personal level. I text his mom. He isn't originally from my state. 

I'm a single mother. In the beginning I wasn't sure about a relationship but I let him know I wanted to see how things developed... and they did as you can see. I checked back in multiple times that things were going well. All I had ever read was ""actions must match words"" and they always did. We took turns reaching out. And it was all the time. I have a toothbrush head at his house, he spent all his free time with me. When I asked if he was dating other people ""why would I date others? I'm not interested in others I'm dating you"". 

Now I'm not young. I have been through many long term relationships. I have been used. I have been married. The reason I was so hesitant with him in the beginning is because I was actively trying to change habits that had lead to bad relationships in my past. I was going through this man with a fine tooth comb, and he has been amazing. Respectful. Consistent. Always follows through. Sends me messages after EVERY hang out about how enjoyed his time with me, appreciates me, etc. He plans dates, vacations, whatever. Of course I thought I should eventually bring up the bf/gf talk but when we are both in our 30s it felt... juvenile? Like this dude is showing effort and consistency, told me on multiple occasions he's not seeing anyone else, isn't that what I needed? I've already been married and had children, I'm not looking for someone to move in with in a hurry, or have kids or anything, but that doesn't mean I don't want a legit connection. I can get laid by a random, been there done that. But I developed a relationship with this person. He knows it. Can you spend all your free time with someone, have them meet your family, spend holidays together, go on vacation, and not expect a connection to be formed? If you want casual keep it casual. Don't spend hours on hours sitting in your car and talking with this person day after day after day. I grew closer to him in this time than in my marriage. I have opened up to him in ways I never opened up to anyone. I didn't realize you could spend hours upon hours just talking and having someone care enough to listen. And it wasn't just me that did the talking, if anything I've done most of the listening.

So a few weeks ago I realized he was still active on bumble. I knew but said nothing. He eventually opens up to me about how he's freaked out about attached we've gotten. How he is probably going to have to go back to his home state (this is something I've been aware of, but yet he also waffles about talking about his 5 year plan here). He states he needs to be able to see other people because if we continue down this path its just ""going to really fucking hurt"" which he keeps repeating in a panicked state. Hurt who? I'm already hurting... so I'm thinking he's breaking up. I calm said that I was disappointed this was going to be the last time we will see eachother and he starts panicking - starts asking me to wait and think about it, I told him I thought he was breaking up.  He panicks again and tells me I'm his best friend, that this isn't him trying to break up. He has no intentions of things changing between us. I then tell him my boundaries and he agrees. We have now had this same discussion 3 times, it would be easier if I stepped aside. Each time he tells me how this isn't what this is about.

He has since held true to his word, things haven't changed between us, but 3 different times I've told him this isn't fair to him. I take up all his free days and I'm not comfortable being ""demoted"". But I find my mind goes crazy every week we aren't together. I thought I could be cool. But I'm not. I hold things in. The weekends we spend together I'm insecure, but I don't let him know. I know he talks to other girls, and I know he's met up with them.

If this was a friend I'd tell her to bail. For my own emotions I know I should bail. This isn't my first rodeo. I know this is killing me. I just don't understand. Why take it this far? Why not let me walk away when it makes it easier for you? Did he never have feelings at all? How do you fake it for that long? I feel like if I walk away I'll be devastated. If I stay I'm devastated. Of course I know he just wants his cake and to eat it too but why when you already have another slice of cake? What do I mean to you? What did I mean to you? What was the last year and half all about? If you're just over it let me walk. 

I realize this wasn't short at all. I appreciate anyone that's read this. Please be gentle, I'm very raw. There is more to this story but it's the gist. I'm once again feeling not fucking good enough, like a void filler. Like I'm decent enough to fill the time but no one's first choice. And yes I've been to therapy for years. I know the appropriate answers but it doesn't change the feeling if that makes sense...

If im honest with myself I love this person. It happened, I fell. I know the best answer, and probably the most probable answer I'm going to hear is LEAVE. But I'm struggling so hard. I just can't. I know it's what I should do, but why am I struggling so bad? I don't want this person to be a stranger. Its killing me. I have to make a choice between pain and pain. I don't even want to move. I don't understand how I got here after trying so hard to make intentional change. I feel stupid and pathetic. I should know better. This has robbed me of the ability to trust myself or my choices. I dunno. I dunno what I want to heat or expect to hear... that I'm not alone I guess? Not stupid? Some beautiful formation of words to tell him that let's him know my level of hurt without seeming dramatic ? Thank for listening.",Take it as a no and move on. He is still in Bumble. He is not sure with what he wants but is afraid to lose you. You are right with setting your boundary.
datingoverthirty,12avfw9,1680551097.0,How do you handle rejecting someone,"Hi! 

I‚Äôve been dating someone I met on hinge for about 6 months now, I‚Äôm not the most direct and new to the country I‚Äôm in so certain things I‚Äôve noticed from the girl I‚Äôm dating that I would have classed as a red flag or given me means to end things in the past I‚Äôve ignored. It‚Äôs gotten to 6 months now and it‚Äôs clear I don‚Äôt want to be with her long term, I tried to communicate it to her over text but it didn‚Äôt really land well. She‚Äôs now told me she see‚Äôs a future with me but isn‚Äôt ready to settle for 3-5 years, even if I did see a future with her I‚Äôd want to settle sooner. I know it‚Äôs foolish of me to think I can get out of this relationship without hurting her feelings but I just don‚Äôt know the best way to end it. Looking for any guidance or support from my Reddit Fam!

Edit: So I tried to talk to her f2f as I agree I wanna do this right, I was polite and respectful- so was she surprisingly. But I was afraid would happen happened- she agreed I need to see where my future would go with her but she enjoys spending time with me and sees a future so doesn‚Äôt want me to make any relationship decisions until I get back from home (visiting my folks for 2 weeks) to which I agreed. I feel like a huge douche because I know my answer won‚Äôt change in 2 weeks- maybe texting is the right thing to make it clear then a conversation when I‚Äôm back?!","Feelings will be hurt either way. At 6 months I would hope that the other person would have the courtesy to call/in-person have a discussion with me.

For me it helps to write down what I'm planning to say and tell myself no matter what happens I need to stick with it. You're unable to predict how she's going to react. You can only control your behavior and making sure to do it respectfully."
datingoverthirty,12ao6wp,1680536422.0,How to politely request some man-scaping,"Hey folks! I'm finally back in the dating game and I''d love some recommendations on how to kindly request for some man-scaping from this guy I just started seeing.

We've been on 4 dates, and I his face is very well groomed.. I incorrectly assumed that trend would apply everywhere. I was very wrong. I feel like a dick for even thinking this, but the first time we were intimate, I felt like Indiana Jones trying to navigate a jungle..

I'm guessing this is due to lack of experience (there were other indicators that the poor guy didn't know his way around in that space). How do I kindly state that I will not be going south of the border unless the hedges have been trimmed up? 

Is a, ""I really enjoy going down on you, but I could get into it more if you did some man-scaping"" adequate?","Start with, ""Can I make a potentially awkward request?"" 

Follow with a compliment sandwich, e.g.

""I like doing stuff with your junk,

but I could do more and better if you do some manscaping,

which I'm mentioning because I'm excited to do it again.""

Just one man's opinion."

So, I went on the trip. He showed up at the airport to pick me up. We went to one of my favorite restaurants for dinner. Went back to the hotel where both of us are sharing a room, played a game of *we‚Äòre not really strangers* and talked about our predicament. With us ending the conversation with him going to another country to try and sort out his visa and then we will see where to from there. 

Today, I woke up to explore alone as he needed time to sort out his documents and I  wanted to give him space.

Anyways, I come back and he was waiting for us to have dinner together before going out to hang with ‚Äûfriends‚Äú he met last week.

Before he goes he gives me a password to his PC so I can watch some Netflix shows. I didn‚Äôt watch anything right away, I was on Instagram but the PC kept getting notifications. I decided to look and noticed that he had forgotten to logout of a messaging app.

As I was about to close the lid of the PC to go back to browsing my Instagram. He gets another notification that reads ‚ÄûI am really horny right now‚Äú. So then I went down the rabbit hole of reading the whole conversation.

He had matched with a girl on bumble, had slept with her and her friend and Organised a 3 some with both of them. Took videos of them during these encounters.

Given that I have this person for less than a month, we weren‚Äôt exclusive and I hadn‚Äôt slept with him yet. I am not hurt that he was seeing and slept with other people but feel extremely disrespected.

I feel disrespected because he knew I was coming here to see him. He left me in his hotel to go sleep with someone else. 

He did all this while telling me how excited he was to see me. How he couldn‚Äôt wait for us to be together again.

I am now packing my things to go find my own hotel but I don‚Äôt know how to deal with this. Do I ghost? Do I address it?

I am also sure he knows I know because he used his phone to logout and immediately sent me a message to ask me how my Netflix shows were going.

Edit: people wondering how I know that he was off to meet someone to sleep with. 

1. He was logged into a messaging app. So, the messages he was receiving were real-time. They were not old texts but messages he was receiving in that moment and I, of cause, read their whole conversation from the beginning. They met on bumble and had sex sometime during the week, took videos of their sexual encounter and sent it to another girl whom they wanted to have a 3 sum with. He also had sex with the second girl on a different occasion and also took videos of it.

UPDATE: I didn‚Äôt leave a note or anything, I don‚Äôt care if he is worried about my safety etc. I simply packed my bags and left and that‚Äôs it. I know at least one person in the city we‚Äôre in. So I won‚Äôt be alone",I would walk out without a second thought. You are not exclusive but leaving you alone in a hotel when he goes off to shag someone else is taking the piss. Very disrespectful and a complete waste of your time.

datingoverthirty,128qjxf,1680364990.0,This feels like a real problem,"My two year relationship ended in mid-January. It was a traumatic end, and I‚Äôm not even close to over it. I‚Äôm well aware it‚Äôs going to take time, a lot of processing, and a little self care and boundary setting.

But‚Ä¶I am missing sex and intimacy like crazy. My ex was, no question, the best sex of my life, and we had A LOT of sex.

This strikes me as the part you should reflect on a bit more. Every person is different and you know best whether having a casual fling will quell your sex drive or if it's an unproductive coping mechanism.

For me, I really want emotional intimacy more than the physical act of sex so casual flings don't cut it. However, that's not the case for everyone, so the challenge is really figuring out the best way forward for you! Guess and check is also a valid approach if you want to try out the casual thing.

But this is the opposite. It‚Äôs been seven dates in, and I‚Äôve been the one initiating all the first kisses and the cuddles.

I‚Äôve really liked taking our time, but at this point I‚Äôm starting to feel the physical chemistry is dropping off. Kissing has started to feel sort of‚Ä¶sexless? He seems to like making out a lot, but slowly, and I have to confess I‚Äôm not the type to be super excited about making out when it doesn‚Äôt seem to go anywhere. 

I tried to take off his shirt last night and he allowed it, but said he was going home soon after. I asked him how he felt about the pace of things, and he said he has really liked our pace and wants to wait until he stops feeling shy before having sex.

He mentions that a lot ‚Äî feeling shy around me.

I really connect with him mentally and emotionally, and feel sad that physically the chemistry seems to be slipping away. But at the same time I totally respect him wanting to take his time and want him to feel comfortable.

Advice? Has anyone been in this situation before? (Maybe he‚Äôs just not attracted to me?)","There could be a whole abundance of reasons. Has he been hurt, betrayed, humiliated, cheated on? I was pretty terrified of getting naked in front of my girlfriend the first time, it took us a while, and we are in a great place now sexually. But I had some trauma that I had to work through. If you connect so well it's really worth being patient and trying to talk. There's no harm in saying ""is there any reason you want to take it so slow? Anything worrying you or on your mind we can discuss?"" Something like that. And I know this sounds obvious, but we guys don't tend to get a lot of compliments....are you telling him you're attracted to him, that he's sexy etc? 

If things are as great as you've said I'd advise you to talk to him. But be prepared to be patient. It could be so worth it!"

And for those of you have trouble opening up how do you like people to respect that and not probe or just make you feel emotionally safe?
Thank you!

Edit: thank you all for the wonderful suggestions!!!","It's very simple. Be there for them and don't become a mental strain to them. Bring peace and silence when needed, and be ready to step up with care, activities and love when they ask you for help. 

Be prepared to back off if you see the person is too stressed and needs time alone. 

Don't overwhelm the person under stress with decision making questions. If you need an issue solved and the person is under stress, take the decisions yourself, plan a talk for later, or wait. 

Be patient to listen to them. If you can chip in with opinions and advice, do it.

You can also help by bringing some structure into their life that helps them distract themselves from work: weekend plans or routines, fun activities after work. Maybe make yourself someone they look forward to when they want to disconnect from work."

datingoverthirty,126lwcu,1680180347.0,Do I end this or do I let nature take its course? Do I even go on this trip?,"*huge sigh*

3 weeks ago I met perhaps one of the most wonderful and realest people out there. We are/were still getting to know each other so I don‚Äôt know him at his worst‚Ä¶ maybe.

Both of us are expats, we met in a club. I get approached by men a lot in clubs but there was something about him that just hit differently. So I decided to give it a chance despite having promised myself to take a break from dating.

Anyways last week he left to go to a nearby country to sort out his visa for the country we are both in which was expiring on March 25th. We had planned to meet there on Saturday April 1st then come back together on the 4th and celebrate my birthday which is on the 6th. It was all perfect.

However, yesterday he found out his visa wasn‚Äôt granted and that he would have to wait 3 months before applying again. Which means he can‚Äôt come back here on a long term visa.  It‚Äôs been a tough two days of me trying to be there for him and him stressing about what to do about the situation as his whole life is in this country.

However, it‚Äôs become clear to me that this also means the end of us. I am leaving the country in august, we knew this from the beginning but wanted to see how things would be between us in the meantime. 

If I was staying here longer, I wouldn‚Äôt mind keeping things going some way until we meet again but right now that doesn‚Äôt feel feasible. Although I am likely not going to date, I don‚Äôt want to hold on to hope that we will reunite.

I haven‚Äôt brought this up yet because everything is still fresh and I honestly haven‚Äôt had time to process my feelings because I have been focused on making sure he feels supported while also trying to give him space.

Now I‚Äôm left with a million question. To go on that trip or not? What if it make me even more sad when I come back without him? When is the right time to bring up the conversation about what happens with us if any at all? We weren‚Äôt official but were having much needed conversations about potentially being exclusive soon. I feel a bit numb at the moment because I have mostly focused on him and not me","It‚Äôs all a risk. Traveling abroad, meeting someone new, navigating changes: whether it‚Äôs a visa issue or new job offer, it‚Äôs all the same.

Live in the moment, and see where it takes you! Go with the flow, appreciate the time together, have fun 

Don‚Äôt break things off prematurely or make decisions based on: what if, personal anxieties, fears of leaving/being left, or preconceived or future emotions such as sadness

Tomorrow isn‚Äôt promised to any of us! It‚Äôs easier to take things for what they are now and make a giant barrier regarding future-inspired-reactions

I know it‚Äôs easier said than done, but it‚Äôs worth trying to make that effort in my opinion"

datingoverthirty,1268clj,1680142383.0,Not dressing up for OLD first dates/meet ups,"Okay, so, I‚Äôve got this idea‚Ä¶ please tell me it‚Äôs not ridiculous‚Ä¶ I have a feeling the feedback won‚Äôt be good though. Anyway, so I normally dress my best for first date meet ups to make a good impression. The problem is I‚Äôve found that it puts a ton of pressure on me moving forward to still go through the whole process for every meet up/date/hang out from then on. I have to be made up, dressed expertly, nails done, waxed plucked exfoliated and moisturized even for someone just coming over to watch a movie or go for a run. It‚Äôs exhausting and I end up feeling like I have to hide/conceal how I look on a day to day basis in order to keep up the facade. 

So, I‚Äôve been thinking about lowering the bar for myself. Dressing nicely and appropriately, but not carefully curating my ensemble. Being clean and putting effort into my look, but not doing my nails and fixing my brows specifically for that date. Looking nice with some every day make up and whatever hairstyle I wear daily instead of a full beat and a 4 step hair routine with a 2hr dry time that I will have to wash, detangle just to put back in a bun after the date. 

I want ppl I meet to like me how I look every day (on a good day not my worst days) and then I can jazz myself up really nice as things progress and if we start doing more involved dates. 

Please tell me I am not completely neurotic and that this makes sense and someone else does this too.

Eta: went on a date since posting this. I wore regular sneakers, attractive jeans (not my top tier boom boom pow jeans tho), and a t shirt and the same make up and hair I wear for work. Had a great time! Was comfortable and having him see me more laid back and still liking me was really validating. Now we just have to see if we get to the ‚Äúno make up‚Äù level. Lol. I will say though, I don‚Äôt wear make up when I‚Äôm alone or running errands but if I‚Äôm going to work or meeting up with my friends I always wear a lil something. I think the no make up look might come closer to if we are ever intimate bc I have yet to find one that doesn‚Äôt transfer no matter how much primer, baking, setting spray or powder I apply. So that would just be for logistics. Lol","You don't know if you'll even like this person! Don't stress yourself out so much. 

I got used to the covid dates of just walking at a local park and wearing athletic attire. I think it is a good low pressure first meet up and you can wear something comfortable. 

Only dress up if you enjoy it."
datingoverthirty,1264xic,1680133647.0,Dating 2 women for a single LTR relationship,"I am a very late bloomer, as I age, it seems I have more success in dating. I have never had the struggle to date multiple women, I always had a single exclusive date as I never look for matches while I date someone I like. But now, I had my first such problem, and I wonder what are my options... important thing is, I do not want to be a shitty person to anyone or play games, but I want to maximize my happiness with ONE girl, and not zero or two. Both girls are looking for someone long term and myself too.

I have matched Girl1 a month ago, we chatted almost daily, great humor, great conversations about anything, very chatty, flirty, interested in me. We had our first date Sunday as we both were super busy (vibe check, walk in the park, coffee), I asked a second date and had it Thursday (beers and dinner). I kissed her at the end and we hugged in the outside cold for a minute. Nothing else happened.

I have matched Girl2 4 days ago, she did not like to chat, so we scheduled a date on Wednesday (coffee). She is super sweet, communicative, interested in me, compliments me (!), apologizes constantly because she is very busy and does not like chatting. I did not even held her hand, nor kissed her, she had to run to do her things. She gave me her phone number on the spot.

So now here comes the dilemma: Girl1 we have built quite a connection, I feel she likes me a lot and I liked her a lot up until Girl2 came along. Physically I like Girl2 much more, but we hardly built anything between us yet, so I do not know how she feels about me exactly (still a lot to share and discuss). Both are very early in the dating process. Neither of the women addressed exclusivity yet, in my opinion, that is around date 4-5, possibly after first (safe) sex. If anyone would, I would be honest.

What are your thoughts?",[deleted]
datingoverthirty,125wb4u,1680114089.0,How long?,"Been seeing a lady now for a couple of months (third week of January).  We started talking in November via OLD and eventually phone (text) prior to meeting.  From a conversation last night, she still has us in the ‚Äúdating‚Äù phase and doesn‚Äôt view us as in a relationship.  She also says she hasn‚Äôt caught deep feelings yet.

I‚Äôve always been one that loves to easily, and it‚Äôs bitten me in the past (more than once), so I‚Äôve been a bit guarded, waiting to see what she does.  I‚Äôve told her that I‚Äôm ready to move to a relationship.  The feelings are there for me, but after last nights conversation, apparently not for her‚Ä¶

I can understand taking things slower, but at what point is it not worth pursuing as a relationship?

Edit:  changed the timeline a bit, and added the part about OLD since November, as suggested in some posts.  Also added that I‚Äôve expressed that I‚Äôm ready to be in a relationship.","If we don‚Äôt define anything in 2-3 months, I assume they‚Äôre not interested tbh. Is she attracted to you?

datingoverthirty,125akoo,1680057185.0,What is the best way to communicate change in what i'm looking for?,"Met a guy in person (28M) and his initial actions made it seem like he was interested in a relationship, and he implied this, I even said I don't do strictly casual, but a few dates in he mentioned how relationship was a low priority for him but that we're going on dates, he wants emotional connection. + fun and he really likes me and that its not strictly casual. It was hard to fully discuss this as the conversations usually ended up being at end of dates after he was paying for my transportation home, as we were both traveling for weeks at a time and he doesn't like to text. I felt if I established a boundary like that then, he'd just not contact me again.

However, the last few times we met up it was clear he pretty often hooks up with people, is into hookups/treated me like that when he tried to encourage me to this arrangement / sleep with me even though we haven't hooked up yet, isn‚Äôt going to invite me to group hangs or introduce me to anyone, and wasn't going to change his communication habits between dates like he originally promised. He said 5th date (met 3 months ago but lots of time was spent in different cities between each dates) was slow to not hookup etc. I told him I just needed time since I've never done that before but that I really like him. Now I'm realizing I don't want to have something casual. I don't think I want to jump into a relationship either - I guess I want to explore a connection where relationship/normal regular communication/integrating into each others lives is not off the table. I do really like him, so I would want to date him..

He's contacted me since our last date to schedule another one, but I'm out of town and then he's going out of town. No contact/response since i said i couldn't make it on the weekend. So this might be needless.

Would it be best to discuss in person after having a really good date (some awkward stuff related to this went down last time)? Or a phone call? Or a text before making plans again? I also don't wanna end it bc I like him, but I also don't wanna seem clingy since I think that would just turn him off further.

If he reaches out, I guess I can say something like the following, but would appreciate advice/feedback on which like of the below would be best: 

""Hey, before making plans, -- you know I like you a lot, but sadly I realized I am looking for something with potential to evolve into something a little more substantial and less casual//but realized actively pursuing something knowing it will only lead to casual at outset is not for me// /looking for short-term relationship, bc even non-exclusive, i prefer that over casual."" 100% understand thats not where you're at. If where I'm at changes, i know I will love to hit you up, but right now that's where I'm at and where I realized my hesitancy was coming from. XX, take care"" or ""ugh... so I realized i'm looking to date men for real and don't want a fwb. sucks but it is what it is. maybe catch you at a \[event we met at\] sometime <3""

All his texts are <handful of words bc he hates texting, like he will purposely not use prepositions just to make it shorter, so i feel awkward sending such a long text. Any way to make it a little more 'cool' so I feel less self-conscious or a burden to him?

The caveat to all this is he's the only person I have truly fallen for post my 7 year relationship, and he reminds me a lot of my ex, and It's super hard to let this go, so i do still wanna see him and not sure if ending this is the right move as i'm otherwise just thinking of ex :(

It just kills me to know he probably won't even reply or will just thumbs up react...","You know what‚Äôs cool? Being yourself. Don‚Äôt try to tailor your communication to try to impress someone

datingoverthirty,125efle,1680068538.0,Dating someone with a chronic illness,"Apologies, this is long. I'll try to do a TLDR (although I don't know why people bother with this sub unless they're looking for tea). 

I (37F) have been seeing someone (40M) for about a month. He's sweet, thoughtful, funny, we have a lot of the same interests. He's been genuinely interested in getting to know me. I have been trying to take things slow, but we both really like each other. We've gone out about 10 times, he's slept over a couple times. I find him very attractive and the sex is excellent. Very respectful about asking about boundaries and honoring them. I have not wanted to use the word girlfriend/boyfriend yet, for a few reasons. We are exclusive and are both interested in moving toward more

He laid out his baggage on our first date. A lot of it is normal stuff for adults in this phase of their life. I think he's probably experienced some rejection and wanted to get it out in the open. One of them is a chronic illness he's had for two decades. I think I would normally be more comfortable with that, except he doesn't manage it well. He's had several incidents in the past few years that could have been prevented if he didn't blatantly ignore advice from his doctor. He's said that it's partially psychological, and he struggles when he feels he's being judged or controlled. 

He had a health setback while he was with me this weekend. He asked me to take him to urgent care and just leave him there. I wasn't comfortable with that, and wanted to be sure he was ok. They did a bunch of tests and the care team was really rude to him. They were outwardly judging him because they could tell he was not managing his illness to their expectations. It was scary to see him in an active health crisis. At one point he told me that he was scared that he was going to die.

During the time I was there he kept absolving me of any responsibility, and kept saying that it would be fine if I left. He was annoyed when staff would ask who I was in relation to him. I stayed for probably two hours, and he didn't really talk to me while we were there. He was sick, in pain, and uncomfortable. I try not to judge him for the way he handled what is a very difficult and scary experience. I tried not to hover or ask questions and just be supportive and helpful. But him being annoyed and withdrawn from me was a side of him I hadn't seen. 

When I decided to leave, because he was being admitted, he asked if he should call me again when he gets out of the hospital. I was a little taken aback by the implication that we might be over? He was all in four hours prior. But the incident did trigger some of my issues with trust and abandonment. I felt very scared and alone watching him struggle. I questioned what our future would look like. I feel like shitty person for it, though. I could get hit by a bus tomorrow and be in a worse position. I really like him, but I'm not sure about this hurdle.

TLDR - struggling to support a new relationship with a partner who does not manage their chronic illness well.

Edit to add an update - he called yesterday and left me a message today, and we texted a little bit today. He is still in the hospital, not sure when he's going to get out. He sounds pretty rough. He said I might be able to go visit him tomorrow. Just trying to be supportive and offer to bring him things or visit him if he needs or wants. It's just been scary for both of us. Trying to treat this as something to be aware of, but not necessarily a deal breaker. A conversation definitely needs to happen when he's feeling better. I really appreciate everyone who took the time to provide details on their personal experiences and thoughtful comments.","In my experience, it‚Äôs hard to be with someone who doesn‚Äôt take ownership of their own healthcare decisions. I was with an ex for two years who struggled with depression but was very resistant to getting help. It ended up getting to a point where I‚Äôd nag him to remember to pick up his meds because he‚Äôd frequently not do it and then spiral into a scary place. He refused therapy, despite his psychiatrist‚Äôs advice. He‚Äôd get angry that I was nagging and I‚Äôd get angry that I had to take care of him. I ultimately felt like I was his mom/nurse/therapist, not his girlfriend and it bred resentment. 

Your guy seems to already be putting you in a caregiver role, whether he intends to or not, by not taking ownership of his own health. This would be a problem for me. 

I don‚Äôt think a chronic illness alone is necessarily an issue as long as it‚Äôs well managed and the person takes responsibility for getting treatment. I have an autoimmune disease myself, and while it can be annoying, I visit the doctor regularly, take my pills every day, and do what I need to do to keep going."

datingoverthirty,12598sk,1680053728.0,What milestones do you want to see before you introduce kids to each other?,"I see a lot of time based reccondations, but we are moving way faster than the typical couple. We recognize it and are ok with it. I know every couple says it, but we are perfect in so many ways and don't have to give up a part of ourselves to be a couple. 

It makes me think there needs to be milestone achievements to mark when is the right time to introduce kids rather than a timeliness. Bit I draw an absolute blank when I try to think of any.","The reason we use time recommendations is because there's simply too many variables involved to ever give a good rule of thumb for anything else.  The age of the kids, your emotional availability, how much they know about your relationship, your life situation, your co-parenting schedule, and so on and so on and so on.  The whole 'six month' thing is just a general catch all because by that point almost everything should sort of be in alignment no matter what your situation is.

The most important advice I can give though is do -not- rush it just because you think it will make your dating life more convenient.  You might be a perfect couple but to your kids this is a total stranger.  They may need time to adjust first.  Psych them up a bit first.  Start talking about your partner, about your dates, get them interested/curious.  Your kids love you (in theory) so they'll naturally be interested in your life.

My girlfriend and I went pretty quick too, but even though I knew I was in love with her at first sight, I still spent about ~4 months talking about her with my boys.  You wouldn't think an 8 and 10 year old would give a hoot about the romantic aspirations of their dad but when I finally did bring my gf over to meet them, my younger son drew her a ton of pictures and my older boy had combed his hair and put on deodorant to try to make a good first impression.

Hi everybody, I need a bit of a reality check here. Sorry about the length. My brain is too tired to edit it down. If you stick it out to the end, thank you!

&#x200B;

I'm a late bloomer, haven't dated a ton due to some traumatic childhood experiences and a tendency to avoid dating in favour of career development. I'm now 47F, and after three years of therapy, am feeling ready to start dating again. It's going a lot better than it ever did when I was younger, but I'm finding myself a bit confused with a man I'm in the chatting with/getting to know each other phase. We met on bumble.

&#x200B;

He comes on really strong. Basically, telling me he wants me to be his girlfriend. We've video chatted a couple of times and spoken on the phone or texted every day but I don't let myself have strong feelings for people I haven't yet met in person (I live in a remote community so we aren't meeting until April). I had to ask him to pull back the sex talk and pictures a bit, and his reaction was to basically take sex off the table for when we meet, and no more sex talk from him, which is actually fine by me - but he hasn't been able to stick to that and it's pretty clear that he's hoping we have sex when we meet up. I haven't said we will - just that we will see how we feel when we meet.

&#x200B;

So I've been putting in some long, exhausting days at work this week, and when I'm done work, I need to shut my brain off. It's not usually like this, but I'm finishing off a project that requires a lot of attention and field work and I'm just mentally done at the end of the day. The guy wanted to do a video call so I called him when I was off work. He was very sweet (and intense) but said I sounded distracted. I told him I was just tired from work and having trouble focusing but he suggested we talk later and I agreed. Then today on my lunch break, I had messages from him that it felt like I didn't want to talk and blew him off when he was looking forward to speaking with me. I apologized and explained my work brain issue this week and he just invalidated that and said I blew him off and he's kinda turned off. 

&#x200B;

Honestly, this just rubs me the wrong way. It feels like I'm not allowed to have off days and like I need to spend energy I'm not sure I have to make sure his feelings aren't hurt if I don't give him my full attention. I probably should have just not arranged to video call with him until this project is done, but I didn't.  And now I'm trying to figure out what my next move is, if anything. I've already apologized and explained what what going on for me, and I don't think I need to grovel. I don't feel like I did something so egregious that he's so instantly turned off. I'm wondering if this is normal? Most guys I've dated in the past have been pretty avoidant, so despite his intensity kind of freaking me out (younger me would have run for the hills), I've been reluctant to walk away because I'm trying to date men who are not like the men I usually dated. And other than the intensity, I do really like him, acknowledging that I don't really know him yet. I'm just thinking that this early into things, he's twice made me feel like I've messed up and it feels like he's chastising me for it because I'm apparently not living up to the image he's made of me in his head.

&#x200B;

I guess I'm hoping some of you have some experience and/or advice for me. Did I really fuck up here? Maybe I should post this in Am I the Asshole? lol",This is waaaaaay too much drama for someone you haven't even met yet.  Move on my friend.
datingoverthirty,1253362,1680039117.0,Looking for Advice for Online Dating,"Hi all! I've made a few posts from time to time, however, I'm looking to see what everyone thinks of my situation! I'm in my late 20s (almost 30) female. I got out of my last relationship last year and took a break before finally getting back into dating. I met my previous boyfriend organically, so when I began OLD in October of last year, it was completely different than what I had imagined (as it was my first time ever). I knew I wanted a LTR but realized how little I knew what I really wanted and didn't want (probably also due to the only one dating experience I had prior to this). Fast forward, I was on and off the apps the first 2-3 months of OLD as it got quite stressful. But OLD definitely taught me very well what I wanted and didn't want, how to draw boundaries, and what areas I had to improve on.

Now it's been over six months, I think I've improved a lot. I re-vamped my profile back in January & February to really tailor it towards what I want, who I am, and the fact I want a life partner. After meeting so many matches, I really know what I'd like which is to find the one who I can share a life with and possibly have a family with in the near future. I've also worked on myself a lot since January and focused on things I'd like to do. I definitely think I'm in a pretty good spot now with everything.

I don't have too much trouble matching on these apps, but more so, trouble with finding someone on the same page as me and I have a tiny bit of attraction with. I have a few dealbreakers and an idea of what I want in a partner but am quite open minded about seeing people to see if we're a good fit. However, since I changed my profile to look for life partner and such and with time, my likes went down dramatically. Also, since I'm only open to dating asians at the moment, I keep reaching the end of my pool here sooo many times.

I don't invest as much time as I did from October - December in looking (as at that point it become a full time job haha), so it's more of a side task now. But getting minimal results, it's somewhat discouraging. I've been going out more to try to meet people but I also want to try things I enjoy and not simply go out to do activities I think there will be single guys at. I started volunteering (because I enjoy it) and just doing activities I enjoy! But none of them give me many chances to meet single guys ah!

So... my question is, what do you guys recommend? Will me continue waiting on these apps and going on with life really give me the chance to meet someone or should I try harder again? But how? I'm a bit torn... as I love my city and want to stay here because my family and such are here. If I move cities there are definitely more options, but I don't exactly want to move just to date someone üòÇ. Just looking for feedback, thanks so much :)","The simple fact of the matter is you'll get as many answers as there are anecdotes.  I live in a small town and never thought I'd find love yet I'm a year into a relationship with the woman of my dreams.  There are plenty of people who will say that moving was the best thing they ever did.  People in small towns here complain about the lack of matches, people in large towns complain about having to dig through a never-ending mess.

Some will say making your profile too specific means you might miss the person who is perfect for you just because they didn't match on something you didn't realize you didn't really care about.  Some will say that making your profile too generic means you'll waste so much time on guys who aren't for you you'll miss the guy who is.

There is no one-size-fits-all answer.  Whatever you decide, the most important thing to do is to keep your heart open and your hopes high."

datingoverthirty,124wwuq,1680026390.0,How many prompts is TOO many?,"Hi all,

I recently decided to hop back on the dating apps (primarily starting with CMB, since that's where I feel like I've had the most success in the past) after a few month hiatus, and making sure that I was fully ready to jump back in, after a 3.5 year relationship ended last year. Now, CMB offers a ton of prompts (40+). In the past, I was unfortunately one of the daters that would put a bunch of fluff with maybe 4-5 prompts. I've since digested some podcasts and worked on myself (therapy, yoga.. yada yada). 

I'm obviously not going to answer them all (a few of them come off as weird or potentially insincere, but different topic for a different post), but how many is **too** many? Would you, as a prospective (or former) dater want 10+, or do you want 4-5 more comprehensive ones? I lean more toward the latter, but thought this would be a good place to query the audience. Thanks in advance!

Update: I'm a dummy, and realized CMB only allows 5 max prompts. Here I was typing out a bunch of responses, so I guess that answers that. Hopefully this is still a helpful query for folks on other apps or for general advice. If I move on from CMB, or expand out of it eventually, I will definitely be revisiting this thread.","I've used another app where people can answer a ton of prompts, and it's a waste because people never put anything all that substantial in them. I'd rather see 5 substantial answers than 10 short ones because I learn a lot more about someone's personality, thought processes, needs, and so on from more complex answers than I do from what usually ends up being a list of 10 facts about them."
datingoverthirty,124avpv,1679973381.0,Finally talked to this guy I've been wanting to meet IRL - super excited and also...now what??,"I (38F) posted a little over a week ago about a guy (40sM) I was curious about and trying to figure out a way to actually meet him, as he lives on a couple of acres in a wilderness spot across the street from a woman's property, who has some rescue horses I help with a few times a week. On the rare occasion, I would  pass him on his bicycle. But he was hard-core cycling up a steep hill while I was walking the horses, and while he'd ask how I was or something, you know, he was cycling, full get up, up a steep hill, awkward to stop and talk if I don't give him a reason to, so that was it. Though I got the sense, with the lingering eye contact and what not, that he was curious/attracted to me. We had another different sort of very brief run in a few weeks ago, that was cut short due to the woman interrupting, but I could better tell he was cute and the woman saw us flirting and told me he was single. And then I decided to get after it!

So today I was there again, really hoping today we'd finally have a chance to meet, and so I was letting the horses graze on a hill that belongs to him (he gave permission to the woman who owns them) and I was hoping he'd come out when I happened to be there, and he did! He was a little ways away, but I called out thanking him for letting us eat his grass, he joked that it was delicious so it's only fair to share it and he changed directions and walked towards me. I introduced myself and he him, he had his hands full and told me he was sorry but he was trying to be on time to meet his friends to go mountain biking, despite wanting to talk to me. We ended up talking just a bit more, he shared where he was going and I mentioned I was fairly new here and he asked where I moved from etc etc. He had a big smile and was super engaged with me the whole time. Then he said he wanted to talk more some time, but if he left now he would just barely make it on time. So we said bye -- I walked down to the woman's property and was back in the barn, and saw his car drive by and he lightly honked as he drove by. Presumably to say bye \~

I'm super introverted and since I've been dating the last few years, I've not met anyone in person I liked - it's all been on OLD, and wow - it feels so much better in person! I'm just so giddy and it's been so long since I have had a crush and had to use patience and be with the slow burn that is often required with IRL. And I just need to share about it because it feels so good!

I suppose you could say I am attracted to mutuality, as I've never liked a guy where there wasn't a real, significant and mutual connection between us (it's rare I like someone, and just about always turns into something when I do). So on the one hand, I'm not really worried about that, but at the same time, I want someone to tell me he likes me and want to know üòÇ I hope I wasn't making him talk to me, and I hope his honk when he drove by meant he likes me, haha. I feel like I'm in high school again üòÑ

And I'm bummed because I'm now going to be gone for the next 10 days. Damn. So what do I do when I get back? Just wait and hope he comes by and talks to me down at the barn? Ball's in his court kinda thing, since he had to go? Or make sure I'm near his property as often as possible, lol?? How do I let him know I'm single and want him to ask me out?

datingoverthirty,12447e7,1679958264.0,Profile Feedback [M 36],"Hi DOT! I am posting today because I would greatly appreciate some feedback on my profile and how I present myself. 

For some context, I am looking for a long term relationship and hopefully a life partner. 

Now, for some background on my recent experience. 

About three years ago I suffered a pretty major injury which kept me out of dating for almost two full years. I have been back actively dating for just over a year now. In that year, I have ended up in mostly casual dating situations including dating a few women in ENM/open relationships. This isn‚Äôt exactly what I am looking for but after  being sidelined for a couple of years, I was open to it! (It was a very long couple of years) 

I took a break from dating over the last month and now I want to start again and intentionally stay focused on the thing I am looking for - a relationship. 

What I would love feedback on - is there something about my profile that is contributing to the casual dating I have experienced or is that just kinda how things are? 

My intention with the profile was to be light and playful but did I overdo it? Is there anything I should change? Are my answers too light? Should I change my photos? Let me know! 

I have also included alternative photos at the end of my profile:

Thank you in advance!",You are very cute and your profile is WAY fun.  I'd swipe!  You're going to do great.
datingoverthirty,124d667,1679978968.0,How much stock do you put in ‚Äúit doesn‚Äôt feel right‚Äù?,"I‚Äôm a 32F dating a 36M. Everything is going very well, but perhaps as we are from different countries and backgrounds, there‚Äôs not quite the same ‚Äúclicking‚Äù feeling as I‚Äôm used to ‚Äî that familiar feeling of ‚Äúoh, we get each other‚Äù. 

Everything is moving forward smoothly, I have a crush on him, respect and appreciate him ‚Äî but it doesn‚Äôt feel 100% ‚Äúright‚Äù, as it might have in the past. It‚Äôs also worth mentioning that the relationships that supposedly felt right in the past did fail and were remarkably unhealthy).

I am also aware that I have a considerable amount of attachment anxiety and am always looking for the weakest part of any relationship to predict what may become our downfall.

I suppose I‚Äôm trying to discern between what might be a gut feeling of ‚Äúno, this is not your person‚Äù and ‚Äúoh, I‚Äôm actually subconsciously trying to sabotage this relationship because I‚Äôm scared‚Äù. Thoughts? Experiences?","I will say that people are quick to drop a situation these days without giving adequate time for the connection to blossom. There‚Äôs a variety of reason for this, but online dating culture and the illusion of endless options are one of the prime ones. If you have attachment anxiety, that is certainly another, so it‚Äôs good to be recognizing that.

It‚Äôs helpful to keep in mind that love is a surprise, it never shows up the same way twice, so don‚Äôt look for cues from your past, especially if those cues have lead to a pattern of unhealthy relationships.

Let something new unfold here. Even if it doesn‚Äôt work out, it‚Äôs worth it for the breaking of patterns and settling of anxieties. Make yourself available to any possibility and stick with what is happening, don‚Äôt preempt it with a theory about where it‚Äôs going.

Connections take time to form. Love requires a nurturing and a patience to take root. If he‚Äôs a good guy, then see what happens, and don‚Äôt worry if it‚Äôs the love of your life because short term relationships and friendships have value too."

datingoverthirty,123xa07,1679944768.0,Slow burn or just way too shy?,"I (34F) started seeing a (34M) recently. 4 dates so far. Very sweet guy and I‚Äôm attracted to him, but he‚Äôs VERY conservative and shy. I‚Äôm being very open minded and continuing to see him with the thought that he might be a ‚Äúslow burn‚Äù type, but something feels a bit off for me and I‚Äôm not sure if he‚Äôs just too shy/not the right fit. I have a habit of ditching my own needs to meet the needs of others so this is why I‚Äôm asking here (doing a lot of personal work to improve!).

We‚Äôve been out 4 times. The dates always end with nothing more than a half hug and him seeming very nervous. I‚Äôm finding that I‚Äôm leaving the dates feeling very platonic at best, and not feeling desired at all. I‚Äôm a very affectionate person, and prefer someone who is as well (verbally and physically).

He continues to ask me out, but that‚Äôs the only way I‚Äôm gauging any interest. He‚Äôs not asking me questions to get to know me versus starting to open up and tell me about himself, he‚Äôs not flirting nor giving me compliments, certainly not touching me at all. He did finally admit to me that he‚Äôs very slow when it comes to dating (I didn‚Äôt press on his reasons, he seemed nervous enough). I said I am too, and he immediately followed up that his version of slow would be slower than mine. I told him to move at the speed he‚Äôs comfortable with, but I‚Äôm getting the sense that‚Äôs not going to sync with what I‚Äôd prefer.

In all honesty, I‚Äôve never experienced this from a man so I‚Äôm a bit confused. I sense there may be some trauma at hand here, though I know his last relationship was healthy and ended on good terms.


So- do I keep giving this a chance because he‚Äôs a good person (it‚Äôs been VERY hard to find those where I live!) or do I cut this off because my basic needs simply aren‚Äôt being met? Any suggestions for things to ask him? I don‚Äôt have timelines or specific expectations, I‚Äôm just disappointed that this doesn‚Äôt feel remotely natural nor are my needs/wants being considered.

TIA!

EDIT: I‚Äôm always so grateful for everyone‚Äôs opinions, seriously. An update- this wasn‚Äôt right in my gut because I felt regardless of someone being nice, I wasn‚Äôt getting the basics that I needed (which I DID gently ask for an communicate). Turns out, when I communicated my own values and asked him a lot of questions regarding his, he admitted to being dishonest about certain things that were important to him that we actually didn‚Äôt align on in an effort to seem cool and easygoing. What I was picking up on was his obvious discomfort in being someone who he actually was not, and how uneasy that made him. Ah well, on to the next. Thanks again for all of the thoughtful POVs.","Why don't you ask him what he means by taking it slow, what is important to him in dating/relationships, and what his values are? 

The point of dating is to get to know each other. A lot of conservative people do not prioritize physical attachment or contact until/unless there is an emotional connection. You may be used to having a guy try to touch you or kiss you. However, there are men and women who view that as disrespectful if there is no bond or love involved. 

If you are wondering how he operates, you need to ask him."
datingoverthirty,123uws0,1679940004.0,Profile review [35F],"I am very nervous about posting this but I think I need some feedback. I had a much more generic profile awhile back and was getting 8-10 likes a week on Hinge. I changed it to be more reflective of me and now I‚Äôm getting none at all. It feels like the algorithm has hidden my profile but I‚Äôm willing to accept it could be the actual profile! Pictures double screen shotted to show captions.

Edit: thank you for all of the great feedback. I‚Äôm going to take a critical eye to my profile, pause it for a little while, and see what happens. I‚Äôve been moving to depend on more organic ways of meeting lately but I do think OLD has its place. I‚Äôm going to bed now so time to shut it down- I‚Äôll try to report back with results down the line if I remember.

datingoverthirty,1237cdo,1679881836.0,What do you do when you match someone but they don‚Äôt ask questions/put minimal effort in conversation?,"I‚Äôm sure this has happened to all of us. I feel like this is what happens to me 9/10. Doesn‚Äôt matter if we‚Äôve been talking 2 seconds or 2 days, those I match with simply don‚Äôt put in effort or seem to care/want to get to know me. I‚Äôm constantly asking questions and often they‚Äôll answer but they won‚Äôt ask a question in return. Even if it‚Äôs ‚Äúwbu‚Äù. After a while it just gets old. 

So 9/10 I‚Äôll just stop putting in the same effort. Match theirs. If they don‚Äôt ask me a question after I‚Äôve asked them several then I just stop asking questions. Usually the conversion just dies because they fail to send anything in reply. 

But I wonder if people respond to these situations differently than I do and have different/better results? Do you call them out on their behavior? Do you gently nudge the conversation? Etc. I‚Äôm curious what others do.","I will give it a couple of tries, but if I see no effort from her side, I'll just leave it be. I'm not desperate for a relationship, I have better use for my time than talking to a wall."
datingoverthirty,12376uq,1679881478.0,Give it another try after clearing some things up?,"So we dated maybe over 1/2 year now and there was an off period where she was putting her time into interview but that is over she is still very busy (she worked till5 this morning and going to work again after the date). I have been pretty much hands off since we last met in February and went out with her a couple of times when she reached out, like today when she wanted to watch a movie to destress.

We did have a discussion after the date where I asked where we are and felt there's some sort of a ""wall"" in going further with her. She said she still don't know much about me because we just go on dates maybe once every 2 weeks (recently) and I don't text her or anything in between that period. She even said we can meet for meal etc. since she gotta eat too etc. Which surprised me because I never had the impression she was down for those since she rarely replies to my texts. She said she doesn't reply much to her mom's texts either but it doesn't mean she doesnt read them. She says I can text her with how's it going, send her interesting happenings etc and we can have dinner dates after work too.

I am just surprised because she never mentioned these things before and with her not replying to my texts till few days later I just figured to not be ""needy"" and text her all the time. So it seems she wants me to do these things to get to know me better but never said it till now? I do feel not texting her for 2 weeks and go on a date is a bit weird but I was just going by her pace.... Should I try to just text her more and see her more if it goes anywhere? Maybe its just a misunderstanding?","How long are you going to keep dragging out this torture? This woman is playing games, wanting you to jump thru hoops while she does absolutely nothing, not even the bare minimum.

--- I wonder if I should include more engagement / question for them to start a conversation?

--- I noticed that Hinge has added a video and voice feature for the profiles since I last used it, and I would like to use these in a meaningful, personal, and/or fun way.

My last relationship (~1.5 year) ended because he wasn't interested / willing to work through his anxiety, fear, and aversion to commitment. 

This was the one I was most hopeful about and my longest relationship since college.

I last posted about that relationship here:

I'm frustrated to have gone through many alternative kinds of relationships / situationships to come back to my truest desire for partnership.

I'm frustrated again that this most recent partner was the best relationship I had in many years in some ways, but ultimately was missing critical elements to move forward with partnership, home, kids, etc. His actions didn't match what he said he wanted when we started dating.

Trying to rekindle some hope as I heal and prepare to move forward.","Sunflower pic first. Then acrobatic photo, followed by dancing pic! I'd personally delete any pics with children in them because apps can be full of creeps."

Especially when the profile is a reasonably good one.

It seems like a third of the comments are left by people who are trying to be genuinely helpful.  But the rest are far more revealing of the insecurities of the commenters themselves. If the OP expresses any sort of preference, you'll hear from the target gender (who surely have their own preferences, but who hate that they may ever be excluded from someone else's dating pool) why a particular preference is unjust, and how it could be ""limiting"" (as ALL preferences are).  You'll also see not-so-subtle shade being thrown from members of the same gender as the OP.  This, of course, as masked as advice that's trying to be constructive.

And it's always the reasonably good profiles where this happens.  The ones that aren't quite as good elicit a higher percentage of comments that are positive and encouraging.

datingoverthirty,122t4rj,1679851384.0,Are you the leader or the follower in relationships?,"Or maybe it's a give and take from both parties? To be more specific- when dating are you cautious to show emotional intimacy, and only show it when the other person does? Or are you a generally open person bring up important topics early on? 

I'm dating someone new for about a month and a half and it's going great. We both like each other- but I realized she is a really great communicator. She will ask me questions about  my past relationships, will show affection, ect. Before we had sex she asked me about my hots and nots, being tested, use of condoms, being exclusive. I love that she has the confidence to ask all these questions because I am generally much more reserved. Being intimate with anyone at the start of something new is scary. But if someone is taking the lead I will follow, and am open and honest. I realized that all my past successful relationships happened when the woman taking the lead on initiating these conversations.

I'm not asking for advice. I'm here generally curious about your thoughts in your own relationships about this. Will you openly bring up important topics that develop intimacy, or will you wait for the other person to? Do you think your communication style in this department hinders or advances your relationship?","Just make sure she‚Äôs not doing all the work all the time in taking the relationship forward and initiating emotional intimacy, that can get exhausting for the ‚Äúleader‚Äù after awhile."

Then I saw him on Saturday for third date, he wanted to have sex but I didn‚Äôt proceed. All three dates he took me to good restaurants and was being nice when we were outside. But I feel when we are inside he becomes a bit pushy on making out etc. And I felt yesterday when we got to a bit more intimate after (no sex) his body language was more leaning wanted to leave. And I don‚Äôt feel we have emotion connection so far just very strong chemistry. 

Funny thing is I know bunch of people and got to know he‚Äôs seeing 4 girls (including me). So he basically use the excuse he has to work late to every girl and go on date everyday. And it seems like everyone is in the similar pace, 2nd or 3rd date. 

I understand he‚Äôs single so he can date whoever he wants but it‚Äôs still crazy. I am looking for something more serious than just sex, but I‚Äôm also in a spot maybe moving away from the city soon. But I def can‚Äôt just be with someone who‚Äôs only in for sex and thrill of the chase.

datingoverthirty,121wr6p,1679773238.0,How do you overcome the feeling that there is something wrong with you if single in thirties?,I‚Äôm 32F and never married. I‚Äôve had a couple long term relationships. I often look around me and see everyone coupled up and I not sure how to shake the feeling that I went wrong somewhere or that there‚Äôs something inherently wrong with me. I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm an average 7 or 8/10 in attractiveness. Post grad education. The only thing I can think of is that I‚Äôve been living out of country for 7 years as an expat. I don‚Äôt have many friends and didn‚Äôt know anyone out of country either. How do you overcome or live with this feeling?,"TL;DR: Just because you haven‚Äôt found someone doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre broken. It just means you haven‚Äôt been lucky enough to find someone that aligns with you, and you haven‚Äôt settled. Don‚Äôt think that just because people are in a relationship that it means they are happy. Lots of unhappy couples just sticking it out. Focus on what you can control; which is to be a good person and the best version of you possible, and meet people. After that it‚Äôs all out of your control. 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Personally, I don‚Äôt feel like being single at 32 means you went wrong. And I‚Äôd argue that just because you see everyone around you couples up doesn‚Äôt mean they are HAPPILY coupled up. I‚Äôd wager that at least half of the people you see are in relationships that aren‚Äôt as great as you‚Äôd expect with the image they‚Äôre portraying. That might sound pessimistic but the fact is a lot of people stay in relationships out of convenience or fear of starting over. 

I guess what I‚Äôm saying is that you are in a position to use the maturity and wisdom your years have afforded you to find someone that truly aligns with your values and goals. I was married up until I was your age, and as far as the world saw we were a happy family. But inside those closed doors we had a dead bedroom and both of us were unhappy with our choice. But we stuck it out due to convenience and because we had a child. 

Now, at almost 37 I still haven‚Äôt had the luck of finding someone with whom to build a relationship. But that doesn‚Äôt mean there is something wrong with me. I know I‚Äôve done a lot of work to grow, become self aware, and figure out what I want in a relationship. It means that I haven‚Äôt crossed paths with someone that is right for me to build a relationship with. It‚Äôs HARD finding someone to build a relationship with, and not just settle. Yes, there are people who have things broken and that needs fixing before they can have a relationship. But I wouldn‚Äôt put too much pressure on yourself or judge yourself too harshly. Fact is, if you have family and long-term friends who love you then chances are that you‚Äôre an alright person. 

Wow, that was long haha. This is all to say that you can‚Äôt beat yourself up over this. It‚Äôs too easy to think you‚Äôre broken because you haven‚Äôt found someone. But if you‚Äôre taking the time to grow and be the best version or you, then that‚Äôs all you can control. The rest is up to fate and you putting yourself out there and meeting people. It‚Äôs a numbers game, and you gotta keep playing if you wanna find your person. Good luck.

datingoverthirty,121vvco,1679771401.0,Moving cities,"Hi,

I (32F) have been dating a guy (34M) for two months. We haven‚Äôt defined the relationship or really had the talk about being exclusive yet. I was away travelling on business for a bit so we‚Äôve been seeing each other every week or two, we‚Äôve had several dates so far.

Two weeks ago he was out of the city, visiting his friends and family in a city nearby, where he was for a total of four days. The city isn‚Äôt too far but it‚Äôs about a 3 hour drive. I don‚Äôt have a car. 

Just the other day he confessed to me that he‚Äôs moved to the city where he was. He was actually looking at houses while he was there. He confessed he didn‚Äôt want to tell me because he was nervous I would see that as a dealbreaker.

Now I feel like a fool and crossed because I am shocked he kept this from me. I understand his reasoning but it‚Äôs not realistic to me that this will work out. 

How should I feel?","He wanted to sleep with you and was afraid that wouldn‚Äôt happen if you knew he was moving away.

I‚Äôm not sure why else he wouldn‚Äôt have been up front about it, even if the relationship was meant to be casual. There‚Äôd be no other reason to lie, and those things never really happen with no warning.

You should feel like he‚Äôs a shithead."
datingoverthirty,121lnn1,1679750405.0,Profile review (34m),"I'm back on the apps after a brief pause with a new crop of photos and a new mindset. In the past my goals have included gaining more dating experience and broadening my horizons, and I pursued some casual opportunities as I got over a breakup. I'm heading out of that season and feel ready to look more intentionally for a partner now, and I'd love DOT's help optimizing my profile.

Some context:

- I live in a rust belt city, not small but not huge, and I'm car-free so I'm only dating in the city itself, not the whole metro area.

- I get a few likes a week and a couple matches per month. I have pretty good success with meeting people IRL, and treat OLD as a supplement to that. 

- I'm interested in women with at least a college education (in practice everyone I've ever dated either had an advanced degree or was working on one), an ambitious career and some kind of gym habit -- my last serious relationship was with a weightlifter and the last person I was really excited to go on a date with had a side gig as a yoga instructor, so I don't have one specific archetype here but health and activity are important to me. I understand my competition is quite stiff.

- I expect that being a PhD student at 34 is limiting my matches -- some people will like it and some won't. I think I defy the negative PhD stereotypes in that I'm in good shape financially and have a good work-life balance, and have tried to convey that impression in my profile.

- I'm considering switching out the dad joke recording for a poll prompt, but I have received several likes from the joke, including one who said they ""adored"" my voice.

Edit: thanks for all the feedback, folks. Fairly perplexed and discouraged by most of it, but I'm focusing on the comments that gave me honest profile feedback instead of critiquing my life choices.","You‚Äôre my type and I‚Äôm fairly certain I know what city you‚Äôre in, grew up in the area and went to undergrad there. It‚Äôs not a great place to be car-free. Do you cycle? I‚Äôd swipe right and we‚Äôd have a lot in common but I agree with others that perhaps you‚Äôre limiting your options? How do you define ‚Äúhigh-achieving‚Äù for the women you date‚ÄîI ask because I think there‚Äôs a contradiction in most places of the US of being car-free and high-achieving. Most so-called high-achieving people especially in your area will have a car and expect you to have one too, and I think that‚Äôs going to cause issues. I had a car while living in that city but now I don‚Äôt because I live in Europe and don‚Äôt have to. But car culture is a thing and depending on the type of ‚Äúhigh-achieving‚Äù you‚Äôre looking for, I don‚Äôt think that certain types will accept a car less boyfriend. Now, if you‚Äôre looking for a women who is eco friendly and not as status-conscious‚Äîbecause I think ‚Äúhigh-achieving‚Äù often is about status‚Äî then you might have more luck with that target audience. 

I think the profile overall is fine but it could be you‚Äôre limiting yourself."

We've messaged over the app a lot this past week and we met today for a walk with his dog. I didn't feel any chemistry on my end but he seems very interested. 

During the conversation today, he mentioned that he and a couple of his friends had made appointments at my work for this coming week (I'm a receptionist at a reproductive health clinic) and asked if I was going to be there that day. We had discussed my job and my schedule a couple days before. Is it just me or is this bizarre? It made me feel really uncomfortable. 

Ordinarily in this situation where I'm not feeling any chemistry, I'd be honest with the person and disconnect. However, since I'll be seeing him at my job this week I feel obligated to continue talking with him at least until then. Idk, I'm just getting weird, creepy vibes from that.

Thoughts?

ETA: Thanks for the creep validation everyone! I told him that I didn't feel like we clicked initially but that I was really uncomfortable that he crossed the boundary into my work life and that we needed to disconnect and move on. He apologized and said he'd cancel his appointment (although I won't know if he did or not until I'm at work on Monday).","Not just weird that he asked about your work schedule, but also... he's making a trip to the reproductive health clinic *with friends*??

However, there are some matches that want to meet me but I just can‚Äôt help but feel like it‚Äôs a chore to do so. 

Their pictures are decent, but could be better. For the most part our conversation is stimulating enough. These guys keep on messaging me to meet up and I end up feeling kind of obligated to do so.

On one hand, I figure you never know who you‚Äôre going to meet. Maybe it‚Äôs someone really cool and I‚Äôm pleasantly surprised. On the other hand, I‚Äôve had more bad dates than I can count and I‚Äôm starting to feel like I‚Äôm going to grow old alone.

I kind of agreed to a date with this one guy I‚Äôm feeling ‚Äòmeh‚Äô about and I‚Äôm already regretting it. I have another date with a guy who‚Äôs more my type this weekend and I‚Äôm actually really looking forward to it.

I just don‚Äôt know why I feel this way. Are they actually ‚Äòmeh‚Äô or are my avoidant tendencies kicking in because they are overly interested and double messaging me too much?

Should I just let the ‚Äòmeh‚Äô guy down now?
Or should I go on the date? I can‚Äôt seem to make a decision. What would you do?","Online ""compatibility does NOT equal real world compatibility.  No matter how good the conversation, pictures, etc. are in the digital realm, in person is all that matters.  Some of the best in person interactions i've had are with people that weren't that great online.  I don't use online to judge how someone is going to be in real life.

What has seemed to work out best for myself is minimal online interaction and move to meet up in person as soon as possible.

(Edit) Also wanted to add against:

>guys keep on messaging me to meet up and I end up feeling kind of obligated to do so

Don't ever feel like your obligated to do anything of the sort.  What I would say though is to evaluate how much time/energy you're putting into people that you don't really have an interest in.  It's not about quantity, it's about quality.  Cut bait on those you don't feel are worth your time."
datingoverthirty,120pfqo,1679675267.0,34M Profile Review,"Been on Bumble for a few months now, swiping pretty consistently with zero matches. I don't think I'm a super model by any extent, but I know I'm not ugly either. I also don't think I'm being too picky on my end. I would say I swipe right on 60-70% of women.

The weird thing is that my Hinge profile with almost the exact same content does much better and I'm guessing this is because I can be the one to initiate the match instead of Bumble's more random approach.

Perhaps I'm slightly 'damaged goods' because I have kids. I've had some promising matches on Hinge only to be unmatched once they find out I have kids and can't have anymore lol.

Anyways, any feedback would be very helpful! 
https://imgur.com/a/Muxa2Du","You are 34M, have 2 kids (probably under the age of 10?)) and can't have more - I think that's the main reason.

Many women in the age range of around 25-38 who'd be okay with you having kids still want their own, so a man who can't have more is not what they're looking for.

Many women who don't want kids are not okay with a man who already has them, especially when the kids are still small (usually under 10/12 years).

That leaves a small pool of women who don't want their own kids but are okay with you having them half the time and single moms who don't want more kids but are open to a man with kids (which often leads to problems with schedules) .

Your profile further states that you are very much into sports and very active but nothing else.

So what I see from your profile is: There's a man who is not available for a relationship at least 50% of the time because he has to take care of his kids (which is great and how it should be).

But will he be available to date me and build a relationship with me in the 50% of kid-free time he has, if he is always out doing sporty things in his free time? Can we only see each other once every other week if he's so busy?

Your whole profile is about your kids and your passion for sport but it's not necessarily appealing to a woman with her own life who doesn't know you yet. What else are you interested in? How do you want to spend time with a new partner? Because if you spend your week without the kids meeting friends at games and practicing for two or three different sports there's probably not much room for a relationship."

datingoverthirty,120jqln,1679663246.0,Dealing with a depressed partner.,"I don‚Äôt know where to go for this‚Ä¶ I (35M) have been dating a woman (28F) I first met in my church‚Äôs Bible study group.  I will admit that initially I wasn‚Äôt attracted to her because she‚Äôs a bit overweight, but I started learning about who she is and how her mind and heart work and I honestly started falling in love with her and being attracted to WHO she is rather than what she looks like.  We became friends and then really good friends over the course of a year.  She is smart, kind, loving, witty (I have never shared a sense of humor so innately with a woman), and in general she is an absolute delight to be around.  I have **never** connected with a romantic partner in so many ways as with her.  But after we started dating I learned more about her, namely that every single month during her period she becomes an emotional nightmare and goes into this horribly frustrating, ‚Äúlife sucks, I suck, and I hate everybody and everything to the point that I never want kids or animals or any responsibility whatsoever so I might as well just die‚Äù mode for about 3 days.  After dating for a couple months I decided this was insane and too much for me and broke up with her, but then she took a few months to work on herself and I started noticing changes to her mindset at group.  She approached me a few months afterwards and said ‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôve been working on this and I realized you were right.  I just wish you would‚Äôve given me the courtesy of sticking out my growth with me instead of leaving me to do it on my own.  Walk through my darkness with me so I don‚Äôt have to be alone for it.‚Äù

Well, long story short I decided to give her another chance, and we‚Äôve been dating for almost a year now.  Problem is that I haven‚Äôt seen any progress since.  When it‚Äôs good‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs great.  But she still goes into full-on misery mode every month.  To be honest I start panicking during these times because I have zero clue how to handle them.  If I try to empathize, she negates everything I say.  If I try to instruct, she rejects anything I tell her and says it‚Äôs all hopeless and nothing matters.  If I try to give her space she tells me I‚Äôm rejecting her and she needs me to stay with her.  I asked her how she‚Äôd like me to handle it and she gave me some advice, but then if I try to put that advice into practice she tells me that I shouldn‚Äôt just be parroting off her advice in my own way of saying it, or negating everything regardless as if her advice she gave wasn‚Äôt applicable when it‚Äôs actually happening.

How am I supposed to help and/or be with a person who experiences nihilistic depression every month for a few days?","Communication is really important, and really challenging in a relationship.

Ask other married couples in your church for their two cents. They will be able to guide you two toward a more effective method.

Basically, you want to be able to signal to her in a non threatening way, that hey, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre coming really hard and negative, can you be aware of this? I‚Äôm your lover, and I want to help you through this.‚Äù It‚Äôs even more effective if you can share why YOU are so sensitive to this response personally. Does it hurt you? Are you scared? Does it remind you of something? What about this is specifically hard for you to deal with?

And she needs to recognize, ‚Äúhey, what about this is bothering my partner? How can I hear him in the moment without being reactive?‚Äù If it‚Äôs hormones, maybe I needs an outlet to vent and get some release, or maybe i need to see a doctor?‚Äù She needs to contemplate it intentionally

And for you, I mean, no offense..but her uterine lining is literally shedding and causing hormonal displacement that‚Äôs surging through her body on a cellular level. So, keep that in mind.

Perhaps it‚Äôs something you both put into your calendars so you know ahead of time, ‚Äúhey, this is the time where we both need to be more sensitive toward each other to improve how this goes in the future‚Äù

Your church will help you.

PS. I hear resentment from you about her weight. You need to sort that out for yourself, it won‚Äôt go away, it will only grow. Can you accept her as she is? Is her trying to improve going to ever be enough for you? 

We‚Äôre all with fault and fucked up, ya know? Maybe she can loop you in on some of what her experiences with your faults are - not to smush it in your face - but to remind you that we all need tolerance and patience. As lovers, your primary role is to provide that to each other - it‚Äôs biblical"

We established pretty early on that we had grown up differently. (Me: parents lower-middle class in a predominantly working class community / Him: honestly one of the wealthiest communities in our state. Me: culturally Appalachian (?), grandpa (‚ÄúPapaw‚Äù to me, lol) was a Baptist Pastor / Him: Catholic dad / Jewish mom). 

I pointed this out on first date and he said ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs 2023!‚Äù 

I‚Äôm very financially successful now but I proudly identify with being working class. I also made sure he was aware that I identify as a Socialist also. TBH, it‚Äôs not my first choice to date someone born with a silver spoon in their mouth, but I feel it would be weirdly prejudicial to exclude someone who checks a lot of other boxes (I find them attractive, same taste in music and movies, we both like gardening) just for that.

We were doing well. I thought we had a good communication rhythm going and then very suddenly‚Ä¶it felt like a slow fade.

No real engagement with my texts, long periods of time between communication (I stopped texting as much because he wasn‚Äôt being responsive). A day we were supposed to hang out - he started adding other commitments so that we could only get together between 10pm and 9 am üôÑ (booty call).

Idk I could feel the slow fade coming but I keep my commitments, so I still hung out. But we had a good time and then he changed again. He went back to normal.
So I thought ok, he was legitimately busy! It happens!

Yesterday tho, via text, he told me his parents are elitists. And that he had broken it off with other people he didn‚Äôt think they‚Äôd approve of etc etc. Reading between the lines I think he was slow fading me because he didn‚Äôt think his parents would approve of me. Had a change of heart and then reengaged.

I find this very off-putting. No one is better than anyone else. And I cannot conceive of breaking it off with a good person who I otherwise liked for a reason like this. What if I really fall for him and he has a change of heart for the same reason again? And then it‚Äôs not like ‚Äúbummer a wasted month‚Äù but a horrible insulting heartbreak and wasted years!

datingoverthirty,11yp3mw,1679504212.0,I'm dating someone who critical about everything. What should I do?,"Edit: Thank you for all the help. She was invalidating about my feelings and tried to make me feel bad about bringing it up. I ended it after trying to talk it through. 

So I(31m) have been dating someone(30f) for the past three months and I'm starting to notice a pattern of this person being critical and wondering how I should approach it. I feel so much better now. 

If we go out and see something like a sign for example that explains how something works, this person always feels the need the need to offer some rebuttal instead of leaving it be. One time we were asked to fill out a customer survey as we were finishing shopping at a furniture store. They're pretty straightforward questions and easy to fill out but it seems like I had to stop every question because she had something critical to say to about questions being asked. That was my first glimpse of it. Later she tells me that it's because she's just direct. Eventually on another date, she then tells me that she's not a nice person. I overlook it since she can be really hard on herself and we have moments like that. I ask her what she means but she doesn't tell me anything concrete.

Fast forward to our recent date, which I was late to. I felt like I was being battered by a wave of scrutiny. I received the ""if it was important to you then would you really be late?"". I even double-checked our messages to make sure I didn't misread the time when were supposed to meet. I was late by 5 minutes but according to her it was a full 20 minutes. I didn't want to point this out since I didn't want to argue since I'd rather enjoy the date.  We later sit down at her house to play a board game which I told her I was excited to show her so we could play. She then dismisses it saying she didn't know why I would bring it when I should have brought a party game that would be more fun. Okay so that doesn't work out. I'm starting to feel bad about myself and it's showing in my body language. I then begin to put on a movie which I had also told her prior to the date would be something she would like and I was excited to show her. Before starting it she asked me if it was a comedy and that it should be funny because she wants to watch something funny. At this point, I'm completely overwhelmed and caught off guard since I normally take the lead in planning dates. I was blaming myself and questioning my decisions. The final straw happens when she asks me if I brought anything to drink and I tell her I didn't. She makes a comment about me must being a poor planner and not going to other people's places often because of that.  She notices that I'm feeling bad and asks why I look stressed. When I tell her why she tells me I need to not be since it doesn't make me look good. 

In the moment I felt bad about myself and blamed myself. Normally I don't feel like that and I'm pretty okay with myself when I make mistakes since they happen to everyone. I later realized that I felt bad because of how I was treated. Maybe I didn't communicate well prior to the date but I also feel like I didn't deserve to treated the way I was. How should I approach this? Should I try talking about this? If so, what should I say? Or should I just end it? This seems like something that could continue.

I‚Äôve been on dates like there‚Äôs no tomorrow (like it‚Äôs been super nice for the most part but dying to explore something that actually sticks)","It‚Äôs the burden of choice, grass is greener type of mentality. Unless you somehow tick every box for them right away, seemingly a majority of people don‚Äôt even give a chance to establish compatibility or chemistry.

It‚Äôs a self-fulfilling prophecy when it comes to that cycle of ‚Äúnext‚Äù as you mention. There‚Äôs a bigger dating pool in metro areas, so people aren‚Äôt as willing to settle, per se.

I live in a major metro area, and while I get a good number of matches, it‚Äôs like pulling teeth to get people on dates let alone establish a relationship."

We've had disagreements and communicated throught them in a way im really proud of. We've talked about serious issues, travelled together, met some family and i feel like this is the person i want to do life with but....

Our parents aren't fans....

His mom didnt have positive things to say after meeting me (I talk too much sometimes, I talk to softly other times, I'm a gold digger because he takes me on dates, I overfeed him because I cook for him, im manipulative because he watched a disney movie with my while I was sick and we didnt spend that time with her)

My dad refuses to even meet him because we're not the same race. He thinks I should stick with men of my own race but i never have....in all my years..grrr

So where do we go from here? We talk about marriage, moving in, kids but im at a loss sometimes.  He loves his mom and i love my dad and we both want them to support us but they refuse.

You arrive for a first date with someone you met on an app and the second you greet them, immediately their face falls and the entire date is wildly uncomfortable because they‚Äôre visibly disappointed to be with you. 

As a bigger woman (5'10"", size 14/16) I spend a lot of time ensuring my dating profile is EXTREMELY transparent about who I am and what I look like. I don‚Äôt use filters, I don‚Äôt retouch my photos, I don‚Äôt use deceptive angles or cropping‚Ä¶ in fact, I deliberately choose a couple of ‚Äúunflattering‚Äù pics. I have very clear face pics (with and without makeup) and multiple full body pictures. All of my photos are recent and I constantly ask for people to review my profile to ensure I‚Äôm accurately representing myself. Whenever I match with someone and we eventually move to texting, I send additional pics. 

I‚Äôm not super attractive, but I know I‚Äôm not ugly. I don‚Äôt hide aspects of my personality, I text exactly how I talk and refuse to water myself down for others. I know I‚Äôm not universally considered desirable, so I don‚Äôt want to waste my time by pretending to be someone I‚Äôm not just to trick people into going on dates.

I date both men and women ranging in age from 25 to 48, so it‚Äôs not a gender thing or an age thing. 

It is extremely bewildering when my dates seem surprised/confused/disappointing when the person in the photos shows up. If I‚Äôm not your type, why are you asking me on a date?

This seems like a massive waste of the other person‚Äôs time to spend upwards of multiple weeks talking to someone, planning a date, knowing you‚Äôre not actually interested in me.

I can‚Äôt be the only person experiencing this.","Unless they said to you, ""I thought you might look better in person,"" I think you're projecting your own anxieties into these people.  Going on dates through apps is nerve-wracking and awkward.  They could just be feeling nervous when they meet you and you're reading it as they are unattracted to you."

I (33M) came out of a serious 6.5 year relationship 8 months ago. I dealt with it by getting immediately back out there and meeting lot of new girls. Within a month I was basically in an exclusive relationship again. That lasted about 6 months and never got particularly serious so now I‚Äôm back to square one as of about 1-2 weeks ago. I‚Äôve had a few friends and family tell me that I need to take time out of dating to spend time on my own. I understand the arguments to do so but just not something I generally subscribe to. I‚Äôm quite a content person and have most elements of my life together at this point.

datingoverthirty,11wtda2,1679341270.0,Advice: bread crumbing or going through something,"I 32F dated this guy 34M last year and we stopped talking because he wanted to be exclusive with another girl he started dating a bit before me. This happened in March/April of last year.

I reached out to him because I wanted a contact for a referral for a something. We started hanging out as friends and hangout 2-3 times a week and message everyday. Always having a good chat. This has been happening since October. 

A week after Valentine‚Äôs Day, we hooked up, and wanted to try dating but taking it slow - and explicitly mentioned not FWB.

Roughly the same week, work hit the fan for him, lots of stress and long hours, and text was getting less durning work hours. He also got a new video game system and a new game which he‚Äôs been playing a lot - which I‚Äôm assuming as an escape and also..new toy. 

I lean AA, and I‚Äôm getting triggered with a lot of this because I‚Äôm finding he‚Äôs been less enthusiastic with me and cadence is changing and i am finding it extremely confusing and overall its triggering the heck out of me. I can‚Äôt figure out if its actual losing engagement or just like busy and shutting down. The lack of communication is nuts. When I am stressed, I don‚Äôt shut down and not respond to people so its hard for me to gauge. We do talk but like once a day and sometimes not. 

Last week, i asked for him to come over to chat and we can have a drink. He bailed because a serious issue was happening at work. He was suppose to come over at 6ish and i followed up at 6:30 and he said work immideate issue is happening and at 8pm i told him to forget it. Didn‚Äôt hear a thing until the next day where he apologized where i told him I didn‚Äôt appreciate his lack of communication. he apologized and said he got consumed with work. Which triggered me even more because i wanted to chat about where he is - and he hasn‚Äôt planned a hang or anything. 

While reading this, doesn‚Äôt sound great, but my gut is saying its just work and hes getting stressed and shutting down. I am unsure on how to address in a way where I am sticking up for myself and doing myself justice while not like attacking if that makes sense. I want to reach out but I don‚Äôt want to alway arrange everything and in my eyes - he canceled he should reschedule. 


Also, I noticed we have different love languages, he‚Äôs really only physically affectionate and words of affirmation and really opens up more while in bed cuddling. He isn‚Äôt a big cuddles while watching TV and a big flirter. But i need some reassurance to know he‚Äôs in it, but with everything mentioned above I don‚Äôt see it or feel it. When we DO cuddle i feel the intimacy, connection and all that good stuff but outside of that, I don‚Äôt. 

I‚Äôm looking for some advice onto handle thing and communicate it with him. But really, I don‚Äôt want to blast him on text but i also don‚Äôt want to reach out to hang. I‚Äôm torn because part of me knows work is busy - you can see it when we met up - and the lack of communication is baffling to me.","If someone is into you, you know.

Hello. A bit of a teenage girl issue here. Met a guy from Bumble few years ago, went on dates, didn‚Äôt develop into anything and just became FWB for a while. We dated other people in between when not speaking to each other. He moved abroad for work last year but might move back in a few years.

I do like him and to be honest would want to develop a relationship with him as he checked a lot of my boxes except wanting a relationship with me‚Ä¶ He‚Äôs an avoidant one with complicated relationships in the past. 

We met recently as he was visiting and he said we had a lot of chemistry (and of course wanted to sleep with me but I turned it down because I am now in a mindset wanting things more serious). I have been quite casual about my feelings for him as he rejected me a few years ago with reasons about moving abroad/complicated ex. I just never cut tie with him as feel like he could be the one when the right time comes.

I‚Äôm turning 31 now and start to establish boundaries with men. Shall I 
1: Not respond to his message, delete his number and move on
Or
2: Explain my true feelings for him even I might get more rejection responses and if so, delete and block him to avoid future breadcrumbs

People are way too obsessed with **IRL vs. OLD.**  Most of us prefer IRL when it's an option and use OLD when it's not. Neither one excludes the other, and, for many of us, both at once is a viable solution.

Every few days there's a post on here about quitting OLD and why IRL is better and more natural (plus there are the pushy dudes who seem to haunt the profile reviews saying 'quit online dating' to anyone who'll listen). But IRL is also hard to do, in this day and age, when big friend groups are becoming a thing of the past. Plus sometimes bars, clubs, and friend groups are not always effective ways to meet someone. Often luck is just against you. 

My point in all this is simple: trying to say one way of dating is good and the other is bad misses the point: dating is tough and involves a fair amount of luck no matter how you slice it.  Most of us, were it viable, would focus more on In Real Life and less on Online, but we're making do with what's available to us.

**TL;DR** Stop looking for magic bullets. Dating is tough. IRL and OLD are not mutually exclusive and shouldn't be."
datingoverthirty,11vt6v8,1679250261.0,How to deal with sex that takes forever,"Throwaway account, bc nsfw. I am a 38\[F\] who dates men. For context, I enjoy sex and like to have it sooner rather than later when I am interested in potentially dating someone. Recently I've noticed that several of the most recent men I've slept with take a long time to get off, often needing pretty intense stimulation. I mean a full 30-40 minutes, if not more, after I have gotten off. I very much believe both partners should do their best to satisfy the other, but after awhile I get sore, or even bored. And sometime the intensity of movement they need to get there is a lot. There's also this narrative of 'oh I'm such a hot shot I can last forever' that I think can actually be quite annoying in IRL situations. It's gotten to the point in my experience that I recently had a guy I've been talking to say 'I'm blessed with being able to last forever' and in my head I was like ...I'm not sure I want to sleep with you then.

I know things change as men get older, but I talked to one man recently about it because it took so long I often didn't want to have sex in the morning because we'd have to wake up way earlier to fit it in. He watches a lot of porn (doesn't bother me) but seemed reticent to change any behaviors and didn't really see the problem. Has anyone had a similar issue, or success in talking to a partner about it? And to be clear, I'm not saying I want quickie sex all the time, I'm talking specifically about men that need a lot of time, every single time to get there, whether that's due to age, porn, death grip, whatever.","I've had this happen recently, sometimes I love when we last an hour, sometimes it gets to be too much. I've used the line ""I'd love for you to cum on my chest"" and it usually ends penetration. He'll  pull out and either him or I will use our hands to finish him off, all over me. Still hot for both of us :p"
datingoverthirty,11vonkq,1679240786.0,Ditching OLD for IRL,"Does anyone completely rely on IRL meets for dates? 
I find having OLD makes me lazy and more likely to bail on events as I feel like I can just swipe away from my couch to try and ‚Äúmeet ppl‚Äù 

However I have been on OLD on and off for a few years with nothing long term coming from it except meeting a slew of people with commitment issues. 
So that phrase insanity is trying the same thing and expecting a different result is ringing in my ear. 

My fear of IRL is that firstly the cadence of dates is less, secondly there is so much less control (in OLD you know everyone‚Äôs bio before you meet them) IRL you know nothing about them at first not even their age, thirdly a lot of people I have met IRL whom there is an initial spark I usually find out that they are partnered. 

So just keen to hear experience of people who get dates or have gotten dates almost exclusively through IRL. 

Thanks in advance xx","I went to a speed dating event where I met the person I have been seeing for a couple of months.

If you are anywhere near a city I would try looking up speed dating events/single events/stuff on Meetup.

The idea of apps really doesn't appeal to me. I don't like being on my phone all the time, I'm kind of wary and guarded in general and have reservations about meeting up with total strangers and I also don't like being messed about. One reason I really like this man I am dating now is that he checks in quite a lot and also lets me know when he's on the way to our dates and it's really taken some of the anxiety out of the dating process."

I also don't like being single anymore, but I'm not meeting the right people for me, so it's not really a choice right now. 

I think I'm becoming apathetic to the process of online dating. It's almost starting to feel like a second job to match and make small-talk with people. I am no longer as excited to go on dates like I used to be, hence why I should quit. 

What do you guys do to fill the social void when your friends are too busy for you? How do you make new single friends when you're 30?","37M.  I‚Äôm also quitting.  I deleted all the apps.

The apps made me miserable and wasted hours swiping.  So I‚Äôm resisting redownloading them.  Dating is awful right now anyway. 
So I‚Äôm focusing on work, go to the gym, and chill at home.  I have friends. But like you they are in relationships.  So I‚Äôm usually a 3rd wheel.  I have found I like doing things on my own.

datingoverthirty,11vf0pk,1679212358.0,"Struggling to come to terms with not feeling ""love"" when I'm not even sure what it feels like...","I can't help but feel like I have an unrealistic expectation of what ""love"" should be. I was married before and thought I was in love, but in hindsight I think it was just NRE and after a very long time - and after having separated - it became obvious that I wasn't in love with this person. I've since dated and have had two women that I've shared a deep connection with, but I can't say that it has been love. And by that, I mean that I didn't feel for them what I would imagine I should if I were to be in love with them. These were relationships where we got along very well, I enjoyed their company, the physical chemistry was definitely there, etc. But yea, no ""love"".

I guess part of the problem is that I might not know what love feels like, since I honestly don't think that I've ever felt it. Yea, I've had relationships in the past where I've been with someone and early on all the usual butterflies and giddy feelings, but I know that isn't love, and is more than likely just that NRE. So the problem I have now is that I get to a place where I have a relationship with someone that is great on paper, but I feel like I should be feeling ""love"", whatever that means? Just typing it out I feel silly because I can't even describe the feeling that is lacking - I have no reference point. 

Which is all to say that I guess I'm needing some perspective. I know that what we conventionally associate with ""love"" is primarily a chemical cocktail that fires off in the brain to bond us with the person we are seeing, and that eventually that dies down. How do I know if I'm in love when I'm not even sure if I've ever felt it? And in the situation where I am happy with someone, but don't feel that feeling of ""love"", am I cheating myself to stay in what is otherwise a happy situation but one in which I can't say there is ""love""? Do I even need it to be happy? And is it fair to that other person? 

I guess I'm examining these questions because looking back I can see that the thing that was missing from what were otherwise great relationships was some sort of feeling like I was in love. And moving forward, if I am in a similar situation, I want to have the right mindset so that I'm not leaving a situation that might be perfect for me, but for the lack of this fleeting feeling of love. Hope that makes sense, and look forward to some perspective. Thanks :)","I think love comes in many forms, and some of us are still learning how to recognize love in its many forms. 

If you‚Äôre a sculptor and you created a marble statue that you‚Äôre proud of, you could call it ‚Äúa work of love‚Äù. Maybe you spent years chiseling away at the marble carefully to create it. Maybe you had to discard previous versions of the statue because it wasn‚Äôt what you envisioned in your head. Maybe you learned from your mistakes while sculpting it to finally arrive at a statue you‚Äôre proud to call your work of love. If someone destroyed your statute, you might feel angry about it. And that anger would be because you loved the statue because it encompassed a part of you and someone destroying it felt like they destroyed the part of you that the statue represented. You could love a non-living thing. 

You could love friends and family members because they‚Äôve been with you through thick and thin. They supported you when you were at your lowest, and celebrated your wins with you. You love them because they see the best in you and want the best for you. You love them because they set you straight when you‚Äôve strayed from your path. You could love people platonically. 

You could love a romantic partner for the way they find humor in the oddest things, because it shows they think outside the box. You could love them because they‚Äôre the kind of person who would help someone in a wheelchair cross the street because they have a big heart. You could love them for choosing to go back to school to learn new things because it shows that they have passion and motivation. You could love the way they cry during the sad parts of the movies because it shows how vulnerable they are. Their favorite mug is your favorite mug because they saw something special in that mug. Maybe you love them because they chose to love you first. 

You could love abstract concepts. You could love the idea of love or being in love. You could love the amazing things that humanity is capable of, despite all the terrible things humanity has done. You could love the concept of being alive and living your best life. You could love the concept of knowing someone today even if you never talk to them again. You could love the thought of reading strangers‚Äô thoughts about love to you. 

I think about all the things I love, of which there are many, and they‚Äôre all things I love about myself as well. I choose to love freely and liberally. Some days I have lots of love to give and some days I don‚Äôt. On the days when I feel like I am not loving, they‚Äôre usually days when I struggle with loving myself. On those days, I look to others to show me how to love again. And thankfully, I have friends who choose to love me and they tell me ‚Äúis your cup empty? Here, you can have some from my cup‚Äù

If you only look for one specific form of love, or if you build an idea of what love is *supposed* to look like in your head, you‚Äôll miss out on the way that love is ever present and how incredible it can be. 

I think I want someone who could love me even when I struggle to love myself. I want someone to show me that I‚Äôm not difficult to love, and maybe I‚Äôm even easy to love, so that I could see my own worth even while I covered my eyes and closed my heart. And then I learned that I even while I struggle to love myself, I could still find parts of me that I love. The more I learn to love myself, the less frequently I struggle with loving myself. The more I learn to love others, the more I learn to love myself, and the more I learn to love myself, the more I learn to love others.

I guess what I‚Äôm saying is that love is many things. It‚Äôs people, it‚Äôs objects, it‚Äôs concepts, it‚Äôs feelings and emotions, it‚Äôs places and times. It‚Äôs the seasons. It‚Äôs the weather. It‚Äôs the sense of comfort. It‚Äôs the sense of discomfort. Learn to recognize it in its many forms. Maybe you need someone to show you love. Maybe you need to decide what is love for yourself. Whatever you decide it is, it‚Äôs yours."

Please note: neither myself nor the mod are looking for rants/complaints about the lack of bios being deal breakers. ***I'm looking for comments from people who choose to not write a profile/bio, or barely anything in it.*** Please feel free to repsond to those comments, but avoid starting off new threads that start the same way and do mot answer the question! 

 I am somebody who finds it very difficult to start a conversation without a starting point, and it would be nice to know if we have any shared interests (and I mean ANY, even if generic).

 I've tried the compliments about their eyes, smiles, etc, but they usually get ignored. 
I've tried talking about things in their pictures. Again, mostly get ignored but usually ends up being conversations 3 replies long, often focused on them. 

It's for these reasons I tend to swipe right or no on those who have no bios, but occasionally I'll cave and swipe based on looks. 
How many great matches are being missed because I'm not immediately attracted to you AND you [seemingly] can't be bothered to write a bio? 

It's even more annoying because I have a decent amount in my profile that can act as convo starters.","I have a feeling that most of those who don‚Äôt want to put in the effort to write a bio, won‚Äôt put in the effort to explain themselves here.

datingoverthirty,11utesz,1679158211.0,Compliments on my body,"I‚Äôve been dating a guy for almost 3 months now and it‚Äôs been going pretty well, but I‚Äôm starting to have second thoughts. His actions definitely indicate interest and we see each other regularly. I really like him and I‚Äôve told him so on multiple occasions. He says he feels the same, but doesn‚Äôt seem to initiate any discussions about how he feels. I was the one who brought up not dating/sleeping with other people. He agreed to that but it was a short conversation. 

I‚Äôve noticed a pattern that is really bothering me. He compliments my appearance every time we see each other and is always saying how hot my body is, etc. but he doesn‚Äôt comment on how much he likes other stuff about me. He‚Äôs very affectionate when we‚Äôre together, though. I compliment him on things like being funny, sweet, easy to talk to, and I say how much I like spending time with him. The body compliments seem nice but they really bother me. Every guy I‚Äôve ever dated gushes about that aspect of me, and it makes me feel like they aren‚Äôt seeing everything else I have to offer and makes me feel insecure. I don‚Äôt know how to talk to him about this or if it‚Äôs even worth it. I feel like I‚Äôve really put myself out there and been vulnerable with my feelings and he‚Äôs not reciprocating. I wonder if appearance is just an easy thing to compliment because it doesn‚Äôt require making yourself vulnerable or showing feelings. 

Anyone have experience with this? Am I overreacting? I don‚Äôt know why the body compliments bother me so much.","I‚Äôve been there‚Ä¶ enough times for some themes to emerge:

1. Guy1 only complimented my appearance (face, overall appearance, body, etc) because even after a few months, he hadn‚Äôt bothered to get to know anything else about me. He didn‚Äôt appreciate my intelligence, sense of humor, etc, because he was literally unaware that those things existed. We lasted a few months because I kept thinking things would change. (They didn‚Äôt.)

2. Guy2 only complimented my appearance, despite the fact that he was aware of my other qualities, because he was very insecure about his own intelligence, sense of humor, etc.  (I know he was aware of my other qualities because he would brag about them to other people when it somehow benefited him to do so.) He wanted to be the smartest person in the relationship, and also the funniest, and also the whatever, and he just wanted me to be his silent, perfect accessory. We lasted about two months. 

3. Guy3 literally didn‚Äôt know he could/should compliment anything else about me, nor did he realize it was important to me to know that he liked me for more than shallow reasons.  This was pursuant to his previous gfs being extremely insecure about their own appearances and needing a lot of reassurance that he thought they were beautiful, had great bodies, etc. But I knew he was at least aware that I am intelligent (for example, he would tell *other* people how smart I am, would always laugh at my off-handed one-liners or anecdotes, and had no problem asking me to explain things like what caused the 2008 financial crisis or how federal jurisdiction works versus how state court jurisdiction works).  I told him how I felt, and he was shocked/horrified that I thought he only liked me for the way I look.  We lasted for over a year and broke up quite amicably consequent to me moving across the country for work.  

Minor variations on these themes have occurred multiple times over however many years I‚Äôve been dating (20?), but these are the three core concepts. 

All of which is to say, there are a lot of possible reasons why your guy only compliments your appearance. Look at the bigger picture and ask yourself if he shows that he appreciates your other qualities in subtle or indirect ways (e.g. by telling other people that you are such-and-such quality).  

Stipulating that I neither believe nor disbelieve this and am merely repeating what I‚Äôve been told and read‚Ä¶ more than one guy friend has indicated (and more than one study has revealed) that it‚Äôs not until about the third month that men start deciding whether they really like their partner as a person. Which is to say, the first 3 months, give or take, are primarily based on surface attraction, and that the deeper questions and assessments about compatibility don‚Äôt really come into play until (on average) that three month mark.   Again, **I am not stating this as a fact!** I‚Äôm merely throwing it out there as a discussion point for any men who feel comfortable weighing in! 

If you really like him, just tell him how you feel - you appreciate hearing that he is attracted to your appearance, but that you would like to know what else he likes about you/why he likes you beyond just surface attraction."

Just sorta had a mini talk about a day or two ago where she confirmed she is multidating. That's cool but she also confirmed that out of all the guys I'm currently very high up in the ranking. Cool again. Fast forward to today and I see her profiles gone from tinder, I think she deleted it. Should I bring this up or let it go?

datingoverthirty,11uoj6i,1679146147.0,The ex who won't go away,"I have a sticky ex -- we have lots of friends and connections in common and it is not possible to be a part of my friend group without seeing her. We also have some professional overlap. She is totally fine with all this, appears more than happy to still be friends, and has been receptive when I've expressed various boundaries I need. For my part, I don't mind being around her at all, that's not the problem -- we were friends before we dated, there was never anything about the friendship that didn't work. And it's not like I see her all the time. Just more often than I imagine a potential girlfriend would be comfortable with. 

Another way to put the problem: when I imagine my medium-term future, it's hard to imagine how she won't be there. Let's say I achieve my goal of buying a house: it's hard to imagine that I could plan events there like a housewarming party or hosting one of our sports nights without inviting her, as she is related to/close with most of my other friends and they do everything with her. It would be a big rupture in the group if I set a boundary there and would involve me missing out on a lot of time with them. My impression is that none of them see our continued friendship as weird. 

And the thing is, it doesn't feel weird to me either -- like I said, we were friends before dating, at this point we've been friends for longer than we dated (which was ~9 months), and all the reasons I originally enjoyed being her friend are still true. The reasons I think this is a problem are:

- my therapist seems to think it's a bad idea to still be friends with her, and he is often right. (On the other hand, he is oddly blithe about the possibility that this could harm my relationship with my other friends -- his view is that friends come and go and if I lose this group of friends I will simply make new ones. I can't manage to bring myself to think of it that way.) 

- I think it's likely any future girlfriend would be uncomfortable with it, and I completely understand that -- I would raise an eyebrow too if I learned that a girl's ex was part of her regular friend group.

I'd really prefer not to choose between finding a partner and keeping my friends. I used to be pretty friendless and my platonic social success over the last couple of years has been one of the best life changes I've ever made. While I would be happy to stop being friends with my ex, her close ties to the rest of my friends make me feel like that's not really up to me: I can't cut her out because they won't cut her out and I won't cut them out. But I'm still working to find a partner and I have a couple of promising prospects, and I'm worried the fact that I'm still friends with an ex will be a red flag. I'd be happy for any advice or reactions that people have.","I wouldn't be bothered if a guy I was seeing was still friends with someone he'd dated, in and of itself. It depends largely on their dynamic though. 

For example, I was seeing someone who was very codependent with his ex. He was her main mental health support (üôÑ) and she wasn't comfortable meeting or spending time with me. She would get jealous and upset of he wasn't available for her various crises and he would ask me guidance to support her. Nope. 

On the other hand I dated someone whose ex was folded into the friend group, which sounds similar to your situation. His ex was friendly and outgoing towards me and had moved on to date others. It was clear he kept good company and that reflected well on him, in my eyes.

Edit: Is your therapist older? This kind of sounds like the old-school realtionship advice from emotionally unavailable boomers."

datingoverthirty,11u615w,1679092145.0,Dating with Intention,"When I first started OLD, I didn't know exactly how to date with intention. But being on these platforms for six months, I've learned a lot about myself, what I don't want and want, and online dating as a whole. I was wondering what are questions you ask when you date with intention? I don't want to be overbearing with my questions but also want to make sure we're on the same page about things we're looking for. For me, I have a set of dealbreakers I screen for before we meet up. Very basic stuff (i.e. no smoking/drugs/etc.) and I own a dog and that they're okay with that. My friends who don't use OLD think I'm too serious and should just go have fun. I've been on these apps for awhile now, I'd like more productive dates and really would like to meet someone who I can share a future with (while having fun!) I also mentioned in previous posts, I think I have a pretty good profile now that reflects who I am. It shows the basic traits I want in a partner, my simple pleasures, my interests, I own a dog, and some of my core values.

I'm curious to hear what sort of questions everyone asks and how they go about deciding if the match is what they want. I'm looking for a life partner, someone who will be a good parent to my kids and share the same core values as me. The key thing for me is being family oriented, the other traits I'd like is caring, patient, down to earth... but primarily family oriented. Everything else, I can play it by the ear.

Thanks so much!","I‚Äôm in the same boat as you. My friends have also told me to have fun with it, but ‚Äúgoing with the flow‚Äù has usually met ignoring my own needs and allowing the guy to set the tone, which hasn‚Äôt worked out well.

datingoverthirty,11tiyyp,1679033756.0,Where are the men at planned events?,"So this has come up a few times among different friends in recent weeks. 

We all know it is great to meet people while doing things you already enjoy. But we never see many men out and about at events. 

To start - a few weeks ago I went on a bar crawl / fundraiser. There were around 40 participants. All women - save 2 men. One came with a partner. The other guy cleaned up - he had his pick of the entire crowd to flirt with. And he did - get talked to everyone and picked some favorites. 

A few weeks ago, a hip coffee shop had a speed dating event - open to all genders and sexual orientations. I saw the photos on their instagram. In a crowd of around 50 folks - i saw 2 men. 

This week I went to a concert in a mid-sized venue - Masego. While R&B concerts tend to skew female, it seems Masego is equally popular with men and women. This crowd? 75% women and I didn‚Äôt see any men not in a couple. Obviously I didn‚Äôt see everyone - i am sure there must have been some somewhere. But the section I was in - seated general admission, was overwhelmingly female. 

And I was traveling and hanging out with an old friend in NYC. She used to purposely go to all sorts of events to meet new people and prospective partners. She is burned out now - she has plenty of friends and there are not any prospective partners at these events. She is over it.  

I am also in a lot of Facebook / social media travel groups. And every time there is a group trip - the crowd is around 85% female. 

Anyway it seems like any straight men* who show up could have their pick of people to get to know - but they are MIA. What gives?  

There are posts here all the time about not being able to meet women. And the women are I out and about around town meeting each other because they are the only ones there. 

*it seems gay men go out a lot more often than their straight peers - at least in my circles.

NOTE: only one of these events were a singles thing. Everything else was just a random social outing - no singles or any angle. Just stuff I got tickets for to hang out with friends.","This depends heavily on geography. Where I live its the complete opposite. There are literally no women at any events because they will immediately be swarmed by single guys. I've watched it happen before, its very uncomfortable for them."

datingoverthirty,11taytr,1679011598.0,To have the sex talk or nah?,"Dating in your 30s is hard lol

Quick back story, I've been talking to this girl who's 10 years younger than me.  She used to live close and we knew of each other but then she moved to another state.  Over Thanksgiving we reconnected and have been texting ever since.  She visited over the Christmas holidays and we saw each other a few times and spent NYE together.  I traveled to see her a few weeks ago.  After each time we've seen each other we have the ""what are we doing talk"".  It's one of those where, we like each other a lot, but the long distance thing makes it complicated and hard to commit, but we also want to keep talking to each other.  So we keep it complicated lol.

I try to keep it classy.  We haven't had sex, or anything close, which I'm fine with.  While I was visiting her we did normal bf/gf stuff.  Hold hands, kissing in private and public, show affection etc.  Slept in the same bed cuddled up with each other... trying not to ""poke"" her lol.  Maybe some cup and cuddling when it came about but nothing more.  Again it's fine with me.  But I do find myself being somewhat anxious about it.  Questioning myself if I am missing a sign, if she's wondering why I'm note pushing the topic etc.  Then of course my peers asking/saying, "" you went all the way there and still nothing? Wtf""  

I plan on traveling to see here again and i'm wondering if I should just keep doing what I'm doing, leave it up to her to make a move or make one if I see the chance or try to bring the topic up to better understand her.  Should I bring it up via text a day or two before I go there, or wait and see how the trip goes then bring it up the day I leave or something?

I'm up for any suggestions or inside info on a woman's mind ha

Thanks

EDIT:  thanks for everyones comments.  I wont see her again for a month or so, so i have some time to decide how to proceed.  a few things to clear up:

from what I heard frmo a previous relationship of hers, they dated for 3 months and never did the deed.  But, I've also heard that she has had some sexcapades so I go with shes just selective, which is fair.

dont think im in the friendzone.  

to those who are saying ""you messed up"" or ""shes waiting on you"", don't think ive messed up, I'm trying to not be the sex crazed guy that she is probably used to as a girl in her 20's.  and based on our making out sessions, theres no indications that she wants to go past that.  

Thanks again, ill leave this up for a bid then take it down and will be sure to update after my next visit.","Every relationship is different, and I can't presume to know what she wants, but the majority of people who are in a relationship do have sex. If this is something you want, you should definitely make the first move. In my experience as a man, it is rare for the woman to make the first move. Of course, make sure that she is on board and consenting and you are not doing anything to make her feel uncomfortable."

Is this normal, how do you get around it, etc etc.",">*Is this normal, how do you get around it, etc etc.*

I think people being jerks in dating is normal, unfortunately

And you can't ask the trash to sort itself - like I'm not sure there's a way to somehow know which guys will be jerks ahead of time other than looking for cues (some guy following 300 cam girls on Instagram is probably not going to have nice expectations of women who don't look like that, but you probably won't have this info on the first date!).

I do think *acting* like you think you're hot shit, regardless of whether you *feel* that way, will sometimes discourage people from treating you as poorly. They might not stick around as a result because they know they can't rely on low self-esteem to get whatever it is they want.

 Trash will get into your pocket sometimes no matter how closely you guard your pockets, and once you find it there you just have to put it in the bin yourself. I did not intend for the pockets to appear like a metaphor for the vagina here to be clear."

We get roped into thinking that the apps are the only way to meet people, that if we just pay a little we'll get quality matches, that maybe swiping a little more or changing something in your profile will help. These things can be true but it feels like a losing game regardless. It becomes frustrating and depressing, especially as men typically get far fewer likes and matches than women.

I think there‚Äôs a hint of co-dependence in both of you going to therapy regarding this issue. You can‚Äôt solve this for her. Also, there is a risk to her, in having you provide and source a resolution. It prolongs dependence, in a time when she needs to learn how to manage this alone. That is the best outcome for her long term health. There is urgency here, it is an illness people die from every single day.

I hear you wanting to be supportive, but sometimes when it comes to mental health, that is through boundaries. I would suggest that she get a therapist, and you seek out your own. 

Your issue is going to be coping with her depression.

Her issue is going to be identifying the causes of her depression, and learning to cope through it in a way that isn‚Äôt self destructive.

You can work as a team to support each other through this, by separating out what each of you is responsible for, and learning how to manage your respective responsibilities when it comes to your independent mental and emotional health. This will be your best shot at creating a health stability between the two of you.

Sometimes distance, though it feels bad, is a very healthy aspect in which you each have the space to identify your roles. A relationship needs mutual giving and taking, but neither of you will be able to give to one another without giving to yourselves, first

It seems logical to do it when you reach the point where the benefits of the SO and kids knowing each other outweigh the risks. For those of you who have done this, how did you decide? 

I think my man and I have long-term potential, but I want to see how my BF does with my children before entangling our lives. It‚Äôs an important factor in determining whether we will work out long-term. 

Right now I coparent 50/50, so I only see my BF on my non-kid weeks. I‚Äôd like to see him more, and I think my kids might enjoy hanging out with him because he is warm, silly, and likes doing active things. I can imagine us having some fun times together.

Edit: Kids are 8 and 11.","One thing I would recommend you start doing (If you aren't already) is make sure your children know you're dating.  Start talking about him around the dinner table or when you're driving them to school or whatever your daily routine is with them.  

If the first time they hear about this guy is 2 weeks before they meet him it's going to be awkward no matter what.  You want to build anticipation, engage their curiosity.  They should feel like they already know him vicariously though you talking about him all the time.

Time wise?  Soon (if not already) any fear you have of the guy just up and vanishing will feel like an absurdity rather than a possibility.  Between that and your kids pestering you to meet up, it'll feel pretty natural at that point."

datingoverthirty,11rh4h8,1678842189.0,Late stage relationship anxiety?,"I‚Äôm not sure if this is typical but I‚Äôve noticed it happened in my last couple of relationships and I think it‚Äôs happening again.

In the beginning, everything is so carefree‚Ä¶ I feel really relaxed and I‚Äôm glad to just see where things go. I don‚Äôt have the thoughts of ‚Äúwill he call me?‚Äù ‚ÄúDoes he like me?‚Äù, etc.

But as things progress and get serious (like several months in), then I start to get those ‚Äúwhy hasn‚Äôt he called?, who else is he talking to?‚Äù kind of thoughts. I start second guessing where it‚Äôs going and what we‚Äôre doing. It‚Äôs almost like a switch gets turned and the relationship is no longer fun for me.

I‚Äôm really enjoying the person I‚Äôm seeing. He checks a lot of my boxes and I want to see where it goes long term. I called it off with my last ex and it took me a long time to get over it. I don‚Äôt want to ruin a good thing again but I‚Äôm just finding myself worrying a lot now.

Can anyone else relate?","This describes me too. 

I‚Äôve always had this fear that ‚Äúto know me more is to love me less‚Äù. Based on my dating experience in the past, men become fixated on me in the beginning (sometimes even alarmingly so), but then lose interest after a few months. Which messed with my head and made me believe there‚Äôs something wrong with me that you have to get past the surface to find. I was blissfully happy in the early stages of a relationship when men would make so much effort and show so much enthusiasm. But I always became worried after a few months as I could tell their enthusiasm was dwindling and I became paranoid that I couldn‚Äôt find a lasting relationship because I was always a disappointment to everyone once they knew me better. I was telling someone about that recently and they brought up a new point I hadn‚Äôt considered- the issue wasn‚Äôt about me. These men were all interested in the chase. 

I think if you encounter enough people who are just looking for the chase, it poisons your mind into thinking you aren‚Äôt desirable when the honeymoon period starts to fade. It creates anxiety. 

Don‚Äôt let yourself believe it. Trust that the right guy won‚Äôt leave, and feel thankful that the wrong ones always do."

Second date with a dude. It's a fuckton of fun. Night ends with him kissing me, which leads to 20 minutes of making out in my car before we part ways.

Today I've gotten a couple of rather half-assed texts, with no apparent intention of asking to go out again. 

I don't know what a successful date looks like anymore. I don't know how to navigate dating at this point. I'm looking forward to my imminent break from the apps, but I honestly feel like something has now broken within me, and I'm not going to be able to do this again. I just don't have the mindset to go on dates at this point when the accepted norm in the dating sphere is multi-dating, ghosting, and contradictory behavior, which you're meant to be strong enough to shrug off and go with the flow. I can't.

I've been sadboi a lot in the last year+ of giving it a solid, consistent try at dating, but I've *always* managed to get back on the apps at the end of it all. This time, I feel like a shell of the person I was. I had such high self-esteem and so much comfort and joy in who I'd become. The string of dating bullshit now has me questioning myself, down to the core of who I am. That's obviously not healthy.

Idk what I'm looking for by posting this, I guess just the listening ears of a group of folks who are most likely to understand what this feels like. I've officially been broken, my friends."
datingoverthirty,11rblu7,1678812943.0,Matching weeks/months later," I'm dealing with an injury right now that has left me homebound and unable to walk, so I've paused dating right now until I am healed and can get out again. I have noticed a few likes coming in on the apps from people I'd like to meet and I plan on matching and reaching out once I am able bodied. 

My question is, when matching weeks or months later, would it be too forward to just ask for an IRL date and mention we can chat more too if that is preferred? I also plan on adding a tidbit explaining my situation a bit and reasoning for the late match (or maybe that isn‚Äôt necessary?)

I‚Äôm the type that prefers in person and usually make plans if the conversation is flowing after a few days. Perhaps the eagerness in skipping the small talk is due to being cooped up for a long time now, and I can also see how someone would want to build text rapport first too. I usually find it is a mixed bag, some prefer no small talk and meet right away, while others want to chat and then do a call before meeting in person.

Maybe I just stick with the regular way of operating? I‚Äôd Like to get a female opinion on this, but all are welcomed, thanks.","I think it's better to not be on the apps if you can't meet now. In my personal experience if you reach out months later, most people aren't available anyway and it makes for a sort of awkward start because they're never quite sure if you're telling the truth or just out of a relationship and don't want to say it right away. 

And I don't quite follow, why are you planning to skip chatting?

Personally I need a bit of chatting to feel comfortable with meeting someone, especially because of the time involved - I don't usually do much else with an entire evening if I go on a date, versus a few minutes on my phone. Obviously it's harder to get a sense of people via texting but I've definitely had more lackluster meetups when I don't screen at all via text. 

But it's one of those things where ""to each their own"" - some people prefer meeting without talking and that's fine."

datingoverthirty,11qv7ah,1678764141.0,Would it turn you off if your date slept in a giant Hammock every night instead of a bed?,"When I was 26f, I had a giant handmade Mexican hammock in my bedroom that I would sleep in every night. Honestly, it was the best sleep I‚Äôve ever had and my body felt amazing. I had guests and the pairs of us would sleep through the night comfortably. My mom slept in it with me and loved it. I remember missing it after I eventually switched to a bed (not by choice).

I‚Äôm now 33f and am about to move into a place that has a super small bedroom. If I had a bed in there, it would take up the whole room. I remembered that one of my favorite things about my hammock was that I could easily unhook one side and clip it to the other, thereby taking up zero space when not in use. 

I started to get excited about getting another hammock. When I mentioned it to the person I was dating, they said ‚ÄúA hammock? OP,‚Ä¶you‚Äôre 33‚Äù and ‚ÄúWell *I‚Äôm* certainly not sleeping in a hammock‚Äù 
I said ‚ÄúCool. Your loss‚Äù.

But it did nag at me. On the one hand, fuck her for saying I‚Äôm too old to sleep in a hammock. 
But like‚Ä¶am I?

I guess I‚Äôm wondering how many women in their 30‚Äôs feel this way. My ex can‚Äôt be the only one. If you guys were on a date with a cool person and you went back to their‚Äôs, naturally expecting a bed, would you bail on them if you found out they had a hammock instead? 

I feel like a twin bed would be even worse. What‚Äôs your opinion?

I‚Äôm looking forward to hanging a hammock in that room so much. I miss the epic sleep I used to get, gently rocking with no pressure points. 

It really bums me out that she told me that because now I can‚Äôt let it go. I get that it‚Äôs easier to ‚Äúget away‚Äù with fringe stuff like that when you‚Äôre dating in your twenties. But is a hammock one of those cringy things? How do you guys feel? I‚Äôve been stressing about this way too much and I think hearing from you guys will help me out.

The issue is that while he says he really likes me, he is pretty lax with texting, making plans, and generally ‚Äúpursuing‚Äù me, during the time in which I thought the effort would be the highest. I don‚Äôt really feel valued or like a high priority, and I make an effort to make him a priority. 

I‚Äôm not waiting for him to initiate everything. I feel as though I‚Äôm investing more than him as it relates to communication and making plans because I‚Äôm naturally better at it.

Is this the type of thing that will improve as things progress and he gets more ‚Äúboyfriendy‚Äù over the next month or two, or if he‚Äôs not really meeting my needs now, should I cut it off because it‚Äôll stay the same or get worse? 

Curious about how things have unfolded for you in past relationships.","I know this so well ... 

A few things I've noticed that might help you

a) the reason why he is that way doesn't really matter. If you've already told him you need more and this is all he wants to give or is capable of at this point then it very likely won't get any better. People have very different needs and wants and all you need to know is that yours and his don't align. 

b) it usually gets worse after the bf/gf talk. Sometimes there are more dates but they feel like a chore because they don't really want to invest more time into your new relationship, they just feel obligated for a short while because now you're bf/gf. 

c) find someone who matches your energy level, needs and enthusiasm for a new relationship. I know it's hard, I'm in the same boat in a way but I did try to make a relationship work with someone who didn't match my style and it was horrible. I thought she didn't put any effort into our relationship because she was content with going on a date maybe once a month or less. She thought I was clingy and trying to control how she spent her time every time I tried to plan a date and asked for her opinion and availability, usually once a week. Once every other week was still too much for her and not enough for me. We both resented each other after only 6 months. Don't do this to yourself."

Part of me is understanding of the fact that we‚Äôre both still single and still getting to know each other.  The other part of me feels like it stings a bit and feels like perhaps I‚Äôm more interested in him than he is in me.  Which makes me want to pull away. 

How do you work on not letting it get to you while you‚Äôre still getting to know someone? I am genuinely curious about this.","‚Ä¶you‚Äôre still on the app too. Could he not be thinking the exact same things about you? 

But regardless, remind yourself that as you said *you are just getting to know each other.*

I know it can be hard not to take it personally, but I think too many people see dating as a competition of sorts. To me it‚Äôs about finding who you‚Äôre most compatible with. If a guy I like and I‚Äôm just getting to know ultimately goes on to feel he‚Äôs more compatible with someone else, that‚Äôs *okay.* Yes it might absolutely hurt! But that specific person being more compatible with someone else doesn‚Äôt mean there‚Äôs anything ‚Äúwrong‚Äù with me. It just means I‚Äôm not the right fit for *that specific person.*

And sure you like ‚Äúhim.‚Äù But at two dates you‚Äôve had such a teeny tiny glimpse into who he is as a person. There‚Äôs been a [couple of studies](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/exactly-how-many-hours-it-takes-to-create-lasting-friendship) done that estimate it takes about 40-60 hours of spending time with someone to even form a *causal* friendship. And about 200 hours before people consider someone a ‚Äúbest‚Äù friend.

That‚Äôs a reminder both that you don‚Äôt really know this guy and what he‚Äôs like, but also him not going all out on you yet *can‚Äôt* be personal because he doesn‚Äôt even know ‚Äúyou‚Äù yet!"

We had a nice date, but it wasn't really a super strong dating vibe. Normally, I don't really believe in needing ""the spark"" on first dates, especially brief ones, but we ultimately texted that it wasn't a perfect match. All good, it happens, it was still nice to hang out for an evening.





Well, she texts me shortly afterwards and says ""Would it be crazy if I set you up with my friend? I think you'd be perfect together."" I went with it because why not? We have been on a few dates now and she was right -- the friend checks all the boxes. It's a little different getting to know someone from scratch, with no dating profiles, prompts, or photos, so I'm maneuvering the unknown on a few topics. But all signs point towards this progressing, so hey, who knows where your OLD matches can take you??"
datingoverthirty,11pvpcd,1678669536.0,I tested my profiles in another state and was shocked by the results,"**tl;dr: I changed my location on my Hinge & Bumble profiles in NYC for 1 week and received 75 likes on Hinge and 70 on Bumble, after receiving 5 (FIVE) likes combined in an entire month where I live in Florida.**

I posted a profile review recently, made some revisions, but nothing had changed in terms of my results. A friend came up with the idea to switch my Hinge location to NYC to see if my results were any different in one of the biggest cities in the US. 

I was stunned to see the likes then just come pouring in. Apparently my alter ego in NYC could've been going on dates with multiple lawyers, doctors, and even someone who had a TedTalk with millions of views. In total, I got 145 likes in 7 days. What's more: I had the premium version of Hinge during my last few weeks in Florida. I let it lapse and so I was entirely on the free version in NY (I was on Bumble premium for both). So much for that theory about Hinge holding back matches until you pay.

Then I remembered that I don't live in NY and was stuck here in Florida. I was crossing fingers that the week in New York would at least boost my elo score for when I switched it back, but it's once again a ghost town on my profile.  Still not getting any likes (I did get 1 like this week from someone 10 years older than me haha) and my feeds are full of women I would not be interested in. How could I be so much more popular in one place but non-existent in another? 

I am still having trouble processing both ends of this: being popular in NY and invisible at home.  I almost would have rather gotten no likes in New York -- at least then I'd know I could make more changes. I honestly just don't know what to do next now. It feels like it's just time to delete the apps again.","New York has 8.5 million people and they're disproportionately young professionals. The entire state of Florida has 22 million people, and they're disproportionately retirees.

I think it's also worth pointing out that people who are new to a location seem to get an automatic boost in the apps so you might not be experiencing exactly what would happen if you lived in NYC.

NYC can also be a challenging place to date in other ways because it's an incredibly transient city, at least compared to other places. A lot of people come for a few years then leave so you might have a cornucopia of matches, but half of them want to move in the next few years to Denver, San Diego, their random hometown in WNY. And people might match because they can't tell where you are but realistically if you live in Brooklyn, someone in Harlem might not want to date you, or whatever whatever. (prob different boroughs than this, I'm just guessing.)

That said if you like the idea of a cornucopia of potential matches, NYC is prob the place to be"
datingoverthirty,11pqlu3,1678656949.0,Balancing honesty and feelings,"I'm not sure how to address this. I realized a girl I was seeing was involved in a situation I was uncomfortable with. I told her if we were only involved sexually it was none of my business, but if we were going to be together romanticly it had to go away. She was embarrassed and said she hadn't been in that situation since she found out all the details of it which weren't known to her prior.

One day she says she isn't quite sure how to handle ending it and I don't push, just say she can discuss it with me if she wants. Less than a week later she says he called her and says his life exploded and she says this is the perfect jumping off point for her and so the situation doesn't exist anymore. 

On social media I saw I was either blocked or her account was disabled. She said she disabled it because she was tired of alerts on a site she wasn't active on. Then I noticed the same from his account. I'm a pretty rational guy, in touch with my emotions and able to separate myself from my emotions when need be.

But I completely lost that ability as I imagined them both blocking me as a workaround to our situation. I had a friend check out their profiles to see if they truly deactivated them or if I was just blocked. They are both deactivated. 

I feel so dishonest for doing this. We started out because we were both willing to be so honest and vulnerable with each other and we developed a trust that I immediately violated. I want to tell her I did this. It will make me feel better. It will make her feel anywhere from neutral to crushed, and I have to realize her feelings need considered too. Honesty is the best policy 99% of the time, is this a 1% time where I carry the guilt without expressing it?

TLDR, I'm not smart enough to sum up this situation into 2 sentences.",I wouldn‚Äôt say anything. If you found out she was lying that would need to be a conversation but she was telling the truth so just take this is a lesson learned and maybe next time you won‚Äôt have to second guess.
datingoverthirty,11pkjn4,1678642783.0,I met a guy but‚Ä¶ I may be way in over my head!,"I (f31)haven‚Äôt been on a date since beginning of December because I had broken up with someone and still had some feelings and lots of regret about how things turned out. I still do but also decided to burn that bridge after bumping into him multiple times and him not showing me much interest.

However, Friday night I walked into a small bar with friends. There was only one guy (Let‚Äôs call him K (m31) sitting and talking with the bartender, I didn‚Äôt pay much attention to him tbh but I‚Äôll admit from the way he was dressed, he just looked a bit like one of those overconfident self-absorbed gym guys‚Ä¶ I am working on being less judgemental

Anyways we left the bar and one of our guy friends, let‚Äôs call him B, stayed behind and said he‚Äôd join us in a club later.

B came to the club with K, then B‚Äòs girlfriend joined us too. At some point, B‚Äòs girlfriend takes my hand and says ‚ÄûYou should hold K‚Äòs hand because he likes you‚Äú I was taken aback by this and just awkwardly starred at him for few seconds. We continued dancing but after a while I said I was going home. K asked if there is anything he could do to make me stay longer, I said no. As I was about to walk away I turned back and asked for his contact then I left.

Saturday, I contemplated whether to text him or not but ended up texting him about how nice it was to meet him etc. After few texts, he invites me to join him and his friends for a show later. I agreed but honestly wasn‚Äôt sure I wanted to but I was like WTF let me just go.

I went to the show, met his friends and everyone was nice and welcoming. It felt like we had known each for a while, everything was just natural. We even broke the touch barrier with holding hands and by the end of the night they wanted to go to more places but I don‚Äôt drink much, so I wanted to go home and sleep. He walked me to my taxi, I have never done this before but it felt natural to kiss him which I did. I had not felt that much chemistry with a guy in a long time and it helped that we didn‚Äôt meet on an app.

Then yesterday (Sunday) we spent the whole afternoon in a coffee shop just talking about everything under the sun. Nothing felt forced, even silent moments were not awkward. Safe to say everything went amazingly well buuuuut 

K is not a typical guy I‚Äôd go for. He is into metal music, has multiple piercings,lots of tattoos, all of which are minor compared to his sexual kinks. He is into kinky/ BDSM sex and my experience has been pretty vanilla. While I‚Äôm open to trying stuff when we do get into that point but I feel intimidated just thinking about it. I feel like he will either be disappointed, I may get hurt or both.

We shared a lot of common hobbies though and he open up about a lot of vulnerable topics which I love.

It‚Äôs still too early and although we talked a lot about sex as well a sexual health, we both agreed to take time to get to know each other first.

Anyways my question is, am I setting up myself for failure here or am I overthinking this too early?

Those into BDSM, how was it dealing with someone who had zero experience?","I'm not a BDSM person myself, but I have several friends who are. Most people who are into BDSM understand that it's not everyone's cup of tea. So when they date or have sexual encounters with people who aren't into it they're usually pretty patient and understanding. 

I guess the main thing is deciding for yourself if it's something you want to explore. If you do choose to explore it with him, make sure to communicate what your comfortable with trying, and exactly what your boundaries are. You may find that you enjoy it, or you may not. If you decide that it's something you're definitely not into, and he feels that's a deal breaker, then you may not be compatible. But if you decide that it's something you want to explore, you might find some thrilling new experiences."
datingoverthirty,11p7gdb,1678602555.0,"Girl very engaged and chatty during week, disappears at weekend","Been chatting to a girl online for just over 2 weeks now. I have noticed a pattern, during the week she replies fairly regularly and she is very very chatty and engaged. Turns out we have a lot in common, more than I have found in really... years I think.

After a few days of chatting I asked if I could take her for a drink and she said she would need to get to know me better before meeting, which I said was fine, and we kept chatting.

But I have now noticed a pattern where she will suddenly stop responding on Friday PMs and not respond again until Monday/Tuesday.

I really don't need excessive contact but I'm really keen to meet her because she's beautiful and shares so many interests, I really rarely find such a girl where I live, so I just want to know where I stand and hopefully meet and see how it goes.

My friends are divided between ""she has a bf she sees at the weekend"" and ""she's just busy or tries to avoid social media at the weekend"". She is definitely not a big social media users, never really posts stories or anything, but ""if they were interested they wouldn't wait days to reply"" is a phrase for a reason.

I have had similar situations with girls in the past and we ended up meeting and even dating so I'm not writing it off based on this but just wondering what people's thoughts are.","My take is that she's working and not doing as much during the week, and then doesn't check her apps while she's having fun on the weekend. Sounds completely normal.

You said you've had success in similar situations so I guess you keep doing you, but 2+ weeks without meeting means you're low priority. 2+ weeks is also plenty of time to chat and get more comfortable with someone. So you can decide whether she's genuinely still getting comfortable or she's just putting you on the back burner. Just don't tolerate behaviors simply because she's attractive and you think she's a great match... You haven't even met yet."

Found out later that she's allergic to cats, and my Hinge profile makes it clear I have a cat. She likely would have passed on me had her first introduction to me been my profile.

- sometimes people are just more attractive in person. I think I have good photos but they just don't convey some of the things that I think women find attractive about me. A past gf once told me one of the things she found most attractive about me was how comfortable and self-possessed I seem when I'm in a crowd of people. That's...highly specific, but it was a big part of what attracted her to me, and it's not the kind of thing that a photo is going to convey very well."

I'd look for compatibilities in the profile to make sure we'd align on key things.

The last man I went on a date with sort of ""trauma dumped"" about his childhood within a couple of hours (we spent the night together). I didn't really mind, I was glad he trusted me enough to share something that big with me. But I felt like it would be really inappropriate for me to share anything, even on a surface level, like it would look like I was trying to out-do his story. 

On our next date, I did share very surface-level, that I had some traumatic things happen to me as a kid as well, but didn't go into detail. I was gauging his reaction and tbh he didn't seem all that interested. He might have been just letting me share however much I was comfortable with, and that's fine. But I'm curious what others would do in this situation. How vulnerable would you get? For context, we are both in our mid-40s.

datingoverthirty,11m76g8,1678307309.0,How to know if I‚Äôm seeking out dates ‚Äúin my league‚Äù.,"Hi there! I (33f) have been surfing this sub for a while now, and have noticed a trend among the redditors offering up advice. Whenever an individual posts about feeling unattractive, and not being able to snag a date, I often read along the lines of: 

‚ÄúYou may be looking for guys out of your league.‚Äù

Or 

‚ÄúYou could be punching above your weight‚Äù

And 

‚ÄúTry lowering your standards.‚Äù

All of these statements can be rather polarizing! I believe that these serve as practical and  frank pieces of advice, as if you‚Äôre out there trying to find your person, you gotta have the chops for all the downer shit that comes with it. So it got me wondering about my own dating history, which happens to be a string of bad luck.

The men that I have crossed paths with, have been physically attractive to me, and I‚Äôm assuming the feeling was mutual. I do, however, wanted to mention that the last two men I was able to get the attention of were really REALLY good looking. So much to the point where I‚Äôd often catch myself wondering, *THIS guy is interested in ME‚Ä¶?!* but I still managed to hold their attention for a bit. 

But then to another person, my definition of gorgeous, may have just been ‚Äúeh he‚Äôs ok‚Äù. So that is where my curiosity comes into play. Now, we‚Äôre all aware that conventionally attractive people exist, but still, how does one know if they‚Äôre considered as so, or ‚Äúcan get‚Äù someone that many deem physically attractive? 

Or does this advice simply apply to someone who is humbly average and is only swiping on the Oscar Isaacs and Ana De Armas‚Äô of Hinge? 

I hope this is making sense. Basically, how do you know if you‚Äôre searching/dating within your league?","Keep in mind, men are willing to sleep with a much broader range than they‚Äôre willing to commit to.

Ideally, it would be when I feel that the other person is invested in me, but people realistically tend to have sex before that point.

I had been casually dating a divorcing man for six months when he had non consensual anal sex with me last November. He claimed to not remember it, and that ended our relationship.

After some time, I am back in the dating game‚Äîbut I‚Äôm struggling with what to disclose when and what to explain about my behavior. For example, I used to be pretty proactive when dating men‚Äîif I wanted to see them, I reached out‚Äîmy schedule is busy, so let‚Äôs get this on the books now rather than having it take three weeks for them to ask me out again. If I wasn‚Äôt interested but thought we could be friends, or genuinely was wholy uninterested , I said so. Now I feel like I just wait for men to take all the initiative, and will just face away if they don‚Äôt. I can‚Äôt envision a man responding well to a ‚Äúsorry, I‚Äôm not comfortable doing doggy style unless we are in a place of really caring for each other‚Äù early on without scaring them off or getting labeled as traumatized or unstable.

When I was a teenager, my gf of two years, wasn‚Äôt comfortable taking off her shirt or having her chest touched. We had sex, I saw everything else, never saw her without a shirt. I never asked of it was trauma, insecurity, something else. It was for her to decide if and when to tell me, and me to accept and respect that choice.

Prom night, we did the teenager thing and rented a hotel room so we could have a night to ourselves without parents that wasn‚Äôt the back seat of a car. She was wear this slight summery prom dress. She‚Äôd forgotten pjs. I had a tux, and hadn‚Äôt brought pjs either, so didn‚Äôt have a shirt for her to wear. I could see her panic. I asked what she wanted to do. She asked me to leave the room, so I did and when I came back she was under the covers, dress off. We were careful the whole night to keep covers over and I didn‚Äôt touch her chest.

After we broke up, we remained friends for awhile before drifting apart, as young people do. She never talked about it. I still don‚Äôt know. And it doesn‚Äôt matter. It was her choice."
datingoverthirty,11m3ujx,1678299841.0,Need sex advice for new relationship where guy is feeling insecure about hooking up.,"TL;DR: 
New relationship where we hooked up for the first time and he‚Äôs showing interest in every other area EXCEPT sex. He now says he doesn‚Äôt need sex that often and that he he‚Äôs intimidated by my experience. 

The Long Version:
I (36F) started dating (38M) and we recently became exclusive in that we aren‚Äôt dating/having sex with other people but aren‚Äôt BF/GF yet since we‚Äôve only known each other a month and we both want to take things slow. 

We had sex for the first time after the conversation about being exclusive and it was good, but a few awkward things happened that kept it from being great. I know the first time can be a little weird so it‚Äôs not a big deal, but now it‚Äôs been almost a week and he hasn‚Äôt even tried to hook up again even though he‚Äôs still texting, calling, and making plans together, so I know he‚Äôs still interested. We are seeing each other on Thursday, but he made a comment to me last night that we ‚Äúdon‚Äôt need to hook up every time we are together‚Äù, almost like he‚Äôs preemptively telling me he doesn‚Äôt want to hook up when we see each other which was disappointing because I thought we for sure would. 

We had talked about what we liked in bed a little before the initial hook up, and one of the things he shared is that he and his ex would have sex 3-4 times a week. He had told me a few other things about his preferences/past experiences, but it seemed like we may need to manage expectations a bit so we‚Äôve talked on the phone some this week and discussed sex a bit more (which is when he brought up not needing to hook up every time). He said he had a great time the other night but it sounds like he‚Äôs a bit insecure that I‚Äôm more experienced than him and he is afraid he can‚Äôt satisfy me in bed.

I don‚Äôt really know what to do with this information. I am fairly experienced because I really enjoy sex, but I‚Äôm VERY vanilla and almost all of my partners have been in relationships where we got to really know each other‚Äôs preferences. It didn‚Äôt happen overnight and learning how to satisfy the other person is part of the fun! But now it feels like he‚Äôs not wanting to have sex and I don‚Äôt know what to do next. He has reiterated several times he really likes me and that he is really happy with the relationship so far. 

Am I reading too much into this? Do I need to give him space until he is comfortable or just rip off the bandaid (with his consent) to try again? Will I be able to help guide him with what I like without it being blatantly obvious I‚Äôm coaching him based on previous sexual experiences that he‚Äôs already insecure about?

I know I need to have another conversation with him, so I‚Äôd just really like advice on how to approach this while respecting his boundaries, ensuring I advocate for my own needs, and don‚Äôt make any of his insecurities worse. 

Appreciate the help!","I think before jumping back in bed, it's worth having a real, vulnerable discussion with him about sex and insecurities. One of my mantras is ""to get vulnerability you need to give vulnerability"" and what I mean by this is if you want to have a particular conversation with them, instead of coming right out with what you want from them or asking them how they feel about a particular thing, open up and tell them about how you feel. This post is a great start


like I know we joke on here with ""you should show them this post"" but honestly, I think that is almost what's needed in this case. Talk about how sexual chemistry is something that you've built up on with previous partners and that it's a learning process for both of you. Talk about how you enjoy sex and you were a little disappointed about his ""we don't need to hook up every time"" comment. 

But also reiterate that you are exclusive with him and that you care about making things work. That you're not going to jump ship as soon as some imperfection pops up and that you're also learning about him and what he likes in the bedroom. Enthusiasm is much, much more important than technical skill imo because enthusiasm (also, enthusiasm about trying to work with the partner) shows that someone actually gives a shit


hopefully in introducing the topic in this way you can get him to be vulnerable about his insecurities in the bedroom. I would hope that the end result of this conversation is that you two not just able to learn about each other (sex drive, insecurities, etc.) but also just by having this not so easy conversation (being vulnerable is never easy but also worth it imo, sort of like exercising) you learn how to communicate and navigate through difficulties. 

also keep in mind that it might not go well. maybe you try to bring this up and he gets overly defensive or weird about it. while unfortunate, you will have learned that you two just aren't a match. but it's better to have a tough conversation and learn that about him then try to skate by on assumptions and hoping they pick up on vagueries

as long as you go into it with authenticity, understanding and compassion then there is no wrong way to have the conversation, frankly."

Seems like those I‚Äôve had the early on, great banter with are those who have in many cases, also fizzled the fastest.  Yes, they know how to communicate and have some funny questions and lines but maybe they just know what to say?
I‚Äôm also weary of the big ‚Äúspark‚Äù early on as I‚Äôve dated a few guys who almost had a formula for making one. 
I met a guy a little while ago who seems genuine and very kind and has a lot of the qualities I‚Äôm looking for in someone.  Our text conversation is not great (short) but in person, we seem to have lots to discuss and laugh about.  We don‚Äôt text every day and I‚Äôm okay with the cadence because we both seem pretty busy.  
Just wondering if you think banter = higher success for the best matches or if you‚Äôve found people to be better in person and the quality of text /conversation can grow once you get to know someone.","To me banter is separate from conversation. And I‚Äôve had excellent banter with folks where the conversation has been wanting. I‚Äôve had excellent conversation where there‚Äôs been hardly any banter. And everything in between.

To me it‚Äôs all just interpersonal dynamics. Some people bring (and draw out) different energies and as a result each connection can be different.

For me personally? I pay attention to whether I‚Äôm learning enough about them/they‚Äôre learning enough about me. I look for balance between playful and getting to know each other.

The extremes of no banter/poor conversation are things I actively eschew and will bail on.

Find out what you want/need and seek it. But know not everyone you have good banter with in person will show it over text first.
****

Put another way, banter is like a sauce or a side. It is not a meal unto itself nor can it sustain anything on its own.

But its importance to someone depends on how they like their meals."

I‚Äôm successful, have my own place, know what I want in dating and make my intentions known, etc. This has often resulted in me meeting guys who think this is all great until things start getting real (1-3 months), and the above is often their way of exiting the relationship. It hurts because I‚Äôve always, in all contexts, really admired these people and what they have going on, and it hurts to find out that they aren‚Äôt stoked to be dating someone they claim ‚Äúhas it all.‚Äù Being put on a pedestal like that also makes me feel like I‚Äôm not really being seen clearly as a complex human being.

I want to know how to get out of this cycle, and how common it is for everyone else on this sub. I can‚Äôt seem to get things right, so I‚Äôm taking a break from dating for the foreseeable future. I appreciate any insight.

EDIT 2: Since these topics have come up a lot I want to clarify that:

1. Often the men I‚Äôm referring to do come back around asking for a second chance, weeks or months after. I gave one a second chance last year, and he ended up pulling out again for the same reason. So I learned my lesson there.

2. I do not want kids, and I always let people know upfront that I am interested in monogamous partnership. The kid thing may be adding to some of the gendered dynamics people are referencing (‚ÄúMen want a woman who needs them / they want to feel needed and like the provider‚Äù). I usually tell men within the first date or two that I don‚Äôt want children, and this plus what I‚Äôm looking for are always listed on my OLD profile.","Just keep trying I guess.  The 3-7 month period is when most new relationships fall apart.  That's when it starts to get real and people get scared.  The easier, more comfortable thing to do is to run away.

I've experienced the same thing as you and I'm 40.  It doesn't get any better with age.  Older people of both genders do the same thing."

I'm looking for a long term relationship, and it's not in my nature to multi-date _or_ have sex before I form an emotional bond.. and that's just so NOT the online dating way (or maybe my friends are maximalists so I'm hearing skewed things haha).

What would you do? What has your experience been?","Just want to say this, as someone who feels this way, I feel your pain.  BUT I don't advise you to flat out mention your sex-pectations (or lacktherof). Why? Because some men will view it as a challenge and say the right things to have sex with you then bounce. 

I feel them out. I can tell which men are in it for sex and which ones would at least like to build a connection after some painful experiences. I think how they communicate with you, when and where dates take place. If a man mentions sex I mention that I'm looking for a certain connection, in some ways that might sound disingenuous because that connection is a relationship for me,  but men will usually see themselves out of that's a deal breaker."
datingoverthirty,11lgt11,1678235487.0,Does an awkward pre-date phone call ever lead to a good first date?,"So...I (34M) recently matched with someone (38F) on Hinge, we had a really nice exchange of text and voice messages, and she suggested we jump on the phone. So we did. I can only speak for myself, but the call felt pretty awkward. IMO, it's always somewhat awkward to talk on the phone before a first date, but this one felt cumbersome and lacking in life. There were no glaring red flags: just a palpable lack of phone chemistry. And yet, we ended up scheduling a first date, and I wonder if this was solely based on the initial attraction, intrigue, and strength of the earlier exchange we had.

In any event, I could see this going in any direction, and I'm curious if anyone else here has had the experience of an awkward pre-date phone call leading to a good first date. A phone call seems like a slightly better barometer for IRL chemistry then texting...but again, even phone calls with friends and family can be awkward sometimes.

I also appreciate a group picture later in the line up (clearly identifies who HE is) also a sucker for a random pic. One guy had a pic of him playing a guitar with a chicken perched on the handle. I swiped just to know more about that Pic. As far as prompts I like at least one that explains what they want in a partner/what they‚Äôre looking for and otherwise just fun, light hearted stuff.

Pics of a guy only in hats. As far as prompts anything too ‚Äúbro-ish‚Äù sounding or incellish/bigoted comments about women. Also too much seriousness in the prompts.

datingoverthirty,11la3ex,1678220405.0,Both being busy & unavailable - worth maintaining?,"Met someone online, chat for a week through texts before meeting, then we really seemed to connect. She gave me her number, had a great chat then she suggested a date. I picked the place, had a great time then called her a day after and she suggested another date that weekend. We ended up having 3 dates and multiple long calls in that same week.

Then comes a gap. I have my kids week on week off, so for the week I had them we couldn't go out. She doesn't like texting much so we only call now, but a very brief one in the week for an update. We both work full time. This week she said she's super busy with work, hasn't been able to go to her other classes after work (music, dance, gym) which she does most days for several hours after work. Doubtful if we'll be able to meet this week now

Next week I get my kids back so no dates again, then go will traveling. When I get back she'll be going on her trip for around a month. We're still fresh but I see lots of potential and do like her, but I have a feeling this big of a gap for close to 2 months will cool things off and we'll end up drifting.

Calling may be difficult too being in different countries and time zones, and maybe too needy to ask for check ins while traveling, especially this early on?

Suggestions or thoughts on what to do?",I think before worrying about calling in different countries you need to decide if this person is compatible *right now*. Personally I‚Äôd find it very very hard to get off the ground with all the space and traveling right off the bat. Is she always this busy? Will she be able to deal with your custody schedule? Maybe you should think about the reality of the time you guys are available and have a chat?
datingoverthirty,11l33w1,1678204778.0,Pointing out flaws in things your match likes - why?,"Looking for other perspectives on a situation that‚Äôs come up a few times now with new matches.

I match with someone and we‚Äôre still feeling each other out in the first few messages. Then something like this happens:

- Them: What sort of tv shows do you like?
- Me: I‚Äôve been watching Battlestar Gallactica. Its one of my favorite and I really like (*something about the 2000s reboot*)!
- Them: Oh, you like the reboot? There were so many plot holes but it was OK. I liked the original more.

In my opinion, I think if you don‚Äôt have anything nice to say, don‚Äôt say it at all in this stage. Why not just say ‚ÄúI liked the originals more‚Äù and try to find common ground instead? Or just not reply if my taste in shows/movies/cooking/whatever bugs you?

It‚Äôs fine to disagree. And it‚Äôs different when it‚Äôs a close friend or partner you trust who jokes around with you about those things sometimes (*honey I love you but your taste in shows is bonkers*). But why bring that kind of combative attitude to a stranger you‚Äôre trying to connect with?

*Update: Based on comments, here‚Äôs another example from a different recent match that‚Äôs more over the top. I am a woman, he is a man.*

- Him: What are you doing this weekend?
- Me: I‚Äôm getting together with my friends for a philosophy discussion! Last time we talked about (two topics) and it was a lot of fun. How about you?
- Him: Lol (topics) sounds dumb. That‚Äôs not even real philosophy.

I did not reply to that person. I did reply to the person in the first example.","Someone who is overly negative is exhausting, to be sure. But in this case, at least the way you wrote it, it sounds like someone just innocuously expressing an opinion. It feels like a weirdly high standard to expect someone to find the exact right proactively respectful language when you disagree about pop culture. 

However, if this person is consistently shitting on the things that you like, it might just be that they're a contrarian or deeply cynical, and I certainly wouldn't enjoy being around them in that case."

datingoverthirty,11klmdb,1678154216.0,How should I approach this?,"

I am a 32-year-old male teacher. It's been hard for me to get back into the dating field after a long-term relationship ended over a year ago. It took me more time to process everything, but I'm finally reaching a point where I'm ready to start dating again. There is a female custodian on the night shift at my school. She's in her late twenties and is going to school during the day for nursing. I usually stay late, and we end up chit-chatting a lot.  I've since added her on Facebook. It feels like there's a mutual connection between us and maybe even a little bit of chemistry. I don't want to jump into anything too serious immediately, but I've considered asking her out.

It's been a while since I've been in this position. Is this ethical? I'm a teacher. She's a custodian, so there's not much of a power dynamic. We've talked enough that I don't believe she currently has a boyfriend. Does anyone have any advice on how to ask her out without making things awkward? We work at the same school and still have to see each other even if she rejects me. I would love to hear what you think. Thank you!",[deleted]
datingoverthirty,11kbdha,1678131236.0,Question about religion and dating,"Had a date this past weekend and I did enjoy talking to her. One thing that stood was her numerous questions on religion.  She asked if I was religious and I said no but I have gone to nearby church before (truth). She then asked if my parents are religious and I said no since when they were young back in asia, religion (Christianity) wasn't really a thing. 

Then after end of date I said I would love to meet her again and she took a 20 second pause where it was awkward since we were just standing outdoor. She then asked me ""what is the name of the church you go to?"" and I gave her a name - I know she doesn't go to the church i went to since she goes to a Korean church and I went to a Chinese church.  Then she thought about another good 10 seconds before asking for my number to connect.

So I don't have anything against religion and am ok with converting or going to church, will this be an ongoing topic on future dates and is there anything I should expect in terms of dating etiquette?(kissing etc.). 

&#x200B;

I didn't lie about going to church and when I did attend, I did like the stories that were told in reference to the verses, maybe not too much the singing...","If you're not particularly religious, and she seems to be strongly so, and it's a centerpoint of her life on a first date...that sounds frankly like incompatibility. Especially if you feel like you need to stretch the truth to convince her that you're religious ""enough"" for her requirements.

I'm not religious, so whilst I've dated women of various religions in the past, they weren't *religious* about it, and it was a very minor/background part of their life. Not something they'd want to discuss a dozen times on a first date, or demanding to know the names of a church I used to go to. That just sounds like a major incompatibility for me, so I wouldn't bother trying to get a second (likely awkwardly painful) date out of them."
datingoverthirty,11k1ga9,1678115581.0,‚ÄúHow do you feel about being friends first‚Äù,"Question is: should i cut my losses and move on

Those dreaded words everyone fears to hear. I have been talking with her for a couple months now. Because of work, shes been living in multiple states out of her suitcase since we ve been talking. From a big picture goal, we seem to want the same things, have the same hobbies, similar personality types. We talked about long term relationships at the beginning. Kicker is shes going to be moving in 1.5 years and has no idea where she will be moving to because it depends on where she gets her next job but it is certain this job is not offered in the state we are living. But she will be returning to our current state after a year at this temporary job. 

I can feel her pulling back a little bit when we met and she asked if we can be friends first before committing. Previously we met had a really great date ended with us making out so kinda mixed signals. Normally i would say no im not in the market for a waffling wait and see game. But this is a weird situation because its the smart move on her end and i understand shes trying to feel ‚Äúis this something im ready to invest in given that i will be moving away for a year in 1.5y time.‚Äù This along with her working something like 80+ hours and 24hour shifts every 3-4 days in a new city every other mo (last temp move ends this mo and she will be back here for a while) makes this a weird complicated social dynamic. I understand because shes still in medical training and i just finished my medical training so i know exactly what its like. 

I understand there will always be other compatible ppl but im kinda tired of the whole getting to know someone from the ground up over and over again only to be disappointed because either i or other person isnt feeling it. Not sure if i should just stick with it and see.","I mean, you need to do you, but if I were in your shoes, I'd wish her the best and move on.  She's moving away, she's unwilling to commit and she seems so damn busy I have to wonder if you actually get to spend much time with her?  You can be endlessly compatible in many areas, but if one of you isn't actually \*available\* for the other person, compatibility means nothing.  You are worried about the disappointment of having to find someone else while you bath in the disappointment of this ""relationship."""

When we broke up back then I was devastated, eventually got over it and have matured quite a bit over the last few years as a person - more calm, centred and overall happier.

Anyway, so we went out a few times and spent 1-2 nights together (just cuddling, making out and some more - no PIV sex yet). But NOTHING has changed with him, he‚Äôs still flaky AF and ‚Äúfiguring his shit out‚Äù, which still disappoints/annoys me despite the work I‚Äôve done on myself. 

Even before dating again I told him that he‚Äôs starting from below 0 and has to make up for a lot of hurt. While that‚Äôs easier to say, I couldn‚Äôt follow through because, oh god, I am insanely attracted to him. Like the sexual attraction is seriously clouding my judgement.

So, I want to get this guy out of my system, I‚Äôve had a few dates with others and they‚Äôve been good but I just get very excited about this one whenever he texts or calls and I find my resolve dissolving.

I seem to be exclusively attracted to social extroverts who use me for attention but never want a relationship. I am an introvert that has tried very hard all my life to overcome this disease (this is hyperbole in description but it honestly feels like a disease at times). I am finding this is futile though and I always get left becasue I'm not always talking or cracking witty jokes. There's never chemistry because it seems I can't provide social security. Really hoping for some input on how to change.,"As usual, people are confusing extroversion/introversion with social aptitude. 

Extroverts like people time and feel recharged by it. Introverts need a break from people because it can feel draining when they hit their limit. 

Shyness, outgoingness, and sociability have nothing to do with introversion or extroversion. 

Introversion is not a disease. And some introverts are outgoing. You can learn to improve your social skills as it sounds like that is your issues. But you still will possibly feel drained by spending too much time with people. 

It sounds like you are attracted to these charismatic folks (who may or may not be extroverted) because you feel like you lack charisma. You need to work on getting more comfortable with people and your self esteem."
datingoverthirty,11j08b5,1678031393.0,Am I just being cynical?,"Is it just me? Am I being unreasonable to think this just gives me ""the ick""? Are women really accepting this as the norm, even when intentions were made crystal clear?

I've been speaking with a man for one week, we have met three times - he's eager but it was feeling very low pressure and we have had discussions about what we were both looking for, dating style, communication style, etc. We appeared to be on the same page, he wasn't just telling me the same things after I said them, he said the same things I thought before knowing what I wanted. We discussed what we were looking for both before we met and since. We were both clear we weren't jumping into anything and would take our time to get to know each other before being intimate at all.  I was clear I don't want to sleep with anyone unless we have genuinely gotten to know each other and are on the same page about what we are looking for, etc. He is quite interested in me and making it known. 

Date one was probably two days into us talking; he drove to me in my city and took me for dinner. We live about 45 mins away from each other at decent traffic times. Dinner went well, there was no kiss or anything, it felt all very refreshing. 
The next day I was working from a coffee shop, and he suggested he come out and see me for a little break in the day. He came to me in the town over, another say 10 minutes further for him.. again, it went well. It was feeling very refreshing, to see effort, to be chatting with someone on the same page, and to know he has his shit together. Afterward, he said he had wanted to kiss me, I told him I wouldn't have stopped him. 
We met a third time, which truthfully felt like too much for week one of talking, I'm pretty busy this week, but I squeezed it in, we went for another dinner, I was on the road that day so I went to him this time. Everything was going smoothly, the date was nice.

He does have a problem with interrupting it seems, and changing the conversation to him and a related story about him, without letting the other person finish, which is where some apprehension came in. I asked if anyone has ever mentioned he interrupts people a lot, he said no, apologized, and said he would work on it.

Throughout, he has been communicative that he is very interested, wants to put in effort, and is wanting to get to know each other better before hopping into bed.

Then last night he says, and I quote, ""I'd suggest letting me come visit you. But you would have to agree to alot of making out and not wearing pants ü§£ to make it worth the drive""


Like.. to literally be a grown ass man and tell a woman you're only worthwhile if your pants are off? I just don't find this funny or endearing or cute... 

I can't tell if I'm being cynical and overreacting by not wanting to reply ever again to this man I've just met... but my gut definitely tells me he was saying what he thought I wanted to hear to get in my pants. 

Is this really just the norm now? I'm exxxxhhhaaaausted.

Edit to add this information that I replied in one of the comments:

Another ick moment lol... he works 4 on and 4 off, and was asking what I had time for. I have some major work events this week, and my business is taking off in ways I never imagined (literally just last week, very unexpectedly), so I'm heeeectic busy right now. We hadn't made any plans yet and he said he was going to do xyz if I was going to blow him off.. I asked if he expected me to keep his days off open and he elaborated that if I wasn't going to see him he was doing something else.

I don't bail on plans or blow people off, but you haven't actually made any plans with me. He called me bossy, I replied ""what?""..  all of it seemed childish, and... controlling? Manipulative?

He'll do nice things for me sometimes, and when I tell him when he's being mean, he says he's not because he's done things for me and if he was mean he wouldn't.

Of all the things he's said to me, the lies he's told, the names he's called me, the way he's made me feel like I'll never measure up...hurting me like this is the worst. 

I didn't even realize how bad it's made me feel until I wrote it down yesterday. I had still been texting with him here and there. But today, I haven't responded to him.

Yes, I know this is normal, but it‚Äôs still messing with my head for some reason. 

On one hand, it‚Äôs affirming why I haven‚Äôt tried dating in about 6 months now. It validates my decision that I‚Äôm better off alone and allows me to continue to be lazy and not try to meet new people. That‚Äôs not a good thing. 

On the other hand, I am trying to convince myself to start dating again (hence why I frequent this sub), and seeing how all of these couples are ending things after years worth of commitment is really depressing and not particularly encouraging to me.

datingoverthirty,11hafah,1677867981.0,Profile Review! Looking for quality>quantity and people that match where I'm at in my life,"**UPDATE: Thank you all for your feedback, kind comments, and tough critique. I've taken down the links b/c I think I got the input I needed.The consensus was to change up my photos and modify my prompts to be more personal, vulnerable, real, and fun.**

A couple of thoughts while I have the room:

* I don't ascribe to the narrative that a strong ambitious woman is emasculating or unattractive to similarly ambitious men. All my girlfriends are killing it with their respective partners, I'm probably one of the last single ladies standing. Still I agree that my profile needed to show more of my personality and what I value in a partnership, outside of my ambition.

&#x200B;

* The world is different for successful women of color, including myself. Two things I didn't share is that I bust my ass to get where I am and climbed professional ladders that were never intended for me. There is no fallback, I only have myself.  Y'all want soft women, but society has made it hard for us. My work is more than just a job and paycheck, I'm trying to solve social problems and teach future leaders so that the world is a little better for communities like mine. I hope a future partner celebrates my journey and career goals, it's part of who I am and what make me tick. If they don't care, or it's not important, or if its intimidating, then they aren't the one for me. If you think I'm intense, you should meet my mom, tias, and cousins who are the matriarchs of their families-- the stereotype that Latina women are passive is wildly inaccurate.

&#x200B;

* I'm a normal person, I go to the grocery store and Target and have too much laundry waiting to be washed and my car needs an oil change. But I also want to feel like I'm living my life to the fullest, if I go out tomorrow my obit should read ""she lived her damn life."" I'm not competing with friends or other women. See above about experiencing life as a woman of color, my ancestors and I didn't do all this just to let life pass me by. The crumbling pressure of capitalism and life in the US takes away our magic, we often only have the energy to get from work-to-home but I refuse-- I hope you refuse too in whatever way that looks for you. My new profile will hopefully attract a person with this same energy.

I hope this gives you insight on the intense women in your life and who you come across in the apps. We're batshit but we're amazing.

I've been on Hinge for about 5-6mos after getting out of a longish relationship. It's rough out here and looking for feedback!

I get consistent hits on my Hinge profile (anywhere from 2-10 likes a day and consistent conversations) but I'm a little underwhelmed by my matches. I think everyone deserves partnership but most of my matches just don't seem as interesting, attractive, or as successful as where I'm at in my life (e.g. guy with photos of bottles at a club/in front of cars or; construction worker with a super bland profile and bad pics). Most of my messages, with clever openers or questions, to people who I do think would be better fits are unreturned. Lots of first dates are also pretty lackluster, nice people but few spark my curiosity or romantic vibes.

I am a confident person, I know what's for me will come but I am also busy and want to live my live, rather than swiping and messaging everyday. I'll date any race/ethnicity . I think I'm good looking and carry myself well, but not skinny/blonde/white. Similarly, I'm pretty flexible on height and body type, I'm attracted to confident men even if they don't fit society's standard of male attractiveness. An educated, career-stable, well-rounded person is important to me. I sound pretty intense here but I'm fun and love to laugh at myself and generally be a goof, while also working towards my goals and living life to the fullest.

Thanks for your feedback on my journey for love and a dog-dad for my fatherless puppy.

datingoverthirty,11h4vcu,1677860680.0,Dating App Prompts are Boring (a creative writing exercise),"So we all know the bios and prompts on online apps are incredibly boring.

I thought it might be fun, just as an experiment, to post three true things about yourself that you think are unusual or noteworthy. Don't try to sell yourself to another person or use this as an opportunity to get deep (though feel free if you want), but just share three things you think people are unlikely to see from other people on an app! 

Example 

\--I grew up on a farm and know a lot about carpentry, vegetation, and taking care of animals

\--I own 150 BoardGames and like to read the rulebooks in the evening to relax

\--I sleep through my alarm once (and only once) every year. It's uncanny!","I literally found my violin teacher on the street - he was busking and I asked if he knew of any teachers

I've been to all countries that start with J

datingoverthirty,11h0use,1677850294.0,"After a bad breakup 4 months ago, I feel like I can't form a romantic emotional connection...","Does it just take time? This didn't happen to me after my divorce because I was able to connect emotionally to the person who became my recent ex. I don't understand it, I meet some lovely people that I connect with on many levels but I feel like if they dropped me today I'd shrug my shoulders and move on. This doesn't feel normal and I don't know how I will ever get a new partner. (My last partner basically discarded me so I feel like this is some emotional defence mechanism but I don't know what to do about it).",It‚Äôs perfectly normal. It takes time to heal properly and being okay with your own situation. 4 months isn‚Äôt enough time and you are okay with it. It will take a year. Personally I would take this time to develop good traits for yourself. Ask yourself what do you want in a partner. What do you want in the next relationship? Are you ready to love again or just date and be happy? But this takes some time.
datingoverthirty,11gxwhu,1677841369.0,How can I work on self-respect and self worth?,"I've been doing ok in my 20s, in stable relationships with ""nice men"", but at 28 I ended up in an emotionally abusive relationship. Since then, it's been a string of abusers, one worse than the previous one (it happened a couple of times). Each time, I share with a new guy how I've been mistreated before, they are sympathetic and act horrified, then a few months later down the line they proceed to treat me even worse. 

My last partner was the worst person I've ever met (see post history), and yet I find it very challenging to maintain no contact and still feel the addictive pull of trauma bond. I tell myself: the person who's been physically abusive towards you doesn't deserve you, the person who screams and name calls regularly is not the one... I know it all rationally but memories of what a respectful relationship looks like are so blurry. This is all i know now.

I have a support system around me, in therapy and started attending support group meetings. I feel that I'm doing everything but my brain struggles to get the message that I deserve to be respected, appreciated and valued in a relationship. 

How else can I work on this? 

I know there is no point to try dating until I reprogram beliefs about what I deserve and what I will not tolerate any longer.","Having been there, I would say you've pretty much nailed it.  It's even better that you have a support system. 


1. Moving forward, make a conscious effort to not project your past experiences on other men you may meet. 

2. Stand firm on your non-negotiables. Define how to want to feel in a relationship and if the feels don't align, immediately move forward.  

3. Don't ignore red flags. Acknowledge yellow ones. 

4. Don't settle. You may come across three more men in a row like this, but that does not mean that's what you're worth or what you deserve."
datingoverthirty,11grrz5,1677819447.0,How would you handle this kind of situation when meeting people in person?,"I recently went alone to a live music event. Some folks were hanging out by the bar prior to the show starting up, myself included. This guy walks up to me and we begin chatting. I was really enjoying our interaction and feeling some chemistry when out of nowhere, random guy number 2 rolls up. He inserts himself into the convo, and proceeds to latch himself onto me like a freaking barnacle for the remainder of the night. Meanwhile, guy number 1 leaves shortly before the show begins, because as it turns out he was one of the band members (so humble of him to not even mention it amiright?). I had to spend the whole evening trying to get rid of this other guy. Multiple times, I said things like, ""have a nice evening, I'm off to do XYZ (go to the bathroom, get another drink, stand in another area, etc)"". He would leave me be while I went away thankfully, but as soon as I was back to the main show floor, he'd find me again and start talking. I even explained to him that I really love this band and wanted to focus on the show but he just kept talking anyway. He hovered near me until after the show was over and asked if I wanted to go to another bar with him. I said no, and then rushed to my car a few blocks away, praying he wouldn't follow me. He didn't come across as scary, just very socially inept and unable to pick up on my strongly disinterested cues.

* I was super annoyed that weird guy #2 ruined my moment with band member dude #1. This other woman at the show even said that #1 was glancing my way all evening. What could I have done differently in that moment when guy #2 interrupted us?
* I was super annoyed that weird guy #2 wouldn't leave me alone. But I also realize it's partly my fault. I really struggle with trying to be kind with everyone and I know I probably should have asserted myself more to make it super clear I wasn't interested. But I just don't know how to do that. Any advice?

Edit: Sorry everyone, I posted and then fell asleep üòÖ Catching up on comments now

datingoverthirty,11g9wtl,1677781525.0,How best to end this 2 month thing - text or call?,"I (M44) have been seeing (F43) for 8 weeks. This has been maybe 10-12 dates, texting every day from the beginning and even before meeting (she's a big texter), and we've been sleeping together from date 2. While not addressing it directly, she has been putting out the feelers for exclusivity over the last few dates, on our last date telling me she had deleted her dating apps. I skirted round the issue and did not deal with it directly but I don't think that's fair. I wanted to give this relationship time to work out but unfortunately, I don't think my feelings are such that I see us working out long term.

We never talked about relationship goals but I came into this looking for something serious. I have a history of avoidant behavior (which I am working hard to change) and have killed previous relationships much earlier without giving them the space and effort on my part for them to potentially grow into something. So I am trying not to do that going forward. I feel like I have given this the honest space and effort for my feelings to form but unfortunately, I am not there and don't think I will be. Also, I've previously let versions of these types of budding relationships turn into longer situationships, where my head and heart were not really in it and which could have been ended much earlier and with considerably less hurt feelings on the other end. I don't want this to happen here as she is a really nice person and I don't want to suck her in further when I know now that my feelings are unlikely to change.

We were due to meet on Sunday but I don't think it's a great idea for her to think she's coming on a fun date only to be hit with this news. I want to reach out to her today but am torn between a long text with the option for me to call her if she'd like to talk. Or just a straight up call. Or even an in person meet up. I'll add that we have never actually called each other - frequent daily texting has been our sole method of communication. If you were her, how would you like to receive this message? Thanks all.

\---------------------------------

Update / thoughts (apologies for the length)

Thanks to the majority who commented in a constructive manner. But quite honestly, I did not expect the level of hate, blame and shame flying around in a decent chunk of the comments below (thanks to the mods for removing the most vitriolic and unhinged ones). I have been called 'scum', a 'user', that I was only ‚Äòin this for one thing‚Äô, that I 'got what I wanted', am 'horrible and selfish' a 'sanctimonious a-hole' and that I 'was never into this woman to begin with‚Äô (thanks for thinking you can read my mind). Ultimately, this was a straightforward situation where I liked this woman at the beginning, decided I was going to make a proper go of it, gave it the time, energy and care it deserved (have not slept with anyone else during this time), before ultimately concluding that this is not a good fit for the long term and it's unfair on her to continue any longer. She told me she deleted her dating apps two dates ago but made no demands and said nothing more. She actually said that I could keep seeing other people (should have mentioned that above). This was kind of in passing and we‚Äôd had a few drinks at this stage so I did not address it there and then. Needed time to think, especially to consider if I was ending it simply due to my previous avoidant tendencies. You can‚Äôt make a decision like that on the spot or even overnight. That‚Äôs not fair on her or the relationship, is it? In the week that followed, I reflected on it and saw her once more where I thought about telling her but still hadn't completely decided on what I wanted. Now I have.

To the folks saying I have been stringing her along since the dating app thing, we‚Äôve only slept together once since then and isn't somebody allowed a little time to reflect on what they really want? Don't all relationships move to higher stages when one or both communicate that they want to step it up? This is what's happening here. It's only been seven weeks! We don't fully know each other and in my mind, this is a very normal and healthy stage in a relationship to be having a talk about whether or not both parties are ready to take it to the next level. In this case, one of them just happens not to be. That's life. Isn‚Äôt that how healthy relationships are supposed to go? Do you think nobody gets hurt and everyone is supposed to live happily ever after? Do you think it would have been better for me to bail earlier so that she would not get hurt, even though I was still fully engaged and wanted to move it forward at that point? Do you think I'm somehow obligated to hang in there now just because we had sex and I should not hurt this person? Do you think that not having sex until later would have somehow made me commit to her? Some of the comments are baffling.

On having the DTR earlier. Maybe we should. But we are grown adults and neither of us decided on that until date 7 when she mentioned the apps (on reflection, we are 8 dates in at this point). But even if we did have the convo earlier like date 2/3, I would have said that I wanted something long term (I did) and we would have continued along before inevitably getting to the same point we‚Äôre currently at. So it would not have made one bit of difference.

Also, the level of knee jerk hypocrisy in a minority of the comments has been really eye opening. Everyone rushing to second guess my motives when if it was a woman in my place that ended a relationship at date 8 and after sex had occurred (happens literally all the time and to me more times than I can count) then do you think she would be accused of somehow ‚Äòusing‚Äô the guy as I am being here? Absolutely not.

On the avoidant thing. I‚Äôm also surprised at the level of second guessing and rush to blame here. The negative commenters simply refuse to look at the facts of what happened and are sure this is the avoidant me with the same problems. Do you know how avoidant me would have handled this six months ago? I would have either bailed after date 2/3 when I felt like I could potentially cop feels for this person and there‚Äôs the possibility I could get hurt. And when I say bailed, I‚Äôd have just faded her out or made her end it through my overt show of disinterest, like I essentially did with the woman in my previous post 6 months ago. Alternatively, if I‚Äôd got to this stage at date 8 and now decided that I was no longer into her, then I likely would have kept seeing her because it‚Äôs still fun and it does not look like she has any plan to place demands on defining the relationship at least for now. Then I would have bailed at month 4/5, again by just fading or pissing her off such that she ended it for me. I certainly would not be doing what I am doing now, ie proactively communicating and ending something pretty much as soon as I don‚Äôt see a future in it. Isn‚Äôt this the opposite of what avoidants do? That is, proactively engaging with difficult conversations instead of pulling away or ghosting? I don‚Äôt care what any of the negative comments say, it‚Äôs clear to me at least, that I am making good progress.

I texted her that I picked up on the dating app thing and that we need to talk, asked if she wanted to talk on the phone or meet up, and we will meet tomorrow for a chat (not a date). Also, texting has been much less frequent this week and maybe/hopefully she has sensed it and got a heads up to prepare. Thanks to everyone for the constructive advice.","You never discussed relationship goals before? Why was it a surprise that after sleeping with her, messaging daily, and having about a dozen dates that she would be thinking to date you exclusively? I think she‚Äôs going to feel used by this experience. It just sounds kind of cruddy imo because you‚Äôre basically dumping her for asking for exclusivity as soon as she‚Äôs started to feel attached and safe enough to delete her apps. If she initially said she wanted short term then maybe I can see why the change up would rattle you, but if you‚Äôre texting every day, that doesn‚Äôt seem very casual. In the future, please be upfront that you aren‚Äôt looking for long term dating or exclusivity. If that is what you want, end things when *you* know that‚Äôs not possible not when she deletes her apps or it comes off like you strung her along for your own convenience. 

Anyway, you should call her."

datingoverthirty,11g51ni,1677769733.0,Feeling like I'll (32F) never be in a relationship because I can't picture myself being loved.,"Good afternoon all,

I (32F) rejoined the world of OLD after a long break courtesy of Covid. Prior to Covid I'd had several dates, but only 2 serious relationships, both of which ended via ghosting. I recognise I am very emotionally scarred from the experiences. 

I recently matched with someone who seems nice, not terribly physically attractive to me, but okay. Previously, I'd only matched with people that I thought were very physically attractive to me, but I decided that my matching criteria was obviously flawed given my failures in meeting people I'd want to date, and the eventual poor decisions of the people I did date. 

We've spoken a fair bit, he sends me lots of messages in the days since we matched, and he's asked me to dinner which I've agreed to (that's happening in a few days time). I've passingly mentioned I'll send him art that I like in the mean time until we meet, or agree to the video calls he wants to do. Because of my work and personal (and family) health circumstances I wasn't able to send him the art I was fond of nor could I take the video call we scheduled until an hour after agreed. I was still messaging him, but only in the evenings when things died down on my side.

He then sent me a long message saying he wasn't sure about ""this"" if I was someone who didn't carry through when I said I'd do something (he was referring to me not sending him the names of the art and landmarks I was fond of and the fact that the video call was delayed (potentially due to be postponed) because I was dealing with a request from my family to tend to my terminally ill cousin). I had to eventually explain why I wanted to postpone the call, which for me was uncomfortable. I hate talking about my cousin who I know I'm going to lose, let alone tell this all to someone who is a stranger to me. He ended with, I'm not trying to make you think you are a bad person. The arrangement for dinner still stands. 

To clarify, we have been speaking for a total of 6 days having matched.

I feel really overwhelmed. Its been lovely matching with someone who sends plenty of messages (he's demonstrated he is keen unlike what happened with my prior boyfriends), but I also think, we don't owe each other anything yet? Why are you already calling me out on being flaky before you even know anything about me and my life? Normally when I match with someone, when we eventually agree to see each other, we sort of leave it at that, a few messages here or there exchanged, until the day we meet and see if we get on or not.

Its triggered thoughts that perhaps I'm not suited to dating if this is how things start? Maybe I'm not loveable? How are other people simply getting on and dating and picking themselves up and finding new people to date? Am I in the wrong for not engaging in these video calls constantly or by taking too long to send him things like the art that I enjoy?

For now we have plans to have dinner soon, and I made an effort to send him messages early this morning. But truthfully I feel a bit thrown off. Would really appreciate some perspective on this. 

Thank you for taking time to read all this.","First of all I'd say don't date anyone you're meh about looks wise. I've tried dating guys I don't find very attractive..it's never worked out. They don't have to be knockouts but what's the point if you're not dying to kiss them. 

Second I would say you have been flakey. If I liked a guy and was excited for our first date and he cancelled scheduled calls or forgot something he said he would do.. I would be disappointed. 

I get you are strangers and you owe him nothing.. but if you are putting yourself out there and trying to date...it doesn't look good on your end. People want effort and consistency. 

If you can't provide that then maybe you shouldn't be dating whilst going through such turbulent times. 

If you're Purley looking to hook up then that's different, the expectations are lower. But if you are out there in a possible relationship capacity.. then yeah people have expectations. 

He was rude about it though and I personally don't think he's worth pursuing."
datingoverthirty,11fxr9w,1677746723.0,This guy im dating is a bit full on and quite needy or is it im the problem?,"I (35f) started dating this great guy (30m) 3 months ago. Throughout the dating he's been great, he is overseas right now for 3 weeks for a holiday that i knew from the first date, he is very transparent towards me, I actually LOVE the time apart as I get to do my travel nursing without feelung guilty, now he is coming back home in 2 days and I will come bavk home in 3 days.

Anyway, this guy is very kind, he checks up on me everyday and calls me everyday, everytime I call him he will pick it up regardless if he is back in his hotel room or with his friends, he will send pictures of the things he is up to several times a day and updates me, all he asked is ill do the same thing, which i do as much as I can.

what I realized tho is, he can be full on.. he worries about me finding someone else and leave him, he worries about my job, he worries about being not good enough and worries about not hearing from me in a day and feels so guilty he had to go in a holiday which he booked way before he met me. 

I worked really hard and I like my lifestyle, I make good money doing this and he suggested maybe I can just focus on my other job in my city (ive got 3 jobs altogether, quite workaholic) on the other hand he owns 2 restaurants and he only works long hours 3 to 4x a week, whenever we are both home in our city he wants to spend all of his waking mornings with me, he would call me for hours at night and texts me few times in morning. Dont get me wrong. it is very nice but I feel like I wanted space, he worries I would leave him.

Example was 2 nights ago, he was out with his friends and i tried to call him, he didnt picked up, i assumed he was out and having dinner (time difference) i texted him afterwards saying enjoy the night. i proceeded to sleep. I tirned off my wifi (i do this sometimes when i dont want to be bothered) and slept for 9hrs, I was so tired at work! When I woke up, i made myself coffee, do my morning routine without checking my phone. When I checked my phone I saw multiple missed calls from him and texts. He even got his friend back home to check up on me, he was worried something happened to me. Hmmmm, i dont know what to feel. I re assured him and he told me he didnt slept the whole night trying to get a hold of me. He was so worried that I finally video called him, he was so frustrated but relieved,  he told me he almost smash his phone out of frustration, as he is so far from me, if i decided to leave him, he cant fo anything.  I re assured him im not going anywhere. He was fine afterwards.

He told me, why does he feel like I would leave him anytime? That im not serious about him, that I am not that excited about him. I am. But idk why he feels like this. He said, he is scared of how much he likes me that if he let himself completely vulnerable towards me, I will wreck him. He is thinking longterm with me and he doesbt know whats going on in my head most of the time.

He wants to introduce me to all his friends and family when we both get back, he asked me if im ready. i said okay. But idk if im ready to introduce him to my friends. I dont think im in that level yet. but i know i will. How can i explain this to him without him overthinking anything?

Thank you","If you're feeling relieved that he's gone because you can do your job without guilt, please really listen to that. This sounds way too intense to fix with a conversation or any reasonable modification of your behavior, I think."

Well, I've gone and done it. I followed the consensus and waited until I was well situated. The job is going well, I have a new place in a new part of town, but I'm still basically lost on The dating front. the weird thing is, I moved into a busy bustling downtown, and still have no idea where to meet people, or how to approach them with romantic intentions once I do. I don't have any trouble making friends mind you, but I've had trouble escalating into relationship territory for my whole life.

Finally I moved on, sort of ‚Äî I was busy and in therapy, started a new job, dated someone else for 3 ish months, then got an email from him asking to see me again. 
I had a lot of questions for him and was very careful about opening my heart to him again, but he came back a very different person, very ready to love. While we were apart, he had reconnected with old friends and family that he had lost contact with during his prior, difficult relationship; I think as he returned to a sense of general stability and well-being, he realized he missed me. Also he went on a lot of dates with different girls and found himself thinking about how much better he and I got along, lol. I‚Äôm really glad we went through what we did because instead of battling my way through a relationship with someone who wasn‚Äôt quite sure about me, which I would‚Äôve done if he hadn‚Äôt broken up with me, I ended up with someone who sought me out, and didn‚Äôt come back to ask for my time until he knew he had something worthy and complete to offer me. 
I‚Äôm sorry for what you‚Äôre going through. Not that you asked, but my advice is to try to make the most of all of your time‚Äî pour the love you feel for that guy back into yourself somehow. I think it‚Äôs perfectly possible that he will come back, and it‚Äôs also sadly possible that you‚Äôve heard the last from him. Just try to keep it pushing for yourself and when it‚Äôs possible, make yourself open to other connections. Also, don‚Äôt reach out to him!! If he‚Äôs ready for you he will hit you up. Sending love"
datingoverthirty,11fkc5f,1677709859.0,Do you openly communicate that you practice dating with intention?,"If you practice dating with intention do you openly communicate that? I'm considering just being more open in general and having the conversation much earlier about what it is I'm looking for and my dating/relationship philosophy. I feel like often times I get this text saying we're not compatible when I have no idea what it is the other person is even looking for since we never had a conversation about it.

To me dating with intention just means that what I'm looking to get out of a date is to learn what their values are, figure out if I like spending time with them, if we have anything in common, how we communicate, and what they are looking for. Basically just gathering information about them as person, how they make me feel, and if there is potential to build a connection over time. I think one important thing though is after a date openly communicating this to the other person, taking some time to reflect on the date, and just asking how they thought our date went. Very often I dont actually reflect on a date and just ask the other person out again. 

Does this seem crazy/unreasonable? I realize it requires a certain maturity, being vulnerable, honest, and open to feedback but it seems like it could lead to better results?",If it‚Äôs crazy then‚Ä¶ I guess I‚Äôm a nut. I am very open from the very beginning that I am dating with the end goal of marriage and that I do not want children. I am also very direct about what type of qualities I am looking for in a person and expectations of a partner. I clearly communicate deal breakers. I don‚Äôt do this like it‚Äôs an interrogation or interview but I don‚Äôt shy away from them. I own all parts of it confidently. It saves me from wasting time with people who are very obviously not a good fit for me. It has lead to fewer dates but with higher quality people.
datingoverthirty,11ff29h,1677699939.0,How do you deal with loneliness?,"Hello fellow over 30 daters üòä

TL;DR - I'm looking for suggestions on how to cope with romantic loneliness that don't involve online dating platforms. 

I'm curious to know how you deal with loneliness? I have REALLY been struggling with it. It's not just the kind of loneliness where you can hang out with some friends and move on with your life - it's that loneliness that craves to be desired; the loneliness that picks up your phone excited to see a text but nothing is there; the loneliness where you're laying in bed at night wanting to feel someone's warm touch on your skin and hear them talking to you about literally anything. 

I'm cultivating a great relationship with myself through a lot of self care, affirmations, and pursuit of my goals, all of which have greatly benefited from therapy. I feel great about myself and every time I reach for that affirmation, there's loneliness sitting there waiting to invalidate that feeling with a dismissive, ""Oh yeah? Then how are you still single, especially considering the fruitless effort you've already put into dating? ""

It's been a real struggle to not let that demotivate me and, at times it still does successfully. I'm hoping to find some ways to cast a new light on that feeling as new perspectives seem to be really powerful tools for me. As an example: my therapist helped me realize my procrastination habits are rooted in survival instincts to avoid pain and I make a judgement that what I'm going to do will be painful before I even start so - she helped me reframe it with a mantra of, ""I love this pain"". I use it when I'm feeling that pain of getting something started which forces me to analyze why the hell I would believe something like that, which in turn helps me recognize the value of pushing through. So, my internal (or sometimes external) monologue evolves into, ""I love this pain because through it, I gain..."". 

I'm making a lot of progress in that department but, this feeling of romantic loneliness is so persistent, pervasive and perturbing - it can really disrupt me in the moment.","This is something I definitely still struggle with at times but have sound some solace in accepting that I might end up alone. I know that sounds counter intuitive but for some reason accepting that finding a partner or being alone are both equally possible and that I will be ok either way has soothed some of my lonely feelings. Its like once I stopped fighting against being alone it somehow relieved some of the pain of being alone. I feel like I'm talking in circles but it somehow has worked in my own head/heart. I also fully embrace those moments of deep, painful loneliness. Allowing myself to be sad and upset when the feelings do come up has allowed them to pass much quicker."

He responded but ignored the question about the date so I'll take that as my answer. 

Thanks for the feedback y'all. 

Edit 1: consensus is just to ask him out directly and see what he says, which ill do!


-----
Original: I 33f have been chatting with someone 28m for a month and we've gone on two dates. Had to travel for business last week so our communication has taken a hit. we were texting a couple times a day but now he's taking days to respond. Before that it was really good banter and we both asked questions trying to get to know each other.

I hate feeling like I'm always initiating/chasing but wouldn't mind putting myself out there to figure out if he's still interested or if I need to move on. Trying to be more intentional about communicating my needs/desires so I'm not spiraling but also don't want to come off crazy. (Where my anxious attachment overthinking people at?!)

Can y'all help me draft a message that clearly communicates that I have enjoyed getting to know them and want to continue but they need to put up or shut up? See draft below: (context with flowers, he bought me potted tulips before I left and I asked him to look after them while I was on my trip because I am a notorious plant killer lol)

--
Draft: Hey checking for signs of life with my flowers üòπ So not sure if I'm reading too much into it but have noticed you haven't been communicating as much.    Are you busy or are you not really interested anymore? I think you're dope and would like to still see you/get to know you but the infrequency activates my anxiety üòµ‚Äçüí´ Would love to know where your head is at.","What I‚Äôd recommend, as a person with anxiety and anxious attachment issues, is not to bring your anxiety up as the basis of any communication issues between the two of you until you‚Äôre on the brink of commitment. Up until then, it simply is not his responsibility what activates your anxiety. 

I wouldn‚Äôt even bring it up to him as information. I used to send texts like yours, convincing myself that I was being straightforward and honest, and it pushed every single person away. It took me a long time to learn what I was doing ‚Äî asking strangers to validate me against my feelings of insecurity around ‚Äúthe not knowing‚Äù. 

But the not knowing is just a part of early dating that we all deal with, those with anxiety and those without. It‚Äôs just harder for those of us with anxiety to ride it out, but it doesn‚Äôt give us a free pass to offload our sense of security to another person to manage. 

Additionally, two dates is far too early to confront someone about their change of pace in communication. Just check in with a friendly text just to say hi, let him know you‚Äôd love to get together when he‚Äôs back in town, then mirror his behavior after that."

I have zero debt, have never been married, don't have any children, exercise regularly and, in general, have my act together. I can afford to live by myself but am thinking about getting a 2 bed / 2 bath place and having a friend move in with me. In general I'm very cautious about getting a roommate but this friend is one of only three I could actually live it. I'm not anticipating any issues. My plan is get a place that I can afford by myself and then use his rent money towards investments, car payment etc. I recently moved to this city and am still trying to integrate so it will be nice to have a familiar face around. Also, we're both clean people and the place will not resemble a college bachelor pad.

However, I'm now starting to psyche myself out that having a roommate will be a huge red flag when it comes to dating. I've asked a few of my girl friends for their opinion and a majority of them say it would make them think twice before dating me.

datingoverthirty,11emkco,1677624539.0,I get over breakups very quickly; does that mean I didn't love the person?,"That's what my ex said at least, when I moved on a few weeks after our breakup.

Depending on the health of the relationship and the connection with the person, I usually get over breakups anywhere from 1 week to 1 month after it's over. I don't think it's ever taken me longer than that to get over someone. In terms of how I deal with the breakup, it's quite a lot of self-isolation, a bit of sadness, some crying spells here and there, and a bit too much drinking and eating junk food. But I think because I know these bad feelings are temporary, I kind of quickly adjust to the idea of moving on.

My ex seemed to think that because I move on so quickly after breakups, I've probably never actually loved anyone because no one who is truly in love gets over the end of a relationship that quickly. He also said quite a few things about how I never really get worked up over things in relationships (I'm more of a calm talker), I don't really get jealous or possessive, if he expressed unhappiness about anything, I would take it way too well and try to fix it. But if it was an unfixable thing, I would be way too calm while trying to talk to him about it.

All in all, my emotional state in relationships and especially after the breakup made him feel like I never cared to begin with. Now, I know that's not true - I really did care so much about him, I wanted to marry him, I did (in my belief) *everything* I could to make him feel secure in the relationship, told my family about him, invited him to meet friends, went on a trip with him to his home country, planned many things around *his* life, put a lot of mutually-agreed future ""us"" plans into action, was nonstop super giddy and verbally/physically *extremely* complimentary and affectionate, but alas. It ended. I really loved him like I've never loved anyone before.

But...maybe that wasn't love after all? Idk. I got over him in a month. I can't help but believe what he said about me, especially as I'm starting to get to know a new guy right now and am extra conscious about what my ex said about me.",You're lucky. lol.
datingoverthirty,11ek65z,1677618922.0,Anxiety around multi-dating and intentions from matches,"I (30F) recently met someone very wonderful (31M), and usually when I get to this point of genuinely being interested in someone, swiping and matching on apps goes on the back burner and I focus on the person in front of me to see things out. At first I‚Äôll go on first dates with 2-3 people and then if all works well, one person ends up standing out. However, once I catch myself in that space, I find myself getting extremely anxious how the other person is moving. Much like another post on this sub recently put it, I have a lot of hangups around being ‚Äúsecond fiddle‚Äù as I‚Äôve experienced a lot of that in the past. No matter how much I‚Äôve pushed myself to pursue multi-dating, it‚Äôs just never felt authentic to how I process my emotions. That being said, I don‚Äôt believe in being controlling or pushing people to move in the same direction as me‚ÄîI get everyone‚Äôs really different, and some people don‚Äôt focus on one person after only a couple of dates. That said, it doesn‚Äôt really alleviate the anxiety. The 31M I mentioned seems pretty into me, pretty focused and present, but I don‚Äôt like to assume where someone‚Äôs at until they confirm/affirm focusing on me as fact. 

I‚Äôm curious if anyone else has had a success story in this arena‚Äîdid dating one person off an app pan out smoothly for you? How did you navigate those first couple of months of anxiety?

Give specific examples of how to word this!

It's like no one can win. If you put basic stuff like you enjoy yoga, museums or want someone genuine, you are told ""everyone wants that, show your values""!

Even with the dating profiles of the men I come across, I'm not seeing a ""personality"" either. If they are filled out at all, it's either very basic (the way to win me over is chips and queso; my simple pleasures are going for walks, traveling, having a relaxing night in).

Last week before I switched my Bumble profile to date mode, I went on the BFF mode to see how other women worded their profiles.

My eyes glazed over anything that just listed things (in a bulleted format). But for all profiles where the bio had sentences, even with listing basic interests that everyone has, I could still get a vibe on the type of friend they would be (ex. bonding over activities, bonding over brunch/drinking, mom friends, etc.).

This is just so discouraging.","I think if you try to cover EVERYTHING in a dating profile it will always be bland/boring. You're just giving people a taste.

It's specific, it gives people prompts on which to talk to you, it conveys the same information without a generic laundry list that doesn't stand out. 

I personally always prefer a bit of a jokey profile, especially if the metrics are filled out, like on hinge the kids/politics/drugs etc. That's all covered, I just want to know I don't need to pull teeth to have a conversation. And it's during conversation that you learn about a person."

datingoverthirty,11dj9m5,1677523306.0,Dating radius UK cities,"Hi, all I (38F) saw this was posted previously but with only a few responses and mostly from those driving and USA based.

I'm in a major city in the UK and currently my mile radius on Hinge / OLD is set to 8 miles. This is because I use public transport and even getting from north to south of the city can take 1hr - 1.5 hours (and that distance is only 8-9 miles!) by public transport so I've kept the radius smaller..

I'm not adverse moving to somewhere an hour or two outside of the city /to the coast if I was building a future with someone so part of me wonders if I should extend the radius more, though I appreciate meeting after work for a date or on a weekend morning could prove difficult in the early stages .

I posted in the daily threads a month ago about changing my Hinge location to a nearby smaller city/town i was about to visit (I love that place) and I was getting such good matches, that had thought out answers and responses. It was insane!  (In my city I get a quite a few likes a day but only maybe 1-2 matches I'd like to talk to per week or two)

For context that smaller city/town would be 2.5 hour journey door to door (taxi and train) which isn't realistic probably for early dating.

I'm dating with intent to meet a partner /build a life and have/adopt a kid so I am serious and I'm wondering if my lower miles remit is hampering things I would love to hear other peoples  perspectives?

As I don't drive in the city (it's very high cost of living anyway) and no need to drive given public transport. 

I'm wondering if I'm lowering my chances by having a smallish radius is there anyone in UK cities that have experience with this where they mostly but I am public transport, old Ubers/taxis to get to dates?

Thanks in advance DOT!","I used to live in London and had a small radius for my online dating.  I lived in West London (Ealing) and dated someone for a bit that lived in East London but it was so difficult to hang out due to it taking over an hour to see each other on public transport.

It doesn‚Äôt make sense to match with someone that you would rarely ever see (unless you‚Äôre comfortable with that scenario).

IMO meeting someone through a dating app and meeting someone in real life are two different scenarios and you can't expect one to replicate the other.

If you meet someone as a friend, it makes sense that feelings can develop over time.

In online dating (or date with a new person through some similar context) it's going to come across as wishy-washy and uncommital to ask someone to be friends first (or to essentially treat them as a friend rather than a potential partner) for a few months before exploring romance.

Spark has so many different definitions but I think there needs to be a little zest between you to keep the person engaged enough to move through all the barriers to forming a longterm relationship. Because it's otherwise a lot of work and emotional stress to go through just to end up with someone you feel like ""meh, not bad, hits the checkmarks I guess"" for. I think it's very normal to know whether that's there or not by date 3."

datingoverthirty,11cokhk,1677435795.0,Help needed with dealing with jealousy,"Hey fam, I‚Äôve been dating a guy for ~4 months and it‚Äôs honestly been amazing - he treats me super well, isn‚Äôt afraid to talk about long term plans, and has shown that he is prioritising me. At this point we spend every weekend together. We‚Äôve not had any arguments and the only thing that bothers me is my jealousy issue.

1) His best friends are female. They‚Äôve known each other a long time (>10 years) and never dated / had anything sexual going on. They text on a daily basis, and he travels alone with them (when he was single). But when he‚Äôs with me, he‚Äôs really good about not using his phone and prioritising being present with me, he never prioritises plans with them over me, etc. So logically I know that there‚Äôs no reason for me to be jealous - but I suppose I‚Äôm jealous of the fact that I‚Äôm not as close to him as his best friends (yet) and that they have so much shared memories and know him so well that it‚Äôll be a long time till I catch up.

2) His last relationship was pretty recent and lasted a long time (~5 years). They had milestones and memories that I‚Äôve never shared with any exes (eg. Living together), and somehow I‚Äôm feeling retroactive jealousy about that too.

I know these are MY issues and I‚Äôve not brought it up to him yet, because I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair for him to deal with it, but I‚Äôve just been trying to get over it internally and still feel it creeping up on me. Does anyone have experience with this and can help me reframe this so I can stop harping on it?

Thank you!",Is it possible to try and build some sort of your own relationships with these girl friends? I‚Äôm not sure I can articulate exactly what it is but something about knowing my partners friends better makes me feel more comfortable about his relationship with him.
datingoverthirty,11cha35,1677418425.0,I (31 M) am afraid if being in a relationship and also of ending up alone. Not sure what to do.,"I'll try to keep this as short as possible for brevity.

I'm a 31 year old male who has been in four relationships till date, longest of them being 5 years. 

In each of these relationships there was always a pattern. The girl would be attracted to me because of my fun-loving nature and happy disposition towards life in general. But in each of them, they always ended up trying to control me. Change my behaviours, even try to stop me from doing the things I like. I wouldn't really notice this happening until it's too late and at some point my friends point out how I'm not at all the same person.

Some of them would withold sex and use it as a reward system for doing what they wanted me to do. 

Needless to say, I have a very distorted view of relationships where I am constantly worried that the next girl will also do the same. At the same time, I want someone to share my life with. But everytime I go out or meet women, I shut off completely, and this can range from not showing interest in them to avoiding them entirely.

I am not sure what to do. I'm very comfortable being alone and doing things alone but I've always been the type that wants to have someone to dote on and be a partner in crime, so to speak.

The question I want to ask is are all relationships built on power and control? Is it just something I have to expect and resist if I have to keep my integrity?

Any other advice is also welcome. Thank you.","Relationships aren't built on power and control, they're built on compromise. 

It's easy for us to say that no one should ever try to change a partner. But realistically, I think it's more mature to ask what those changes are? Because you don't say. Influencing someone who drinks too much to drink less, for example, is not a black and white ""bad thing"". Asking your partner to join you in co-ed volleyball instead of staying in to game every night is also not a black and white ""bad thing"". 

For me, a perfect relationship includes growing together and growing is change. 

Withholding sex as a form of manipulation is wrong. But, again, let's be mature and recognize nuance. It's reasonable to not want to have sex with a partner if you want them to shower everyday and they consider that an unnecessary change. It is also reasonable to genuinely not feel like having sex with someone you're upset with, not communicating well with, or just annoyed that they are leaving dirty dishes in the sink overnight. No one is entitled to sex from someone else. But if someone's requirement for sex is outrageously unreasonable (you wore the blue shirt to the party not the green one), or a change you're unwilling to make (the dishes can wait until the morning), you can and probably should end the relationship. 

It is important that you learn to be comfortable alone. If you don't want children, or don't mind having them later in life, taking a break to figure that out seems like a good idea.

With the way you talk about control and integrity, you also may want to consider if maybe your ideal woman might be very submissive, while in the past you've perhaps gone for the opposite."
datingoverthirty,11chmmg,1677419437.0,Can you make it better to them once you ended things in an unclear way?,"From October to ~December, I was in a situationship (I needed a slow pace after a tough breakup and communicated it) with someone who fell hard for me. He always expresses himself in a very soft, poetic and imaged way, is very sensitive, and we had a rich artistic exchange - I adapted to his language, feeling like being very direct was brutal when talking with him. 

An intimate incident turned me off pretty abruptly and, although we could discuss it openly, I couldn't get over it and cancelled our NYE plans (to the point I refunded his plane tickets). We had a chat a few weeks later where told him I needed to keep being on my own but that we could check in a few weeks later, when I'd be back in town. In my mind, this meant I didn't intend to feed the relationship. I got sick, a few weeks turned into more than a month, and he kept sending me a lot of art and supportive messages, that I mostly ignored. 

He eventually left me a long vocal note to say he was in emotional distress/wanted more/wanted to know what was up with me (in a much more elaborate wording) to which I answered that I still felt turned off and didn't think it would change and was struggling with a few things of my own. His next note was all about how much he wanted to care for me/help and completely flew over the part I said my feelings hadn't reverted. So I articulated very clearly ""I do not want a romantic relationship with you anymore"" along with kind words and alologies for the confusion. 

He has not said anything since and I suspect he is having a horrible time. I don't know how to make it better, if I should show support, take more responsibility for the poor communication, or just let it be. I wish I hadn't been so overwhelmed with my own things and would have been clearer and faster at answering his various messages but what can I do about it now?

***Edit: The incident would require me to loop you in a lot of intimate details. I respect reddit curiosity and will tell you in PM if you must know :) In one sentence: He kept doing a thing while perceiving I wasn't into it. This, and the fact I didn't stop it happened in a context, we discussed it extensively after, he apologized profusely. I believe it was an honest mistake but it grossed me out. 
I tried to snap out of the aversion but couldn't","You did make things better. You miscommunicated, you belatedly recognized it and cleared things up, he dropped off. 

This is his genuine reaction to the breakup (he probably is having a hard time).

It's normal to have sporadic or friendly communication after a breakup and it's normal to go no-contact. You mistakenly thought he was the first type, but really he just didn't understand that it was a firm break up. 

Take the lesson and leave the guy. 

P.s.-> we are all dying to know what the 'intimate incident' that turned you off so abruptly was. Share if you feel comfortable."

Single for 2+ years but have been going on dates sporadically. The last person (31M) that I had several dates with seemed very uncomfortable with my sobriety. I never discourage people from drinking appropriately in my presence. He would have several beers over several hours, the whole time saying, ""Are you sure this is okay? I feel really bad doing this"" ... which is courteous, but this happened every time he drank around me. 

I'm comfortable with my sobriety but am wondering if it could make potential partners look me over if they enjoy drinking socially?","I dated someone like you when I was drinking more heavily. Having sex with someone sober was odd for me even. But their soberness just made me aware of how much I was drinking.

datingoverthirty,11bhtgp,1677320702.0,How do you wait to have sex?,"Hey all :)

I (F30) have been talking with this guy from OLD and we will have our first date next weekend.
We seem to have a lot in common and I am very looking forward to meet him and find out if there is the same vibe also in person.

Now, I usually have sex between date 1-3. Unfortunately I have been going through a little medical issue, and it's better to not have sex until it's completely healed. Hopefully this should not take more than 1 or 2 months, if I am lucky enough to not have relapses. I would like to take the chance to see if it's true that not having sex right away make any kind of difference (in my opinion it shouldn't but for my experience was very hard to move on a more serious level from that).

How do you manage it? Do you disclose right away that you prefer to wait? And if so, how do you say it in a way that the other person would understand and accept? Or you just avoid going to each other places? And how long are you usually willing to wait?

Sorry if it's a silly question, it's a new territory for me üòÖ

Have a nice weekend :)

EDIT: It's not an STD","I think you should just tell them what you told us (about the medical issue, I mean). Not right away, but if/when it's suggested that you go to each other's place.

I think most guys who are looking for a long term relationship would be understanding of that. If not, they probably wouldn't be a great partner anyway."

datingoverthirty,11b2v4h,1677274671.0,"The one date red flag ""rules""","I'm (35F) having a bit of a hard time trying to realistically determine whats best for me. I was raised by two parents who had that type of love that is so rare it seems unreal. they met and were married 3 months later until the day my dad passed away. my mother will never remarry and has no interest in dating. that was her partner and shes happy to have been loved and love so deeply. This was even the case with my grandparents, so much so that they died hours apart just like some Notebook shit. It was truly beautiful (although sad too).

It's fucked me up having those being the examples in my life.  I have had to work through it in therapy that this is not how most dating experiences go. Even more so because that's exactly how my ex and I were when we met. We moved in together 5 days after meeting and were together for 8 good years.  So my brain has been wired to think that this is how dating should be. but most people today if they want something super serious after one date its a red flag. Which i understand can lead to extremely manipulative behaviors and end up being a toxic relationship.  I do not disagree with that at all either.

Are you a ""if you know you know so go with the flow"" type person when it comes to dating or are you a ""there's several standards and boundaries we have to determine before dating"" type person? It could be generational too idk.

EDIT: thank you all for sharing. i wish i had more time to continue reading your replies and responding but need to log off for the night. a lot of really beautiful stories in here and good advice to feel the feels while giving it time to grow. i will definitely be taking some advice into the dating journey i'm on now :)","So I‚Äôm the one from a fucked up family in my relationship, and I had to pass him through months of filters and build an indisputable burden proof about him for a long time before I trusted him ‚Ä¶. Mainly because I don‚Äôt trust myself to see red flags.

However - he is like you. Two wonderful parents, has had two serious relationships that start fast, get serious, last for years. At the end of our first date he told me his plans for the rest of the summer so I knew how often we would see eachother. We hadn‚Äôt even kissed yet! I thought it was funny and I was flattered that he liked me so much.

I mean I thought he was adorable, but I was slower to move into serious thoughts than he was. I kept dating for a few weeks, I‚Äôm pretty sure I was the only person he saw from the second we met. When I asked to be exclusive he was like ‚ÄúI thought it was implied.‚Äù When we first brought up labels, we were both clearly exclusive and happy, but I was the one who was like - let‚Äôs not rush it. And he was like, ok cool by me.

He‚Äôs got incredible relationship skills. He‚Äôs so fucking stable - it blows my mind. I love how he was serious from the beginning, and he was clear about it, and not ashamed - yet he never pressured me. He let me come around to it in my own time.

So I think if you know someone is a good fit, you can think long term all you want! But just give them time and move slowly. Don‚Äôt jump into relationship mode - don‚Äôt launch into good morning beautifuls and long weekends together. Let it grow naturally! Purposefully focus on your own life, keep yourself busy, and promise yourself focus down on your life outside of the new person for the first few months. This will give it time and space to grow!"

datingoverthirty,11a9k55,1677188370.0,Definition of Being Independent as a Girl,"Late 20s girl interested in seeing how men 30+ define ""independent."" I've come across a few profiles now of men in their mid to late 30s seeking for an independent girl. I'm just curious what they mean by that as I feel like being independent can really vary.

A bit of a background, I'm an asian girl in her late 20s who still lives at home. The reason I live at home is probably because asian culture wise, girls don't move out until they get married. I don't plan to live at home forever, especially if I don't meet the one. But it's not exactly set when I'll be moving out. I initially had hoped like many cousins, I'd move out when I get married and meet the one lol (and obviously that hasn't happened yet). I also was dating a fellow between my mid 20s and he was in medical school, and didn't know where he'd end up so didn't want to settle down until I knew. But we broke up last year. After a break, I felt ready to start dating again and realized the expectations vary amongst ages.

Most men around my age and early 30s don't seem to mind it. But I found mid-30s to later 30s men seem to tell me that they want someone independent without giving me a solid definition.

To be fair, I don't see myself as dependent. Yes, I live at home. But I contribute a lot financially to everything at home. My parents aren't fluent in English, so I handle a lot for my parents and family. I have a job which I think is pretty stable and a retirement pension. I've been saving so when I meet the one we can purchase a home together. I have my own plans and activities, yet I value spending quality time with my family. But living at home, my cooking skills and other skills are obviously much slower than those who own their own place. But I don't see it as an issue. I trust when I move out, I'd be able to cook and learn. But living at home, my mom would do majority of the cooking. With that said, would this be a major turnoff for men 30+?

Just curious! Regardless, I don't feel the need to move out simply to meet the need of someone who wants someone independent, but I am curious how guys see this on apps. Thanks :)

EDIT:

Thanks so much everyone for the feedback! :) Really appreciate it! Dating in my late 20s is very different than dating in my early to mid-20s lol. But the conclusion I've come to is the term independent can highly vary amongst people. However, the general definition seems to be able to take care of yourself financially, have your own friend group and hobbies, and etc. The level of independence seems to vary slightly depending on the individual as to how independent they want their partner to be, but a broad view is just having your own interest, being able to take care of yourself, and having financial independence.","Independent?

I‚Äôm 36 and I would define that as‚Ä¶ have a job, have your own place, have your own transportation. Your own circle of friends, maybe some hobbies. Self-actualized and emotionally stable."
datingoverthirty,119z7lh,1677162981.0,Should I increase age range for finding someone if having family is my goal?," I am 40 and do want to settle down and have a family.  I do come from asian background and the past generation always emphasize on younger women age for pregnancies etc. and I understand men have their biological issues too. I am currently setting my max age at 36, assuming if things work out well could be married with kids by 38 (have few coworkers who did that).

I did sign up for It's just lunch with their 3 months unlimited deal. I am told by my matchmaker that I am letting go of ""great catches"" who are \~40 and age is a number - is she right that i might be excluding some opportunities because i am fixated on the age? For example, she is planning to introduce me a 38 , 39 and 36 year old and she said the 38 and 39 are successful and beautiful (i know marketing speak).

Would I be missing out on potential sparks by just filter them by age or it should matter and there should be a ""cutoff"" at some point?

And no, if I am looking for someone to have a kid with 0 chemistry I wouldve done so already.","Focus less on age and planning for pregnancy and focus more on connection and values. You can have difficulty with pregnancies at any age. I know people who miscarried and have severe complications at 22 and at 45. I know people who have had easy pregnancies at 22 and at 45.

That said, I have finally met someone that I find myself developing feelings for. I have noticed for myself in the past that when I develop feelings for someone I do tend to get a little anxious about my attachment. I am overall very secure & confident in myself but in these early days I find myself feeling worked up about whether or not I'm second-choice/second-fiddle to someone else.

I operate under the assumption that everyone is seeing multiple people (I mean, I am too), so why do I get so worked up about the idea of others dating others at the same time? I feel like a hypocrite.

I don't have issues casually dating or keeping emotions out of something that I don't see a long-term future in, but I find myself already unrealistically projecting onto this woman I'm into things like imagined futures, whether or not her messaging/texting is indicative that she's seeing someone else, or whether she's still into me, etc. And we've only been on 3 dates.

TL;DR: Normally very secure, level-headed, can casually date multiple people at a time and enjoy myself, but as soon as I get attached, my emotional brain takes over.

Any advice (particularly from men) on combating this? I am still seeing other people but I am definitely investing most of my time (and at this point, thoughts) in this one woman.

So for me this feeling of insecurity/anxiety is very new and I believe it's mostly wrapped up in the fact that like someone else mentioned, I fear rejection from this person in particular. I've been rejected/turned down, ghosted, cancelled on, etc. tons in the past; it doesn't phase me; I feel like this one would. So here I am. Anyways, thanks again for everyone who took the time to comment. I must say that a few of the comments strike me as a bit off base, accusing me of having an unhealthy or toxic personality simply because I'm admitting I feel anxious and insecure and I'm looking for helping managing those feelings. That seems odd and lacking in understanding to me.","As a guy who tended to whittle down the number of women I dated as I got to know someone that felt ‚Äúspecial‚Äù, I think my advice in your scenario is to have an honest conversation with the woman you like.  

Rather than worrying about her dating other people, if you know that you are naturally gravitating towards her more than others then I would personally discuss that with her.  By having that discussion, you eliminate any uncertainty and you also give her an opportunity to express whether she is also gravitating towards you more than others."
datingoverthirty,119rk02,1677136812.0,Should I tell her he cheated?,"I dated a guy for a year. He broke up with me with no reason why. And immediately started dating someone else. This was last April. 

5 months later he was back in my dms making sexy talk. I had no idea he was still dating this other person. When I found out I was clearly upset and called him out and set boundaries. 

5 weeks goes by (I assume he's not with her. Wrong.) He was giving me more attention than he ever had, opening up and being more vulnerable than ever and told me the reason he broke up with me (he didn't feel like he had enough to give). I of course pour my heart out and tell him what he was giving was enough etc etc. After two months of every day, all day the conversation that re-escaltes to non-platonic over time,  I find out he's still with her. So I call it quits. 

He messages me 2 weeks later that he broke up with her. I made the mistake of getting involved again. Because he's a real charmer and it seems like he wants to be with me. And, we actually met up 4 times between Dec and Jan. Out of nowhere, he cuts it off (with no reason just like the first time) a few days ago.

I am 1000% done. Never again. But, I also know he's stringing the gal he cheated on with me along and/or she is definitely still pining after him.  

Does she deserve to know about his unfaithfulness? Do I tell her the truth so she can avoid the eventual heartache he'll lead her to again? Or no?",You have a problem of continuing to entertain him. Don't talk to him anymore.

I‚Äôve been getting back on the dating game, really connected with a guy, just to clarify, it was only like a 25 days thing (counting when we started talking and meet) 

We had our ups and downs , especially when he decided to not take things further with me, after being intimate and having a wonderful weekend together. 

I feel myself stuck on thinking about him. Fairly frequently. (To the point that I have thought about him/us during sex with someone else‚Ä¶)

datingoverthirty,119ja5g,1677112720.0,Choosing a better partner/knowing what‚Äôs appropriate,"I got out of a 3-year relationship last summer. I stupidly didn‚Äôt stick to no contact, am now devastated because my ex ghosted me/moved on & is dating someone new; we exchanged ‚ÄúI love you‚Äùs as recently as November‚Ä¶blah blah blah drama & heartbreak. I want to use this time to figure out who I am again and avoid dating for a while so I don‚Äôt get sucked into codependent relationships. 

One thing I‚Äôve been reflecting on is my pursuit of emotionally unavailable men. My ex was unfailingly polite but I later realized he wasn‚Äôt necessarily *kind* as he told me what he thought I wanted to hear to avoid conflict. He‚Äôd quietly stew and blow up occasionally but for the most part it was hard to uncover his true feelings on things. He kept to himself and would go quiet when I‚Äôd try to go deeper. I got it into my head that I was being invasive, that it was none of my business, that I was being controlling, I basically blamed myself for these things instead of examining how closed his communication style was. I need someone who trusts me enough to open up/be vulnerable with me, because I prefer to have a partner I can share everything with & who will tell me when I‚Äôm doing something that they don‚Äôt like.

However I‚Äôm still having trouble knowing what appropriate boundaries look like. I have a really invasive and narcissistic mother and I think overcorrected by staying with emotionally unavailable men for fear of becoming like her. Where is the line between open communication and demanding too much information from your partner?

edit: I see a therapist already and she supports my commitment to being single for the time being. Thought it would be interesting to survey the responses here since we are peers.","I didn‚Äôt answer your last question- when we are partnered with someone more emotionally elusive/ avoidant of intimacy, we can end up feeling like normal inquiries are invasive. With someone who doesn‚Äôt feel threatened by vulnerability and intimacy (someone more secure in them self) this will likely not be an issue.

On the flip side, you may want to self-reflect on how you communicate. When I was partnered with someone avoidant, my communication skills suffered and I devolved into using passive aggressive and manipulative comments to try to get ANY response from them. I‚Äôve been practicing using direct communication, expressing my feelings plainly, and asking for my needs directly. To an emotionally healthy person, these won‚Äôt lead to squirrelly behavior."

I recently had a meet-cute and planned a date. While I want to see this guy again I don't want this trust I've just gained back to be lost.

And by that I mean, if he just wants a hook up,  or you know,  is another narcissistic manipulator just love bombing, or is just no good...

Edit: we've met and hung out in a bigger circle twice, I want to see this person again but there's been a couple of things said that make me concerned, but I don't know the full story so I feel bad for judging too quickly BUT self protect mode is on high alert. 

Also, thanks! The input has genuinely helped :)","Neither my partner nor I were excited for our first date & both almost bailed. He because it was a Thursday after work and he was in the middle of a big project and stressed and me because I was over dating and needed a break from men. The date lasted 4+ hours,  we went to 2 bars, and took a long walk, during which he asked permission to kiss me. We close on our house tomorrow & we've already picked out a venue for our future wedding... You can see the location of our first kiss from the venue ü•∞

Eta: I guess I'm saying no, you don't always have to be excited. But you do have to put yourself out there, even if you're not the most excited beforehand. If it goes badly, trust your gut, get out of there and congratulate yourself on being brave enough to go."

It's going to be EXTREMELY easy to tell from a profile you match with whether or not she is ambitious, successful, and educated, and then you'll be able to tell on the first date whether or not she is growth-minded, athletic, and has emotional intelligence. Writing these things on your profile is a turnoff and comes across as a list of demands rather than a good way for unfit women to screen themselves out (which I assume was your intention).

If you were going on a million dates, I could understand why you'd want your dates to weed themselves out, but since that's not the issue you're having, try making the prompts seem a little more fun and generic, and then weed out the incompatible women yourself after a first date."

datingoverthirty,118gtva,1677017857.0,IRL dating,"Can anyone (particularly the male 30+ population here) share if they have had more success dating in real life at this point in time versus doing online dating?  I want to know seriously if it is actually any better and why/how.  I actually see a number of reasons why online dating, as bad as it can be, might be able to get you on more dates than hoping to run into the right person at a bar, in a group, etc.  Let me know because I think about it and I see finding people IRL as a great way to make friends but not necessarily a great way to meet people for relationships.  The issue being lots of people are already on the apps or being in their 30s they aren't out as much.","IRL is much better as a man, simply because of the gender ratios. I've found in the majority of cases, social clubs or events are disproportionately women (volunteering, charity, book clubs, churches, etc.), unless you're joining a gun club or something. Ratios make a massive difference in how prospective partners are perceived - the fact that the same people are also online is irrelevant, because that's not how our prehistoric brains operate (there's an excellent book about this called Date-onomics). I've met everyone I've dated by going to heavily gender skewed settings within my area of interest.

I'd suggest finding groups, classes, clubs, whatever, that involves something you're interested in. Meet and talk to everyone, and over time you'll see who develops interest organically. Don't be put off by initial meetings, I've never dated anyone who displayed interest in me the first handful of times we met, that's just how many women are lol. Assuming you have a better personality than looks :P good luck."
datingoverthirty,118a2j2,1676998981.0,What do you accept as the bottom limit of ‚Äònormal‚Äô interaction?,"OK, so I know there are no hard and fast rules and people‚Äôs interpretation of communication etiquette varies, but I‚Äôm wondering what people consider ‚Äònormal‚Äô regarding communication...

Is it ‚Äònormal‚Äô to not even *read* a WhatsApp message for 2 days?

Context: 3 dates, mutual agreement that no spark but agreement to build friendship and hope more may grow, neither party dating anyone else as rural area and scarcity of matches, message in question was not complex but did involve a slightly time critical direct question.

I know I could give more detail, but it‚Äôs not specifically about that message in particular - I‚Äôm trying to get a feel for what people consider ‚Äònormal‚Äô when using messaging for social communication - in the context of an early friendship/maybe more (vs. an established friendship or defined relationship).

In this digital age, I personally would assume that people in their thirties are at least reading messages on a daily basis, even if they aren‚Äôt responding that quickly.

I‚Äôm not asking what it means that he didn‚Äôt read/reply sooner - just where the consensus boundary is for ‚Äònormal‚Äô. I would see anyone taking longer than 48 hours to read a message as an outlier, even if busy with work etc., and over the boundary into rude territory - but I‚Äôm interested to hear where your set point is?

We agreed we do not have the same expectations for communication and that would be prohibitive to fostering a friendship but I am curious as to how many common that level of interaction is. I know it varies but to me it seems unusual‚Ä¶ trying to work out if I need to adjust my expectations at a population level?! 

Please no comments about overthinking this particular exchange or hoping for a different outcome. I am just looking for a generalised reality check.

**EDIT/UPDATE:** Thanks everyone for the responses, particularly those who answered my actual question. Those who responded with your interpretation as to what it meant‚Ä¶ that wasn‚Äôt what I asked. However, the majority of these replies came to the conclusion that not even opening a message that he knew was there for >48 hrs was a sign of disinterest. 

The plot twist is that this is *exactly* how I interpreted it and he got mad at me, claiming he did really want to foster a friendship. He believes it is entirely normal to not check/read messages for days (note: reading, not replying‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm used to giving leeway for replies). My experience is that most people check daily if not more, even if replies take a while so this being ‚Äònormal‚Äô didn‚Äôt feel right to me. 

As a result, what I was asking for here was people‚Äôs opinions of ‚Äònormal‚Äô to check I wasn‚Äôt way off, as my perspective is easily skewed after a prior relationship involving gaslighting. 

The guy in question and I have already agreed not to try to pursue a friendship or anything more (this was mentioned!).

*I won‚Äôt be replying to any more comments, particularly those talking about message response times as that was NOT the focus on my question. I apologise for not making the point more clearly but beyond highlighting the word ‚ÄòREAD‚Äô (which I did) I‚Äôm not really sure how else I can convey this.

I‚Äôve had to re-emphasise a lot of the points made in the original post in my responses so far; if you‚Äôve any queries or want more information, please skim through other conversations in the comments.*

datingoverthirty,11893xz,1676997635.0,Feels like there‚Äôs something wrong with everyone,"I am 35F, and since I divorced my husband at 30, I have had three boyfriends and been on countless dates. I've had dozens and dozens of first dates, and then several 3 weeks situations. There is always something wrong with every guy/relationship, and I know I'm not too picky - I'm sure this thread would have me break up with them for less.

I divorced my husband because after we got married, he sort of went downhill in life and quit his job and then had me support us for 3 years. He was depressed and had panic attacks constantly. He gained 80 pounds. I loved him and really cared for him, but he was struggling mentally. (He is still struggling and jobless 5 years later). 

One of my boyfriends I broke up with because the sexual chemistry was lacking and we were only having sex once a month and I became so unhappy. I ended the other because we were at different places in life. He was a bit younger, and wasn't ready for the things I wanted.

Recently, I dated a guy for three weeks and had to end it because he was completely un-empathetic to me breaking my arm on a solo trip abroad and said some cruel things instead of just a nice, hope you're ok which is all I needed. Another three week thing ended because I developed feelings and he wanted to keep sleeping with other people. 

I just ended things with my most recent boyfriend of 4 months because of communication issues and him snapping at me over little things. Up until those things started happening I was so excited and felt like he could be the one because of our insane chemistry, sexual and personality, and we were on the same page about relationship goals and lifestyles.

I'm starting to feel like, if it wasn't him, then who could it possibly be? I've dated so many freaking people, and there is always something wrong in every relationship. I'm becoming so discouraged and feel like a failure. Everyone around me has a partner and a family, and it just feels like something is wrong with me that I'm still alone. Am I just picking incorrectly? I tried to ignore the sexual chemistry part in favor of a really great guy on paper, and that obviously didn't work. I now know it's important to be attracted to someone and have that sexual chemistry for a relationship to work, but that's not easy to find in itself. And then all the other things have to align. It feels impossible! Anyone have any words of encouragement or been through something similar and come out the other side?

Edit: btw I honestly don‚Äôt mean there‚Äôs something wrong with every guy and I‚Äôm perfect. I meant there‚Äôs something wrong with every guy FOR ME. Like for whatever reason I‚Äôm having trouble finding a guy that suits me and what I‚Äôm looking for. For example, my ex boyfriend who I didn‚Äôt have sexual chemistry- I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything wrong with him. He‚Äôs so lovely and deserves the world. It just wasn‚Äôt working for me.","Well, honestly speaking there is something wrong with everyone, myself included. The question to be asking is are those things large enough problems to not move forward, or are they something that you can live with?  For the former, break up. For the latter, set yourself a timeline in which to figure out if it's working or not, then make your decision. 

For me, when I met my partner he had a few things I wasn't 100% sure were going to be okay, the biggest being his job situation (he was on sabbatical). But there were enough green flags that I decided to try things out and let him know him not having a job after his sabbatical was up was a dealbreaker. He was fine with that and was back at work well before I needed to worry. 

Obviously the issues are situation dependent. If they are a jerk, liar, hurt people, an abuser, doing illegal or other dangerous things, then this advice doesn't apply and GTFO does instead. But if it's more subjective like you're not sure about that sports team they like, or uncertain how they will get along with your kids, then take it slow and see. People rarely can hide their true colors after a few months."

datingoverthirty,117prlb,1676940231.0,Would you rekindle a previous short term interest?,"I have been on the dating scene again for just over a year. I've always wanted more of a relationship person but have been open to the casual thing while dating.

I (35m) matched with this woman (42f, I‚Äôll call her L) back at the end of June. Met on bumble, chatted for a couple days, had dinner a couple days later. We had an instant connection. Incredibly interesting, kind, smart, funny, beautiful. Weirdly enough, she thought the same of me.

Over the next couple weeks, we saw each other frequently. It was awesome.

I felt myself not being able to match her energy and we stopped seeing each other, but kept in regular contact. 

I took a month off of dating. I was pretty disappointed in myself for not being able to reciprocate what she was putting in and wanted to reevaluate my intentions. 

I started dating slowly again. Met some really great women. I could never really replicate the connection I felt when meeting   L. Not that it was boring meeting these other women. I feel like I can have fun and good conversation with just about anybody. 

Well a couple weeks ago, I started feeling that the idea of dating was starting to feel like a chore. I was getting bored of meeting somebody online or in person, asking the same questions, trying to force the connection I‚Äôm looking for and just realizing it wasn‚Äôt happening. So I paused all my profiles. 

L and I are still in regular contact. We both keep pretty busy. We both have kids and jobs, etc. 

Last week she asked about how last Sunday was. Super Bowl is a holiday for me. It was the last planned date that I had. It was one of the most fun dates that I have ever been on. Still, no romantic connection to the person though. I started to think about it on my drive home. How I just wanted to feel that connection I felt with L again and how high she set the bar.

So, I told her that. I told her how heart of a time I had on Sunday but I had no plans of seeing that person again. She asked why and I just let it out. 

I told her that I had been trying to replicate this connection that I had felt with her and while it is possible, that every time I‚Äôm out on a date, I was wishing it was just her there with me. 

She asked to come over and talk and that‚Äôs what we did. 

Thoughout the last couple of years, I‚Äôve been in therapy figuring things out about myself. Part of that is being able to express myself and not letting the fear of being vulnerable overtake the wheel. 

So we‚Äôre currently exploring of being together is what we both want. 

Have you ever tried to rekindle an old flame? Or been in a similar situation? Is it a good idea or an I trying to fool myself?","10 months ago I went on 3 great dates with an amazing man. We had one of those instant connections where we felt completely understood by each other. Unfortunately something felt a little off for me (probably me having an internal freak out that this could be something real, also he admitted he wasn't in a space to fully commit just yet). So I ended things. 

Anyway. He tested for Covid shortly after that and contacted me to let me know I should probably test myself in case he passed it on. We started talking again. Had a bit of a situationship for a couple of months, then agreed to be platonic friends because he didn't want to stop me from finding what I wanted. 6 months of friendship later, he finally admitted he had feelings for me. He'd been waiting till he was completely sure he could give me what I wanted. 

That was only a few days ago but it feels incredibly right this time. I've never felt so supported and comfortable around someone. I think having those months of friendship, getting to know each other with no pressure was what we needed this time. 

I think it can work if you're willing to be completely open and honest.

She told me she was looking for a monogamous deal - no problem let‚Äôs see where this goes. 

One thing she made clear early on - she wants to wait a bit to have sex until we‚Äôre exclusive. No problem, I‚Äôm very happy to respect what anyone wants to do with their body.

A couple of weeks in we‚Äôre playing truth or dare and through a dare I end up finding out she‚Äôs dating someone else as well - she tells me about them (they‚Äôre very impressive, multiple phds from elite universities etc - I‚Äôm no slouch myself but that‚Äôs an interesting piece of information to choose to share). Now in a secure poly relationship this wouldn‚Äôt be an issue for me and I don‚Äôt mind hearing about dates my partners are on - it‚Äôs cute to see them excited and other partners aren‚Äôt competition - but this is an either or situation - it bugged me and I mentioned as much.

Now she‚Äôs telling me she‚Äôs not sure if she wants to be poly or monogamous, nor is she in a place where she‚Äôs ready to choose. We had originally had what felt like good momentum in the early dating but I‚Äôve had to pull back emotionally in response to her uncertainty, and honestly it feels like I‚Äôm getting the same from her. 

I guess I‚Äôm looking for opinions on whether you would see where it goes without investing too much (tricky because I do like her a lot) or cut it now and say that if she finds herself feeling more sure she should get back in touch. I really doubt that‚Äôll happen though, she‚Äôs a catch!",I'm concerned that it took a truth or dare for her to tell you about other partners.. and also that she's not sure she wants poly or mono. Did you initially tell her you were looking for monogamy? Did she ever indicate her preference?

datingoverthirty,116rz25,1676850719.0,How have you personally improved your rate of second dates?,"Pretty much what the title asks: if you used to frequently get turned down for second dates, but then you changed something and it got better - what was wrong, and what did you change?

I'm a guy, I get enough first dates; about 70% of the time I'm not interested in a second - and about 70% of the rest she's not interested, so only one in 10 first dates or so turns into a second (and then maybe one in several seconds turns into a third and usually a relationship). 

Obviously, I would love to get turned down less frequently by people I like.

I don't know whether I get turned down because they're simply not attracted to who I actually am (perfectly fine - I'm happy with who I am, not looking to change that), or because I'm doing something on the date that is a turn-off but could have been avoided.

So I'm curious **what have y'all done that has worked for you personally** in terms of improving your chances of a second date (rather than increasing the number of first dates)? I wonder if some of it will be things I can borrow, too.","Aggressively screening profiles, even if it means not having any matches (33 M here BTW, so this bit doesn‚Äôt take too long lol). Keeps bad faith actors at bay.

Once that‚Äôs taken care of, I usually end the first date by offering to take the tab and suggesting they take the next one. Works fabulously - the ones who aren‚Äôt interested insist on splitting, the ones who are can be drawn into figuring a next date. And having that chat in person is a whole lot more illuminating than a follow-up text."

datingoverthirty,1166tcz,1676800911.0,I don‚Äôt know how to date anymore,"Sooo, here I am, literally a bit at loss about the whole dating scene.. and guys, I have to admit that I really have no idea how the dating game works anymore.
I haven‚Äôt extensively dated in the past because I was mostly in relationships, I married and then divorced. And in between finding a stable guy (okay it didn‚Äôt work out in a forever term but I can‚Äôt complain really) I‚Äôd basically date briefly and then I‚Äôd find the one. So it‚Äôd usually be like‚Ä¶ long term partner, one situationship, then long term partner. If this makes any sense

I got my heart broken last autumn after a 4 month thing with a guy, took my time off, went to therapy, stayed with my mum for like 40 days to get my pieces back together and Jan came, I felt kinda ready to put myself back out there. 

I went on a date with 14 different guys, all nice dates but majority I just didn‚Äôt feel like I wanted to go on a second date with, as chemistry wasn‚Äôt there for me, or for other compatibility reasons. Out of those, 3 stuck out. 

Guy 1
Now, the guy I liked the most, we ended up having an emotional connection over 3 weeks, had an amazing weekend together that felt very like boyfriend and girlfriend, to then have him tell me he doesn‚Äôt see us long term (I have a big dealbreaker that I‚Äôd rather not disclose but I can‚Äôt have my own family unless it‚Äôs through adoption/surrogacy)
I was Gutted to be fair, We parted ways on a good term as we had a heart felt conversation when the dust settled.

Guy 2‚Ä¶ I got to know him recently, I was extremely attracted to him. Spent valentines together, he cooked for us. Didn‚Äôt expect it but I ended up sleeping over at his. I expressed my interest in exploring more our connection but I have received little feedback so‚Ä¶ I feel like maybe he isn‚Äôt that into me? 

Guy 3.. I get on with him like a house on fire, we are on date 4, but I don‚Äôt feel that level of chemistry that I usually go for. Tho I feel attracted to him, and we have really fun dates so far. I had sex with him on date 3. It was okay for me. Just okay. 
Also he‚Äôs younger and im not sure. Like at the moment I‚Äôm still keeping my options open as there‚Äôs no exclusivity between us. He‚Äôs super local to me , so it‚Äôs easy to organise seeing each other.

Dating nowadays‚Ä¶seems like it‚Äôs becoming such a minefield. I prefer to multi date because I tend to get attached. But obviously if I find one I feel strongly about, I‚Äôm happy to explore and focus on that. I‚Äôd have stopped at guy 1 really , but it just wasn‚Äôt meant to be 
For some odd reasons, it‚Äôs turning into the guys I want don‚Äôt seem to want me, and vice versa. 

Am I doing dating completely wrong? How can I improve things? 

Personally I don‚Äôt think you can fabricate relationships and I believe that if it‚Äôs meant to happen, it will. Also I‚Äôm really realising how it isn‚Äôt as easy to connect with individuals on that level.

datingoverthirty,116e2ij,1676819885.0,Some days I just want to feel miserable and sorry for myself and do nothing about it.,"
Tldr : rejection sucks/I‚Äôm struggling to get out of this rut.

It‚Äôs been exactly 6 weeks since my breakup. I went straight into no contact after the breakup. His bday was three weeks after the breakup and I didn‚Äôt bother to wish him too. 

I‚Äôve noticed the pain scale going up the last few days feeling somewhat closer to the days of anxiety I felt when I was mentally preparing myself for the breakup.
I seemed to be doing extremely well one week post the break up. 


Then, I somehow ended up having a bad breakdown 20 days later and then multiple ones in the last two weeks especially.
As humans, we pity ourselves and I feel like I‚Äôm not trying hard enough to get myself out of this mess. 


While I‚Äôve truly been trying my hardest to eat well, gym like before , work on my goals, be involved in my hobbies, spend more time by myself for self reflection and processing my loss, while being kind to myself, I‚Äôve really not been able to get myself out of feeling miserable on many days a week. 


While I also know I‚Äôve been trying so hard and to be kinder to myself during these times, I just feel like I‚Äôm not trying hard enough and hate myself and then my ex for making me feel absolutely miserable and broken and messy. 
Some days I‚Äôm a complete mess these days and do not wish to do anything. 
I find him crossing my mind often. I didn‚Äôt hate him before but now, I‚Äôm often angry at him for making me feel this miserable on days. 


We mutually ended it because he didn‚Äôt want the relationship. The parting was amicable. 
But the feeling of not being wanted /rejection is coming to bite me now and no matter how much I try, it hurts. 


Why am I still hoping he regrets his decision even when I know I wouldn‚Äôt want to be back with this person anymore. While he wasn‚Äôt right, he wasn‚Äôt also exactly in the wrong and when confronted a second time, he was honest about it. 
The grieving cycle is so unpredictable and I‚Äôm just finding it so hard to get myself out of this slump even when I know everything I need to do to heal.


I thought I was ready to be on apps but realised I wasn‚Äôt and have gone off it completely now. 

In your experiences, what helped you ged rid of such thoughts? Wanting my ex to regret, hating him for making me feel this way even though he wasn‚Äôt exactly in the wrong and just couldn‚Äôt give me what I wanted. 


Or is it the cliche but truth that time will heal and I won‚Äôt be forever stuck in this rut. I just feel so miserable these days.
Any help would be appreciated. 

I‚Äôve been eating well and gymming last two weeks after almost 2weeks break due to travel/feeling miserable on days but it‚Äôs just not enough.
Edit - I‚Äôve also been journaling and noting down how I feel. I think I‚Äôll try to start meditation /breath-work too again. It should help me.","You can do everything right but your heart is gonna feel what it's gonna feel. Personally it took me years before I could think of my ex without feeling hatred and resentment tbh I also had very unhealthy coping skills. 
BUT

You seem to be doing everything you should do to try and help yourself feel better so right now I think all you need is time. Just keep fighting through the lows bc there is a light at the end of the tunnel

Edit; just to add meeting new people in a platonic way can be very helpful with filling that loneliness without being in another relationship"
datingoverthirty,1169jnd,1676811042.0,Realized I‚Äôm in Situationship. Should I push for a relationship or move on?,"I [33M] came out of a 6 year relationship last summer. One month later was set up with a former colleague [31F] and been dating exclusively since (roughly 6 months). 

When I look at what we are, I would have thought we‚Äôd have developed more. Whilst we agreed to be exclusive, we haven‚Äôt said we‚Äôre ‚Äòofficial‚Äô. We do nice things together like dates, celebrate our birthdays and valentines etc., But she won‚Äôt hold my hand in public and she doesn‚Äôt bring me to things with her friends and parties.

She‚Äôs admittedly an ‚Äòavoidant‚Äô type and I‚Äôve been through a lot of change myself recently (move, new job) so was avoiding having this talk about our situation until around now. The last time we spoke about it it 3 months ago didn‚Äôt go well, I raised a few of these concerns and she just denied it, said she was trying then got upset. 

Every time I see her I want to see her again but I can‚Äôt shake the feeling that she‚Äôs not right for the long term. Should I know by now if it‚Äôs right or not? I‚Äôm just concerned if I try to push for a relationship and it‚Äôs still not right then I might end up upsetting her. 

As always, any advice you could give would be much appreciated!","Since 3 months have passed since you last brought it up, I think it would be a good idea to bring it up once again and if she doesn't want to be excluse or avoids the conversation it is better to move on. It looks like you want something long term and she might not be it.

Whatever the case, good luck!"

datingoverthirty,115wrv2,1676766828.0,How to get over the delusion that they will regret leaving you?,"For some context: I met someone at a bar that my friends and would go to regularly - he and I hooked up for months before I realized I was starting to catch feelings. Once I did, I made my intentions clear -I wasn't going to do the casual relationship situationship thing. At first, he expressed that he wasn't looking for a relationship so I closed the door. He called me the next day and decided to give a relationship a shot. Things were going seemingly fine (to me) for several months but out of the blue (to me) he broke up with me saying he couldn't give me what I needed. I felt incredibly blindsided at the time. We stupidly hooked up on a handful of occasions after that - which is something I do regret. I know I should have turned away without looking back.

In retrospect, the writing was always on the wall. He made his intentions clear & ultimately couldn't be the partner that I'm looking for - someone who is present and consistent. And there are some significant incompatibilities that make me realize we couldn't work out regardless.

**But here's where I'm struggling** \- I have this weird delusion that he's going to regret leaving me. That I'm the one who got away and it will pain him when he realizes it. As if it's some romantic film that we're main characters in. But the reality is he doesn't and never will care. He's not pining over me - he intentionally left me. How do I shake this delusion? Anyone else stuck with these intrusive thoughts? 

I started going to therapy which made me realize my turbulent upbringing with my father has caused me to emotionally attach to unavailable men. But recently my health insurance changed and I can't afford the sessions anymore just as I was trying to make some progress - anyone have advice for overcoming traumatic bonds?","Have you completely cut contact with him? Deleted and blocked his number, blocked him on social media, erased all his messages? That's a good starting point. You know the door needs to be closed, so close it and lock it.

And then just feel your feelings. It's not unusual to have these fantasies that your ex will come crawling back, that he'll have magically changed into the perfect partner and realized that you're his soulmate. Hell, I still have this idle fantasy about most of my exes, it's just a little ego boost. As long as you are 100% aware that it's a fantasy and has no basis in reality, it's not harmful at this stage in your healing process.

The issue will be if you can't get let go of this guy as time passes. Right now it's raw and fresh and he's going to be living rent-free in your head for a while. But find healthy ways to distract yourself -- call your friends, join a new social group, etc. Concentrate on healing yourself and he'll fade from your mind."
datingoverthirty,115qxw5,1676753813.0,How to approach uncomfortable conversations,"TLDR: 30F/34M got back together after a short 1st run, 3months into the ‚Äúsecond round‚Äù: how to approach these hard topics (Chemistry is off, I don‚Äôt feel valued/wanted, sex needs improving, is there enough there that it‚Äôs worth it work on, etc) without sounding mean or personal and avoiding a kick to his self esteem?

I‚Äôve started seeing this guy again in December that I had dated for a short while before, but the whole dynamic seems so different and the chemistry feels very off now.

We‚Äôve decided at the beginning to take it slow, as to not jump into something super serious straight away since we already dated before etc. 

I‚Äôve already tried to touch on the subject a few times, that he‚Äôs not very affectionate and it feels to me like he‚Äôs forcing himself into it. And because of it not being reciprocated, I‚Äôve stopped myself being affectionate as well, now it‚Äôs all feeling very off (at least to me).

We only see each other once a week, if that. In the beginning it was mainly me initiating it and admittedly now I‚Äôve kind of stopped so it‚Äôs been mostly him asking if I want to do something. It‚Äôs all very casual.

I‚Äôm honestly not sure if there‚Äôs enough there for us to ‚Äúwork on‚Äù, but he‚Äôs a great guy, very nice person, and I want to give this a fair chance. We have a lot in common and we rarely run out of topics to talk about, but it‚Äôs also all very superficial, he doesn‚Äôt really try to get a little deep in conversation. When I asked he said he‚Äôs into me and into this and it‚Äôs just not in his nature or personality to be super affectionate and he‚Äôll try, but I feel like the actions don‚Äôt reflect the words. The sex is not good either.

I understand how this sounds like an obvious ‚Äújust break up‚Äù post, and I guess I‚Äôm 75% there already but (as a lot of you will probably understand) dating is horrible nowadays, especially after turning 30. So, as I said before, I want to give it a fair chance.

My title question: how to approach these hard topics (Chemistry is off, I don‚Äôt feel valued/wanted, sex needs improving, is there enough there that it‚Äôs worth it work on, etc)? He can be defensive, and sometimes gets pouty when confronted with some hard truths. 

I‚Äôve said a couple times I need more affection and more enthusiasm in bed, and seen very little to no improvement. Kinda starting to feel like a broken record at this point.

We haven‚Äôt stablished exclusivity, if that makes any difference. And I saw today his profile is still up on hinge (but then, I was on the app myself so ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è). Just feels like we‚Äôre both kind of treating each other as place holder until something better comes along, maybe? How do I say all this without sounding mean and personal, and avoiding a kick to his self-esteem?

datingoverthirty,115p7rw,1676751454.0,How to tell your partner you're not ready for them to meet your parents when they've asked to?,"31F recently met my bf's parents. I made a post about whether or not I should based on a conversation I had which led me to perceive that he didn't see a long term future with me. Following the post, I spoke to him some more about the situation and he explained himself further saying that he does in fact see a future with me etc.


I met the parents and it was great. We were having such a good time that we didn't leave the restaurant until closing. They had very nice things to say about me afterwards.

That very evening, he hinted about meeting mine. I didn't really respond as he wasn't direct. He has now brought it up directly. For context, we have gotten closer since I met his; we see each other more often and I have a key to his place.

Thing is, I'm not quite ready for him to meet mine and I'm not sure how to communicate that without making him think I'm not serious about him. I am. But I also have a lot of personal issues that I need to work through, if not fully, then at least to a significant degree in order to be a better partner. I don't want to involve my parents until I'm at a better place emotionally so that by then, if he and I continue to be serious about each other, the topic of a future together would be something we can all discuss comfortably.

What do I say that doesn't send the message that I'm not serious about him?","‚ÄúI‚Äôm serious about you and want to be with you long term, but my relationship with my parents is complicated and something I‚Äôm still working on.

datingoverthirty,11546qb,1676686053.0,No contact‚Ä¶will it work?,"Long story short. Me and this guy dated for a while, once it got down to being more serious, he couldn‚Äôt commit. Fast forward, we‚Äôre now in a sticky situation where we just hang out, hook up and nothing happens. He doesn‚Äôt want a relationship right now and that‚Äôs where the conversation stops. We‚Äôve tried going no contact a few times and it never works for one reason or another. When we hang out, it‚Äôs usually like all day and night, and majority of the time we are completely sober. I don‚Äôt know if that means anything, but the point is, we don‚Äôt really do booty calls. In my ideal world, he‚Äôd realize he‚Äôs ready, he‚Äôd realize we have fun and have a connection, he‚Äôd want to date me. If I really disappear this time will he realize what he‚Äôs missing? Will he forget about me? I‚Äôm probably being ridiculous wanting him to change his mind about me, but I really like him and think it could be serious if he allowed himself to open up and for us to fully try being together.

datingoverthirty,1153v3k,1676685096.0,Am I being ghosted?,"I (33F) was dating a guy (45) for the past 5 months, two of which were long distance due to my work. Things were looking very hopeful until he had to travel for work after the holidays and the communication just declined. After having a talk about intimacy/vulnerability, or the lack of it outside of the physical, he shared that he might not be able to be as vulnerable as I would like. He also mentioned that he did not want to be a boyfriend and said that he was feeling ""pressure"" when I was just desiring a check-in and a more clear set of expectations for us both. He pretty much shut down and wouldn't express himself.

I was expressing what was not working for me - lack of communication, uncertainty about how often I should expect to see him, etc. When I asked him what was working for him (which he'd said he liked how things were) he could/would not say, but kept asking me to repeat myself and I started to feel overly exposed. I suggested we get off the phone because ""this wasn't working for me"" (the conversation or how things had become, of which I communicated in the moment). We didn't talk for most of the next day so I reached out via text expressing how I was not a fan of the way our last two conversations ended and was open to offering him space if that is what he needed. He expressed that it was - that it seemed we'd come to a head - even after saying that he was really enjoying how things were going.

I agreed to ""taking space"" - he was going on a trip for two weeks so we wouldn't be seeing one another due to that anyway. I did reach out once before he left asking if we were really ""taking space"" and the response I got was very cold. That was the end of last month. He went on his trip and is now back, but I have not heard from him. It'll be almost 3 weeks of not talking and a month of not having seen each other. I feel like I have been ghosted, but I'm not 100% sure. We never specified any amount of time, but I am getting to a point where it's really getting to me and I would like clarity. However, I don't want to reach out because I did once before and it was as if we'd never shared any sweet intimate moments. Should I reach out to confirm the seemingly obvious or just accept that things are indeed done?

&#x200B;

UPDATE: Wow. Leave it to reddit to offer up some very harsh truths, even when tone is giving insensitive. However, I appreciate the responses because I was feeling very dumb about not admitting the obvious. I guess I would've never seen this as a breakup because the relationship was undefined. No less, I am feeling resolved, after a few good cries,  which is what I've been inching towards these past few weeks. Glad to be in a space of healing, learning, and moving the fuck on!","Accept it‚Äôs over and move on.

datingoverthirty,113ykau,1676575041.0,"Hinge Profile Review, 32M","Hey all, just looking for some unbiased feedback / first impressions on my profile.  

I've spent the last 3-4 years being single on purpose, looking inward and trying to figure myself out because I've historically always found myself in unhealthy and/or lopsided relationships, so I feel like I'm really trying to date as this ""version of myself"" for the first time, if that makes sense.

I've tried to include a little bit of everything that I think is important - hobbies, friends, dating goals, pictures of not just my face, etc.  In real life, I'm the ""emotional support himbo"" friend, and I'm usually pretty quiet by default in group settings but I like having introspective conversations whenever someone wants to have deep talks.  I don't really try to hide that I can be a goof, but I also know when to turn it off and be serious, and my friends in real life can attest to the fact that I can balance that - but I feel like that's a bit hard to display in a dating profile.  I don't really like to hide who I am anymore, so I'd rather people have a more transparent impression of me upfront, rather than several months/a year+ in.


Other info not pictured:

* Height:  5'11""
* Children:  Don't have, don't want
* Drinking:  sometimes/rarely
* Smoking: no
* Weed:  sometimes / very rarely
* Drugs:  sometimes ~~(I don't display this answer because of the stigma - I've found psychedelics to be a really useful additive in my mental health toolbox, in intentional ways / controlled settings.  I'm not the type of person to to ***TAKE 5 TABS AND HEADBANG TO EXCISION, BRO*** but I've found more often than not that people see ""Drugs"" and immediately start assuming/labelling.  I take harm reduction very seriously, but I don't put this info upfront on my profile because I feel like this is worthy of explaining in detail, with an in-person conversation)~~

edit: y'all make a good point, if the whole idea that I'm going for is to try and be transparent that I'm introspective and a goof and weirdo overall, it makes more sense to apply consistency to that principle. If a potential match is/was uncomfortable about it or it's a dealbreaker without me being able to explain my side, then I'd rather not even waste anyone's time.


edit: removed.  all feedback is appreciated. <3","Not gonna lie this is one of those rare cases where your pictures actually showed everything I needed to know. If you asked me what my presumptions where about you based off your bio I'd basically presume everything you wrote. So.. nothing surprising to me.

datingoverthirty,113xdpo,1676572058.0,Exclusivity,"(38F) One of my boundaries is that in order to get sexually intimate with a partner, we have to be exclusive. For me, this doesn't imply commitment beyond ""neither of us is pursuing nor sleeping with anyone else at this time,"" but it does mean not seeing anyone else. I also have a tendency to get intimate fairly early on (historically within 2 - 5 dates) which means having the exclusivity talk quite quickly. I don't typically get pushback, I guess because I tend to end up dating men who aren't multi-daters anyway, so I never really thought about. 

But reading through posts here, I've found that a lot of people seem reluctant to discuss exclusivity until there's a more defined relationship. I'm curious if people who wait for 2 or 3 months (or more) view exclusivity as a more solid commitment? Is my boundary (no other sexual partners while we're sleeping together) unusually restrictive? Or do people differentiate ""not sleeping with anyone else"" and ""exclusive"" in a way that I'm unaware of?","At this point in my life.. I'm just *busy*. Like the one or two nights a week I dedicate towards dates is all I can manage anyway before I want to spend my free time alone.

So even if I wanted to multidate I couldnt. So I'm basically exclusive from date 1 until I stop seeing you. I typically only date people who are the same way so it hasnt been an issue.

People who plan 3-4 dates a week with different people are crazy to me. When I'm dating I see 1 new person a week typically."
datingoverthirty,113ugg3,1676564545.0,"After 6 months of using OLD, I'm starting to think I'm the problem here","So, this pretty much sucks. And right now, I feel really bad about this situation. 

To give a brief story. I moved to Europe 6 months ago and started using OLD. And to my surprise, the number of matches and dates I have had here compared to my country is really high. But please don't get me wrong. I don't want to sound like an ego douchebag here. 

The thing is. I could say that I have constantly been dating someone each month, and then something happens like she gets distant, doesn't want a serious relationship, get back with her ex-bf, and lastly, I lose interest in her (that already happened to me twice).

I've been trying to analyze what could have been wrong because the behavior is so weird. To put a few examples. I was really into one girl a few months ago. Everything was amazing. One day, she sent me a voice message planning a trip in her car, picking me up at my apartment, etc., and two days later, I received a long text message saying this was going too fast for her. She's not ready for something serious, that her ex-bf situation is complicated, and so on. I was so surprised because I was totally not expecting something like that, and we were constantly dating for maybe one month. 

Another example could be that I got hospitalized for kidney stones on New Year's Eve. At the time, I was knowing a girl who offered to visit me at the hospital and even bring me some of my stuff from my apartment. That was such a nice gesture because I was struggling at the time. After a couple of days, we continued dating. We had sex, and a couple of days later, I received a long text message saying she didn't feel a connection and we shouldn't continue dating and not going to lie. That created a bit of insecurity in my sexual life.  

And lastly, this happened to me today. After like two weeks of chatting with this new girl, we went on a couple of dates last week, and we saw once this week. It was pretty consistent, and she was the one that planned the dates. I didn't want to push too hard there. So, last Monday, she went to my apartment, I cooked something, and it was a lovely night. We kissed, and I got the feeling that everything was good. Today, again, a long message saying that she's overwhelmed with social life and she doesn't want to disappoint me because of that. 

After all of this, I don't know what's happening, and I'm starting to think it's my personality. I can get a lot of second and third dates, but something is definitely going on when things start to get serious. I'm an average guy who likes to work out, enjoy good food, have deep conversations, be spontaneous, a bit introverted, etc.","I‚Äôll attract the ire of internet denizens here, but this is what using OLD yields. Theoretically, it‚Äôs a platform to put yourself out there and cast a wide net to find a good partner, but practically it functions like a lazy stopgap for real human interaction. Attracts a lot of people half out of relationships, seeking attention/validation, relieving boredom, etc. just the sort of person that‚Äôs only willing to half-ass the thing. Couple that with the amount of attention it demands and the illusion of choice it presents, and those are antithetical to forming healthy relationships.

Not an absolute, but chances are the sort of person that could use it in a productive way is not turning to it for their next relationship. I do know success stories, grain of salt, etc, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a strictly ‚Äúyou‚Äù problem. I think the problem is turning to OLD."
datingoverthirty,113jmb3,1676527638.0,Situationships: Guaranteed dead end? Any success stories?,"Interested to hear people's experiences and thoughts around ""situationships"".

My assumption is that if dating ends up in situationship territory, it's probably a good indicator that that's all it will ever be.

Of course, it depends what you define as a situationship (more than x dates/months, implicitly exclusive), but a healthy relationship is founded on honesty and communication, which are two elements often missing in situationships.

I feel like the second you define your ""thing"" even unconsciously as a situationship implicitly acknowledges that communication and clear expectations aren't there. If that's not fixed quickly, then there's no converting it to a serious, healthy relationship.

Looking for other perspectives, has anyone has success stories from a situationship, or are these always doomed?",[deleted]
datingoverthirty,113l5xc,1676533622.0,"She (30F) wants to have casual sex with women while maintaining a long-distance situationship with me (33M), in case she decides to return to the U.S.","**Background.** She (30F) is an expat who has spent nearly a decade on a different continent teaching English and recently visited our home city between semesters for roughly five weeks. I'm also a former English teacher and expat with significant experience working in her ""dream career"" after living abroad. Her father, who knows me from a professional relationship with my family, connected us in order for me to provide her career advice as he'd very much like her to return to our home city.

**First Meeting.** When we first met for tea her first week back, things were ""business informal"" as I discussed the sector, potential opportunities in higher education, and potential introductions with leaders in this ""dream career"" space, especially since she may come home in as early as six months. I was struck by her kindness and beauty, and we began to discuss interests, hobbies, and the personal nuances of returning home after living abroad. We decided to extend the meet to lunch at a nearby restaurant, and by the end of that, we hugged and I asked her if she'd like to go on a ""real date"".

**First Dates & Managing Expectations.** Five weeks, eight dates, and three sleepovers later, and we're now comfortable describing ourselves as ""dating"". We had a particularly special Valentine's Day since, normally, neither of us go out of our ways to celebrate it. However, we've managed our expectations throughout this entire experience, and she's made it clear that she's not guaranteed that she'll return in six months. Moreover, we'd both set out to work on ourselves, enjoy being single, and avoid the dating space before, coincidentally, meeting each other and reconsidering those endeavors. She's expressed in various ways that she simply isn't comfortable committing to any sort of relationship, or even the possible promise of a relationship, before returning abroad. I'm strangely at peace with this, mind you, and genuinely appreciated and enjoyed her company, physical affection, and emotional connection without expectations, though we're clearly growing more fond of one other during this time. There was an unusually steady sort of maturation in our friendship and relationship that I've rarely, if ever, experienced - such that we'd been on over a half dozen dates before we'd finally slept with each other on Valentine's Day. I've never been on that many dates before sleeping with someone. 

**Developing Feelings.** Tomorrow is the last night we'll see each other before she returns abroad and, admittedly, I've been feeling a bit down, but I knew this day would come. We exchange some sweet but terse texts before saying goodnight, but I feel compelled to text her a few more sweet somethings but restrain myself. Some time later I receive a text from her saying that she is only now feeling all these emotions hit her at once - she wanted to wait until she returned to really experience it, but now she is crying, feeling ""grateful and overwhelmed"", and ""deeply affected"". I call her.

**Defining Our Relationship.** At this point, we're still lightly treading around discussing the future. I have told her not long before that six months to finish her teaching contract is not a long time to wait, especially for someone like her, and that it's something I'd further discuss if she wanted that. We talk at length, eventually getting to a point where she wants to describe what we are - for our shared clarity. That is, how she might describe us to someone while she's living abroad. She settles on ""talking to someone"" as a status with which she's comfortable. I'm comfortable with this, and add that, contextually, we might say we are a ""friend"" or ""more than friends"", depending. 

**Honesty & Disclosure.** I explain that I have no expectations for exclusivity at this point, but I do expect honesty. This brings us to a point in the discussion where she wants us to define the degree of physical involvement that warrants disclosing it to one another. I'm not comfortable making myself emotionally available to multiple women at once and wouldn't feel comfortable kissing other women, let alone having sex with them, while keeping that from her - which, functionally, is practically exclusivity. She feels similarly with other men or, at least, it's quite a process for a relationship with a man to become sexual, and she's comfortable disclosing that well ahead of time. 

**Sex with Other Women.** Where this conversation took an unexpected turn is that she's fairly eager to have sex with other women, such that it is not a process to do so, and she would be comfortable with one night stands and sexual experiences with women that she does not know well or at all. I knew she was bisexual and learned tonight that she had a month-long sexual relationship with another woman fairly recently, which was somewhat of a new experience - she believes that, since it ""isn't emotional"" and ""purely physical"" for her, it doesn't mean anything. I began to get a bit more pensive and explained that it's still important to me. She then explained that, due to her very religious and conservative parents, living abroad is really the only way she believes she can truly ""experience"" this aspect of her sexuality, and part of her not wanting to commit to anything is to be able to have these sorts of experiences with other women. 

**How I'm Feeling & Request for Advice.** I'm now fairly confused. I've managed my expectations per her caveats and felt comfortable with the very real possibility of never seeing her again, despite developing some reasonable hope for a possible future together. Even if it's a long-distance ""situationship"" (the purgatorial abyss between ""friends with benefits"" and a relationship) that we'd cultivate over time. But now I'm considering the possibility that she's simply not ready for a relationship or, furthermore, she needs more time to explore this somewhat unexplored aspect of her sexual life that I do not want to impede or stifle, whatsoever. It's made me question what I really want, and whether making myself *emotionally exclusive and available* to someone overseas is really what's best for me, especially if she wants to engage in casual sex with other women. I think I may actually just want to be friends - that somewhere during the course of this conversation, we went from *not necessarily incompatible* to *seemingly incompatible* with only a few utterances. If she could show some semblance of a next step - some modicum of commitment - a token, we could try. But do I even express that? Or is this a situation where my foreboding instincts know better than either of us?",This post is waaay to detailed for a relationship that‚Äôs this paper thin.

datingoverthirty,113c60w,1676504555.0,Questions for OLD.,"I'm a 36M who is recently back in the dating pool after a divorce.  I am generally social awkward and anxious, so interacting with people, especially women I am interested in, does not come easy for me.  So I am just wondering if I could get some points of clarification as I dip my toe back into things. 

1. How much small talk is too much?  I don't want to come across as too eager or pushy, so I try to get to know the person over the course of a few days.  However, more often than not, the interest is gone by that point.  Is a few days too much small talk?
2. What sorts of things do people like to talk about when they are getting to know someone?  I try to usually look for things in someone's profile to talk about, but if they don't have anything I am usually grasping at straws, talking about the weather and where they grew up, which I know is not ideal getting to know you conversation, but I am not sure what else to talk about otherwise.
3.  How soon is too soon to ask someone out? The most success I have had was when someone asked me for my number on day 2.  Would that be too soon for me to make a move?  Again, I just don't want to come across as too eager or pushy.

Thanks in advance for any input.","I don't like to wait - meet them.  Cut to the chase.  As a woman, I like to see the interest level.  We're too old to play games.  If it works, wonderful.  If not, be honest, respectful, and move on.  No ghosting:)"
datingoverthirty,1138rn2,1676495754.0,Looking for advice if this is not just a case of ‚ÄûI don‚Äôt want a relationship (with you)‚Äú,"TLDR; dated a single dad who was traumatized by his last relationship and now only wants to focus on his kid. We had a brief but very special bond but I broke it off after he told me he can‚Äôt fall in love anymore. We have a mutual friend and he wants to stay involved in my life. Is he using his Trauma as an excuse or does it seem like later down the line we could become something?



I (36f) met a wonderful, sensitive and funny (39) man through our mutual good friend about a month ago at a party and we hit it off immediately and spent the night and all of the next day together. We had this instant closeness and companionship that really surprised the both of us. 

I knew he was a father of a young child, but it wasn‚Äôt until we started hanging out regularly that he told me about his actual situation. 

He was never officially with his ex, but she basically tricked him into believing she couldn‚Äôt become pregnant (yes, he‚Äôs aware he also has responsibility in this) and then she did. He communicated upfront that he definitely wants to be involved in the child‚Äôs life but that he wasn‚Äôt in love with her. She started using her pregnancy to her advantage and basically forced a relationship on him if he was to have any custody of the child. He stuck it out until his son was 4 months old and then broke it off with her and moved out, because I guess she was quite awful to him. 
Our mutual friend who has known him since childhood recently mentioned that while all of this was happening he was quite traumatized and lost a lot of weight. 
I never asked for details because that‚Äôs not my place but it is clear that she really pulled a number on him. 

Fast forward to now: he loves his son more than anything in the world and only cares about his well being. She lets him see his son very rarely and is extremely controlling of their hangouts. 

In the span of 4 weeks we hung out 2-3x a week, always a sleep over, always cozy and casual in joggers and just having a really sweet time. I am also dealing with a terminally ill father and he has been so calming for my nervous system in so many ways. 

He never once made me feel like he wasn‚Äôt feeling anything towards me. He texted regularly, we both instigated meet ups and we talked about doing future things together like bike trips, even hanging out with his son (who is 2.5 now).

It was my birthday last weekend and the topic came up of him joining with my friends ; that‚Äôs when he dropped the bomb that he can‚Äôt and won‚Äôt fall in love with anyone right now. His main priority is his son and getting more custody rights. He loves spending time with me, feels safe and close, says I‚Äôm the first person he‚Äôs been sexual with since all of this happened with his son. He wants to continue hanging out with me with or without sex, but needs me to understand that he can‚Äôt build anything with me. He needs get his life and head in order before any romantic interest can be in the picture again. 


I have never been in a situation like this before. I absolutely adore and in no way am I upset with him for putting his son first. But I told him that because of my father and the last also traumatizing 7 dating years for me make me very careful about continuing a situation that is not defined. I need support and stability and can‚Äôt handle if he says he wont develop deep feelings for me at some point. Told him it‚Äôs early between us but I do have feelings for him that will become deeper if we continue this. 
He told me it‚Äôs not about meeting up with other women, but can‚Äôt give me more right now. 

I told him it breaks my heart but if we want to really be friends, then I need some time and space apart from him and to not contact me for a while. Told him I would reach out when I was feeling ‚Äûlighter‚Äú about us. 
He said he totally understood and will respect my decision but to please reach out if I need him / can be there for me. Says he‚Äôll be happy to hear from me when I do. 

I know I did the right thing for now- we are both, but especially him, not in the right space for a relationship. But I also do wonder deep down, if this was just his way of gently saying he‚Äôs not into me (enough). 

I absolutely do not want to force a friendship as long as I still have feelings for him and I don‚Äôt want him to ever think I‚Äôll push for one but after so many failed dating attempts, I feel like I can‚Äôt trust my instinct on who is emotionally available or not. 

I‚Äôm unfortunately not in the mood at all to try and date other people right now but I do really need some advice on how to let guy out of my heart. It really felt like it could have turned into something special üòî

UPDATE:

Wow, wasn‚Äôt expecting such a big resonance to my post. Thank you to everyone who so thoughtfully responded. 

I feel much better now about breaking things off when I did. It is unfortunately a pattern of mine that I get involved too quickly and it is something I am really trying to work on; I am noticing that the common denominator is always alcohol. When we met I was in absolutely no way trying to date, but I guess the night we met we were both so starved for intimacy that we BOTH let things go too far. This is not just on him, I could have also easily asked him during our meet ups what we were doing. I was trying to feel him out myself when it was him that dropped the bomb. 

I truly believe he not ready to get involved with anyone because of his past relationship. My two good friends who know him well (who also have a kid) and also know his ex, confirmed that he is a really good guy and that what happened was and is horrible. They don‚Äôt really understand why he says he can‚Äôt love, but do we ever really know the people in our lives? 

Either way it doesn‚Äôt matter. I have deleted his number and am moving on. It will take me a few weeks for this to settle but I know I‚Äôll get over it. I have other men in my life whom I‚Äôve had feelings for that I‚Äôm now great friends with and I think in due time, if we both want it, a friendship could happen. But thank you to everyone for stating it like it is.","In my opinion, the right person at the wrong time is still the wrong person. He told you where he's at, you need to accept it and move on unfortunately. Four weeks isn't much time to truly get to know someone, try not to obsess about the potential based on that month. It's good that you had an honest talk about where ya'll are at before it went any further."

Edit: 
Thank you, everyone for this amazing feedback! I was not expecting this kind of a response... nor to receive so many compliments. I doubt my mom has 50 accounts (or knows what reddit is), so it is encouraging.

I swipe right on almost any woman who doesn't have or want kids, is mono, is not a wannabe influencer, BMI < 30, and doesn't remind me of [Lily Allen's ""The Fear""](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wGMlSuX_c). If those are unrealistic standards... poop.

I will heed your advice and try to get some better photos. Also, Invisalign. I'm not sure if my female friends would be comfortable handling my profile but I will ask.

I get my fashion inspiration from Ralph Nader and have no idea what good glasses look like.","You‚Äôre a good-looking guy and you‚Äôre obviously smart but your profile is doing you no favours.

You're on Bumble so you don't need to mention being child-free in your prompt, you already say ""Don't Want Kids"" on your profile. Also weird to lead with ""never married"" and ""monogamous"". The former is irrelevant and the latter tends to come up on people's profiles or in conversation, so why lead with it? 

Your first prompt should be about YOU, not what you want. The section is called ""About Alex"", after all. Think of writing a blurb about why someone should date you, not what you want.

Your two truths and a lie are boring except the Bernie story. Change the prompt or the stories because losing weight and not being on social media are not interesting facts.

You list too many interests and most of them aren't exactly conversation starters e.g. ""recycling"". Consider sharing a fun fact or two there instead.

I like the takeout and old movies prompt, no edits there for me. 

Your pictures need work. I can tell you used to be a size XL because you‚Äôre swimming in your clothes. Find better fitting clothes that don't add bulk. For you, pick solid coloured shirts. I also think you could get more ‚Äúhip‚Äù glasses because your current ones are aging you. [These might work.](https://www.pinterest.ca/pin/639440847068668525/)

None of your photos are good. Get a friend to take photos of you in decent lighting, smiling and head-on. You're an attractive doctor and have lots to be confident about - you want pictures that capture that confidence. Your current ones do not. 

Edited to add: I do think you'll be swimming in matches with a better profile."

And, this is something that is holding me back to initiate physical touches on hand/shoulder so that I can gauge the possibility of a kiss (& beyond later on). 

Is it a solvable problem? If yes, should I be talking about this at such an early stage?

If no, will i get used to it?","Almost every single woman naturally has some sort of facial hair. Obviously I don't know what she looks like, so I don't know how much you're talking about. You absolutely should NOT say anything about it to her. If she's happy with how she is then she shouldn't be changing it for you (or anyone else for that matter). The only reason she should get rid of it is if she wants to do it for herself. If it's something you can't deal with then that's a you problem and it's probably best that you move on if you don't think you'll ever be able to see past it.

Btw I'm not trying to have a go at you with this, I know we all have things that irk us that we can't see past. If this is one of those things then it means you're not right for each other."
datingoverthirty,111s453,1676343826.0,No kids and never married. What questions should I ask a potential long term partner who has kids?,"I am 35f and have no children but I have always wanted marriage and kids. It just hasn‚Äôt worked out yet. 

I met a guy through a common hobby(39m) who has 3 kids, the youngest being 8 and he has been divorced for a bit. He has amazing qualities and in so many ways, is the kind of guy I have been looking for. He is good father to his kids, has a good amount of emotional intelligence, has a stable career, and is into personal growth, is introspective and reflective, etc. Has a good amount of friends and is really well rounded. I have never dated someone with kids before‚Ä¶ but because of his qualities, I thought I would give it a try‚Ä¶ so before things get really serious, I feel like there‚Äôs a lot of questions I should probably be asking. I expressed right away that I want marriage and to have a kid of my own someday and he said he is open to that. But‚Ä¶ I think I probably should dig deeper into that topic because he told me he did have a vasectomy after his youngest was born that will have to be reversed. He seems to think this shouldn‚Äôt be a dealbreaker because its reversible.... I‚Äôm not sure how hung up on this I should be but I‚Äôm kind of hung up on it.

The other two questions that seem pretty important to me are, 1. What role does he expect a future partner to take in the lives of his kids? 2. Financial stuff‚Ä¶ Is a future partner expected to help fund college educations, etc for these kids? I get that I will be paying for some stuff. But obviously some expenses are much larger than others. Also, I always thought if I got married, I‚Äôd be combining finances, accounts, etc since that is what everyone in my family has always done. But I‚Äôve worked hard to switch careers in my late 20s and I‚Äôm finally am making pretty good money and I‚Äôm not sure I want to combine everything with someone who has so many other responsibilities in their life at this point? Maybe I‚Äôm being selfish? I just don‚Äôt want to lose what I‚Äôve worked so hard for.

I‚Äôve been really holding back and telling him I want to take things slow but it‚Äôs been a few months so he asked me if I could more clearly define what ‚Äúgoing slow‚Äù means to me and what I want in a partner. It made me realize, I‚Äôm only going slow because of all these unknowns‚Ä¶and I'm wasting time and need to figure it out.

What other important questions have you guys asked when dating partners that already have kids? Just looking for advice since this is really new and unknown territory for me and it feels like there‚Äôs probably a lot I‚Äôm missing.","If you want to continue, PLEASE ask all those questions. Please, please do.

I think you‚Äôre being SMART to want to lock down exactly what he expects in terms of your role in the lives of the parenting aspects of the kids. 

Yes, they have a bio mum you don‚Äôt wish to replace, but if you LIVE with a man and his kids, of course you will have SOME form of a parenting role - ie if you ask them to clean their rooms, and they say ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt have to listen to you because you‚Äôre not my mum‚Äô, will your husband back you up when you say ‚ÄòI know I‚Äôm not your mum and I don‚Äôt wish to replace your mum - but I live in the house, too, and I get a say in the household rules as the other adult‚Äô or not? 
That also applies if the kids are with you part time (shared custody with the ex). 

I wish more step parents would ask those questions before marrying parents - especially if the ex is one of those types who will be vile to you and he will just let her because she threatens to withhold his kids! You don‚Äôt want to get involved in that sort of mess! 

As for the finances - I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs selfish or wrong to consider having separate finances. Never mind what ‚Äòeveryone else in your family‚Äô does or doesn‚Äôt do - they aren‚Äôt you and you aren‚Äôt them. If you marry someone with kids, you want to discuss financial expectations - as you said, you WILL be expected to contribute to every day expenses like food and rent and electricity for the home you share with the kids‚Ä¶ but if you don‚Äôt want to contribute to their post high school education, you don‚Äôt have to (for example). So you can separate your finances (at least partially) so you don‚Äôt have to. 

Like I said, please please have these conversations. He wants to move forward and that‚Äôs fair enough. But if you also want to consider moving forward, then having these conversations is so important. You really need to know exactly what both of you expect so you can split if your expectations are too different. 

It‚Äôs better for you, him and the kids if you don‚Äôt progress in a relationship in which you have wildly different expectations. 

Good luck üòä"

datingoverthirty,111nrw2,1676331658.0,I thought I had finally met my person and then he died,"A few months back, I (27F) was in the early stages of seeing 33M and I asked DOT for advice on how to initiate a kiss. It happened, and the pieces fell into place so beautifully. We began seeing each other 2-3 times a week, texted everyday and just had so much fun together. I was always so excited to see him and we had so many adventures planned for spring and summer. I have never been so attracted to someone and have never felt so comfortable with anyone so quickly. He was everything I ever wanted: kind, patient, thoughtful, creative, and so funny. I was starting to see a future with him and marveled at how wonderfully our lives could mesh together. I thought had finally met my person. 


A little over a week ago, I showed up at his door because we had plans. I hadn‚Äôt heard from him in two days, which was odd because he always responded to me. When i hadn‚Äôt heard from him in the first 24 hours I started to worry but thought maybe he was just swamped at work. I had been busy with work too, so I didn‚Äôt have much time to consider it. But when I never heard from him the day that we had plans, I knew something was wrong. I called and knocked on the door more times than I could count before I finally called 911. They had to break down the door. He had passed away in his sleep.


The last week has been a blur. I cried for probably the first three days alone. On the fourth day, I met his family for the first time and we hugged and cried together. I went with them to receive his ashes from the funeral home. I helped them pack up his apartment. I had one last dinner with them last night and they leave today, taking the last bit of him with them. 


I didn‚Äôt realize how much you could grow to care for someone in just 4 short months, and how painful it could feel to lose them. I‚Äôll never get to see his face again, touch him, or hear his voice. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll ever date again, because all I would want is for them to be him. And I‚Äôll never meet anyone remotely like him ever again. 


I miss him so much. Of course I‚Äôm devastated to lose him and to not have him in my life anymore, but I think part of the pain is also mourning the future that we never got to have together.


ETA (2/14/2023): Thank you for all the overwhelmingly kind words and offers of support. I wish I could reply to each comment. I will not disclose his cause of death, it really doesn‚Äôt matter right now. I just want to say, life can be so unexpected - tell your people that you love them, often and unprompted. Today was an especially hard one, but I am doing my best to bask in the beautiful memories I have of him.","Oh my god, I'm so sorry. I have no advice other than give your self as much time as you need to heal and don't be afraid to lean on friends and family in this horrible time. I'm so, so sorry.

My mom died and when I was talking about it with my therapist one day he said ""Just because she's gone, it doesn't mean the relationship you had with her ended. The love you had for each other is still there and always will be. She is still a part of you"".

That perspective helped me a lot. I hope it brings you a tiny bit of comfort."
datingoverthirty,111nbrr,1676330498.0,Why would a guy lie and say he‚Äôs in a relationship when he‚Äôs not?,"So I matched with a guy on a dating app, and we exchanged a few messages. A few days passed and he messaged back (still on the app) that he has recently entered a relationship and that‚Äôs why we didn‚Äôt chat for a few days. So I said thanks for telling me and bid him farewell.

Come to find out, his profile is still active on the dating site and he‚Äôs still matched to me as well.

Not sure why he wouldn‚Äôt just unmatch if he was no longer interested? I feel a little confused about it. So I guess I‚Äôm trying to wonder:

A.) if you are supposedly now in a relationship, why do you still have an active profile?

And 

B.) if you‚Äôre not in a relationship, why lie about it?

I totally would‚Äôve been okay if he would‚Äôve said that he is no longer interested or if he would‚Äôve unmatched. (He never said he wasn‚Äôt interested in me. I am just guessing because he said he is now a relationship but his dating profile remains up).

Any one have any thoughts??","Ignore him still being matched to you. He may have paused his account and left the match in case it doesn't work out, he may reach out to say hello (after all, you two haven't met, yet).

What makes you think he is active on the apps still?

Edit: to add more detail, I've been in situations where I am chatting with someone but decide to pause things to focus on one person. I don't delete my profile because we aren't in a committed relationship, I'm just choosing to only focus on dating her. If I'm talking with someone I haven't met, I'll say so instead of just unmatching, but since we haven't met and I'm not actually rejecting them, I'll leave the match in case things don't work out. If she doesn't want to stay matched she can unmatch, but I don't see any reason to do it myself since my reason for pausing with her isn't lack of interest, just the fact that I got to a place where I wanted to focus on one person after we matched but before we met."
datingoverthirty,111ndpf,1676330641.0,"Asking your friends to set you up, yes or no?","UPDATE: The BIL does *not* have single friends in the area. However, great advice in the comments on the best ways to go about asking to be set-up! I‚Äôll have to really think about what other friends I would ask who I think know me well enough and the type of man I‚Äôd like to be with.

Would it be weird to ask my friend if her BIL has any available friends that may be a match, or even the BIL?
Her in laws are from the area that I‚Äôm now living and the BIL moved back to the area from the city recently (similar situation to me). Her husband‚Äôs friends are all paired up, but his brother is a couple years older and I thought he may know of some available men in the area especially since he moved back.

Is it inappropriate or weird to ask her/her husband to inquire with the BIL?
I‚Äôm starting to lose hope with the apps.","Before dating apps really took off, being introduced by friends/family was the #1 way how couples met and I think it is stil TOP3ish now. So its not weird. That said, you have to factor in the possibility that he might introduce you to somebody you will not like/eventually reject and it might get a bit more awkward vs. ending things with total stranger. 

Pro tip: Do make sure that whatever message you want the BIL to convey will be actually expressed properly **and** the person you are being set up with is aware what is actually happening. I once get invited to dinner by my friends fiance just to find out I was being set up with one of her girlfriends. Not cool."
datingoverthirty,111dc48,1676305817.0,How to let them down tactfully?,"I've been taking a class after work, which is attended by a few single men. Three of them took an interest in me. Let's call them Todd, Rod, and Binkley.

Tl;dr my question is, how do I navigate letting down Rod & Todd gently, and attending the class, after I've begun dating Binkley? What's the etiquette here?

Rod asked me out months ago, but I turned him down because I wasn't available. We've become close friends since then, and started flirting again after my previous relationship ended. However, as much as I like Rod, I also know we have long-term incompatibilities so I never pursued anything further. Given previous things he's hinted at, I believe he would be very hurt that I passed him over for someone else in the class.

Then there's Todd. We have an awkward flirtation going and I believe he wants more, but I find him a little immature so I keep the brakes pumped on that. Still, we'll sit close occasionally and banter and such.

Finally, Binkley apparently had his eye on me for ages, but he's reserved and I didn't even notice. Then we went on a date kind of out of the blue (for me), had a great time, and I want to see how this goes.

What do I do or say to the other guys? How do I prevent awkwardness when we're all at the class together?

PS I don't know why the stupid alternative names.","Stop flirting, and if asked out say sorry I‚Äôm seeing someone now."
datingoverthirty,110zzee,1676264558.0,Met her again after 2 months and she wants to continue?,"So we dated maybe 5 months and 2 months ago she wanted to prep her interview and was pretty silent with occasional holiday greetings. We did meet over the weekend and I had low expectations for sure but gave her benefit of the doubt.

She at dinner did explain her situation - basically, she is a consultant and her company has ""staff"" positions that are really rare and one opened up in december and she and many others were applying for it.  The difference between the roles is mostly benefits and more stability. It was originally a spot  open to everyone and because it was a general position, she had to study various parts of economics and do research as well and had to work and study through the holidays. When end of Jan comes for interviews her department head decided to make it even fairer by not allowing internal employees to apply since it gives ""unfair advantage"". So basically she wasted 2 months of prep and work for nothing. She did say she may have a chance to do well in june by working on her current project and if it becomes important she could potentially create a staff position for herself. 

She also mentioned that she is in better mental state now since the prep period is over so that's good. She also told me she is freezing her eggs (shes 35)  and said their state is very good right now.

I couldn't really counter her with anything but we are meeting tuesday for dinner. 

I am actively looking elsewhere too but if she's back to before and is interested in continuing should i give a shot and see where it goes?","I‚Äôve been following your story for awhile. It never seemed like you guys were truly dating at any point. She was never really physical with you or exclusive, you always wanted more but never got it and tried to hold on hope she would give you more but never would. You‚Äôve given yourself a lot of ultimatums that you never followed.

It seems like she had friendzoned you entirely. Although I think you should move on, you‚Äôre not going to do that with your pattern. At least very clearly identify that you want to date or be in a long term relationship with her and see how she responds. Don‚Äôt try to construe hope in anything that isn‚Äôt a clear yes."

Like, a literal, professional clown. Dave texted me a video of it, and I thought that was hilarious and told Dave to give the clown my phone number because I wanted to be their best friend.

Second date with Dave was yesterday and he walks up to me holding a smiley face balloon. I asked what the fuck the balloon was about, and he said he bought it from the wedding clown to bring to me. It was so completely out of left-field and unexpected and silly. I had to take a good 20 seconds to laugh as I held the balloon and process what was happening. But I was actually quite touched that he made such a small, playful gesture for me. Every time I walk past the balloon I can't help but grin. How delightfully absurd.

I've done therapy, gotten back into hobbies, and learned how to take amazing care of myself.  Today, I went on my first date.  The man (32M) showed up 20 minutes late (I got hit on twice in that time) and didn't apologize for being late.  I moved on from this because stuff happens and started asking about his life.  We had talked about our roommates before on the phone and I asked how he met his.  Turns out, his ""roommate"" is his ex-wife.  I asked him why he thought it was appropriate to not mention this when he spoke of his roommate before on the phone. He said he didn't think living with his ex-wife was a reflag and that they are still really close but just aren't compatible together.  I told him that anyone looking for a serious relationship (as I have in my profile) probably wouldn't take him seriously or at least if I had known this, I wouldn't have bothered coming on the date.  He said he couldn't support himself on his own and I said he should probably work on that stuff before he started bringing in other people into the equation or at least warn people before a date to not waste people's time.  I kindly excused myself wished him the best and left. 

I feel lied to and misled. I feel frustrated and unsupported by my friends who thought this situation was hilarious and made jokes that I'm an ""ice princess"".  Is this normal for dating?? I can't imagine thinking this behavior is acceptable.

Edit for Update: thank you so much for all the support. I feel good that I left early. He texted me in the middle of the night last night a bunch of profanity and calling me the c word and I just blocked and ignored him.  I am able to laugh this off more now but do still think it's important to evaluate my friendships as I was already doing this before with this particular group for other reasons. I will screen people a lot more heavily now with video/ phone calls and waiting longer to meet them. I deleted the apps  because I didn't feel comfortable and safe. After a long painful marriage and being so happy single, I'm not in a rush to disrupt that too much.

Long story short, we had been giving things another shot, but it wasn't working, and I was ready to move out right when the world went to hell.

datingoverthirty,110m300,1676225278.0,Just ended what I thought was a promising start to a relationship and I‚Äôm super bummed.,"My big fourth date went up in flames last night. I have decided to only date with intention so after two dates with this guy I asked for specificity about what he‚Äôs looking for (his profile says not sure). He said that he wasn‚Äôt opposed to a relationship but that he didn‚Äôt know how much time he could invest right now. I say that‚Äôs fine, we can give it a shot and if it doesn‚Äôt work then fine. Most of all I wanted to let him know that I wasn‚Äôt sleeping with anyone new unless there was a potential for a relationship. I went out of town for a week for a work and we texted every day. Two days after I got back we had a great third date. We made plans to go out again last night but on Friday I decided I really didn‚Äôt want to get dressed and go out so I suggested we just get pizza and hangout at my house. The plan had been for us to end up here anyway. He said that sounded good and that he also wasn‚Äôt feeling up to going out again. I let him know that I typically don‚Äôt go out super often but I was avoiding at home dates because I hadn‚Äôt been ready for sex and for me home dates lead to sex. I said that since we were going to be crossing that bridge anyway we could start doing more cozy dates. I spend the day yesterday get prepared for our ‚Äúbig night‚Äù and I was feeling so excited about it. He came in and seemed a bit awkward at first but he is like that every time we meet. Not super unusual. He meets my dog, we talk, and eat pizza. Finally I put the dishes away to initiate the rest of the planned evening. Before I can say three words, he says that he doesn‚Äôt actually want to be in a relationship and that he knows I only want to sleep with someone if that‚Äôs where it‚Äôs headed. He‚Äôs says ‚ÄúI guess this could have been a phone call.‚Äù  I‚Äôm like fuck yeah it could have been. Then it just got kinda awkward and silent then he asks if I want him to leave. I‚Äôm caught off guard so I just say no you don‚Äôt have to leave. We continued to talk for another hour or so. Finally he leaves and kisses me when he goes. 

I was genuinely shocked at how this unfolded. On Wednesday he had said that he would like to go to the symphony with me when the season starts. He then sent me some pics of his kitties. It all felt so damn cutesy. 

I woke up early this morning and texted him that I don‚Äôt think it be wise for us to stay in contact. I said that I am not looking for friends, especially one that I saw a potential relationship with. Not to mention he said he did want to sleep with me but didn‚Äôt want to give me the impression that he wanted a relationship. So in no way would that have been a healthy situation. I also told him I really didn‚Äôt appreciate him coming over to my house just to tell me that he didn‚Äôt want to be in a relationship. I reminded him that I told him on Friday that I had a hard time doing home dates without it leading to sex so he put me in an extremely difficult position. Not only did I have to strongly assert my boundary, I had to spend the next hour trying to not change my mind. I told him that I wished him luck in whatever life brings, but I‚Äôm out. 

Thought I might have actually had a date on valentines this year‚Ä¶denied. Back to the drawing board I suppose.

EDIT: Y‚Äôall I realize he could have lied and slept with me anyway and I appreciate his honesty. I told him as much. He wanted to be platonic friends and I said that if we wanted to sleep with each other, platonic is not going to work out. I wish I had met him at a different point in his life because I truly enjoy him as a person.

EDIT 2: Thanks for all the robust responses, genuinely. I went into the night under the impression that he was interested in seeing where this goes, I was mistaken. In hindsight I wish I wouldn‚Äôt have used such harsh language but I was hurt that he waited until I leaned to say that he doesn‚Äôt want a relationship. I‚Äôm only now trying to date with intention. I was a late bloomer and had a lot of casual sex for awhile. I‚Äôll get better.","It's too bad it wasn't a phone call, but getting a straight answer out of him that he's not after the same thing on a 4th date is ultimately a positive result. 

It's also good that he was honest; some guys would have just gone ahead and had sex with you and either told you after, or flaked out and left you to figure out that he wasn't willing to invest in an actual relationship. 

I guess that's just a silver lining, and I know the letdown is real for you, so that sucks. It sounds like your approach worked, though.

When I was dating, I was basically rejected at one point because I did the open communicative approach I had aspired to. It doesn't *feel* good, but I was satisfied to know that I went about it in the right way. (Turned out to be good practice, because the next woman I dated is now my wife.)"
datingoverthirty,110lnzq,1676224253.0,Girl dumps me because I am busy when I am not with her?,"I was going on 2 dates with a girl I met on tinder, things were fine, not super though as I found her a bit reserved. We had 2 Mondays so far, 1 was teahouse and 2 was exhibition and dinner. I walked her home both times, had great chats. I asked when she is free next week so we can plan something again... and she kind of ignores me. 2 days after I send her some info of my week plans, letting her know I have some free time, but I am a busy man otherwise, have lots of thing planned because she is not answering. Then she sends a breakup text like:

1. You work out a lot I am not --- I workout in a gym 4x a week and 2x I have yoga. Nobody asked her to join me at the gym, she does pilates and I would have been happy to switch to pilates just for her, or maybe she could have joined me for yoga. I thought this is a common interest. But I am not looking for a gym buddy.
2. You work on weekends and nights, I am not and will not, our worktimes differ too much --- I do work a lot I agree, but because I am not meeting her and I love my job I thought I can work a bit more, who asked her to work on weekends, and why does she not tolerate if I do this while I am not with her? I told her I am a highly flexible person (I do not work a 9-5 job) and I work in a very demanding field. I work because I want to, and with her I would balance this better of course. But until we are not serious, why would I cut off work?
3. You go to clubs and parties and I do not --- Nobody asked her to join me... I understand that if an adult is busy, and is single they need to cut things down to fit someone else into their life. The first thing would have been to drop the parties for her. I like many kinds of music, she seems to like just a few. But is this a dealbreaker? I do all kinds of things, classical concerts even. This is not a common interest, but is different music taste a deal breaker?

Literally she asked after 2 dates to free up my calendar completely for her to fit in. All while every time we went out, I was there, I never rescheduled and I made me free that day. The second date she literally picked the next Monday on Monday as she was busy most probably on other days? I told her I am flexible and I like my time to be spent with activities and interests, not alone at home doing nothing, and of course if things get more serious, gradually we both need to make effort to accommodate each other in our lives. Now it seems for her this is already a turn-off? I though if someone does not do anything in their free time, that is a turnoff... I suspect of course she is not feeling it, and wants to end and try someone else. And that is fine, I did not feel it either, but I wanted to keep going to see if there is anything. Maybe this is basic incompatibility?

Just putting this out here for comments.","You weren't dumped, it's been 2 dates.

Usually, people don't say why--and when they do, a lot of it is made up or partial truths (and you probably don't get the real reason).  Yes, fundamental differences in lifestyle mean that you are going to be incompatible with someone else.  This isn't that shocking and I'm surprised that you think it is. Most people don't want to ask someone to change their life after 2 dates, and it's totally reasonable for her to look for someone that's an easier fit into their lifestyle."

I (M35) started a new job with an international company and in our first work conference I met  Sara who just recently got divorced. 2 people getting out of bad relationships, need a distraction; what better than an international work conference fling.What started as a one night stand turned into an exchange of numbers, and eventually became travel trips to see each other.

Despite her being in the European market and I'm in the US, we each visited each other twice and had 2 other conference meetups prior to this one from last week. After our initial hookup, texts grew from 2-3 weekly flirty texts to almost daily video call. Needless to say, this is we started becoming emotionally attached to each other and somehow became a long-distance couple. At the start, we knew our lives wouldn't allow us be anything more than long-distance FWB. 

I briefly mentioned that I got back from a work trip and our relationship completely changed. Day 1 of the conference, we arrived early and decided to begin the adult activities prior to everyone else's arrival.  Sara wanted to go out afterwards and meet the co-workers for a nightly shenanigan. I'm a low-key kind of guy, I prefer smaller intimate moments over wild party nights, she knows this. I don't like being around crowds or big groups. When the average age of my colleagues is 25/26, this is what most of them want to do. As a single mom, she looks forward to these work festivities, naturally she wanted to hang out and shut down the bar with these folks while I'm usually in bed by 11pm (we had 8am workshops to attend each day). It would be a daily routine of her inviting me out (mind you, our coworkers aren't to know of our fling)and me offering alternative activity to the drinking. Days would end with me offering her to come by my room when she would return but I'd hear nothing until the next morning. 

Now the 4th night, we'd finally have our 1on1 time and it's because I managed to stay out drinking and we happened to arrive at the hotel at the same time. While I thought I was finally going to get sexy time, I walked into the most awkward & drunken ""what are we conversation"". I walk into a rant about how we're kidding ourselves, we need to be honest on what this is, she always feels guilty when she talks to a guy because of me, we can't be exclusive (we never said we were). No sexy time and 2 hour discussion on how we were to proceed. Essentially we were just going to be friends and if opportunities come up, we'll spring on them.

While we left that hotel in decent terms, I knew that everything had changed. I thought we would just go no contact or we would just fall back into the old routine. Nope. This whole week, it's been a slow drifting apart. Before, there would be at most 30minutes between our texts, and now I'm lucky if she answers the same day. But what got me was the texts I got yesterday. We are about 8 hours apart and she text me at 1pm my time to check in and say hello and send me a pic of her before going out with her friends. This is nothing new, until I saw what she was wearing. Typically, Sara would dress rather conservatively (not much make-up, long and loose flowing dresses, or knitted skirts that would reach the shins). In the photo, she was wearing an outfit  she typically wears with me. She has these really tight jeans that accentuate her legs and ass, tight fitting shirt that barely covers her navel, and red lipstick. I have quite a few memories of this woman and our sexiest and passionate nights occurred when dressed in this manner. I dunno if it's intentional or subconsciously but when dressed like that, she intends to end the evening with a no-pants dance. When 8pm my time rolled around, no call or text (where she would normally drunkenly send I miss you texts, give me a recap of the night, or awkward video sex). 

I did not hear back from her until 3pm today and she just dropped off the kids and heading out to see a ""friend"". This was accompanied again with a selfie with her wearing lipstick in a slightly revealing blouse. Of the hundreds of selfies she has sent of her going out, she has never worn red lipstick. Now she's popping that thing on, in back to back night outs which she has never done in the past. She has also never used the phrase ""friend"" with me.  Whether it's 1 person or a group, they're are always referred to by name. Maybe it's paranoia and I'm reading too into this, but I don't think so. I'm so OCD, I pick up other people's patterns and I've had enough interactions with Sara to pick up some of her behaviors. I've never had an issue walking away from whatever situation I'm in (dating, relationship, FWB, etc) I don't understand why this bothers me so much, I feel jealous and I don't get jealous. I can't even get myself to move-on because I keep thinking about her. It just really fucking sucks and it fucking hurts. 

It's not like I can be with her, there are no transferrable roles for me. I also can't pack up and move my life to Europe for a relationship that just may not work. We are both on the rebound, this was supposed to be fun and flirty and yet I feel like I'm trying to walk away from a 5 year relationship. 2020 & 2021 were hellish years for me and last year was spent me getting my shit together, but I feel like I just took 1000 paces back. The analytical side of me is telling me this is the out I'm looking for, the emotional part of me wants to stay connected some way. 

I hate this emotional turmoil and I kinda wish I never exchanged numbers with this girl. FWB with growing connections are dangerous and should end the instant you start catching feelings and know it can't work. As much as I'm given the opportunity to limit the hurt and end it, but I can't help but think about how I felt when I was with this woman.  I can't get myself to commit to walking out of her life. For all those times, I would say reddit users need to learn to walk away.... I get it it now. 

I swear my love life is nothing but dating and flings that go nowhere.

Update:
I figured it would be easier to just do a mass update instead of repeating myself. I apologize for the not-so-sober original post.

1. I severed ties with her. Short message, told her I enjoyed the time we had together but it's best we go out separate ways... Then blocked her, and moved on.

2. I understand how FWB works, I knew the risks, and I'm upset that I found myself catching feelings and didn't end it. For some odd reason, I thought our job situation and distance would be enough of a deterrent to keep us from falling for each other.

3. Given that I'm now sober, I wasn't necessarily jealous. I was more annoyed that she decided to send the selfies when she pulling back on communication. To have the ""what are we"" talk, and then 6 days later share selfie pics as if we are back to normal when we are not. There was no point to send the selfies. 

4. This bothers me more than it should. In a fwb, there is no obligation to truly hang out. This notion that she wanted me to hang out and spend time with her is false. I mentioned to another person, that hanging out with these colleagues is the same thing every time. It's a pub or karaoke bar, someone gets lost, someone gets kicked in a bathroom, half the group gets so shit faced that they function like toddlers. It's not like she and I would've been seen together, it would be me in forced conversation about myself and USA (whatever the big news is) and she'd be on the opposite side of the room. Not staying out til 3-4am isn't my thing anymore and she knows that. Makes no sense for this to be an issue. However, when we would take trips to see each other, we did hang out and engage in activities.

While I am confident in my sex game, I'm not delusional to believe that it was the only reason why she came to visit. I'm good but I'm not $1200-1800 for multiple flights good. We had great sexual capability, but I also enjoyed our conversations. But in the end, I take blame in my part in this and it is time to go back and focus on me.",OP is living a fantasy.

I thought I found my person and admittedly got too invested too fast. We talked about our feelings early on and he claimed it was mutual. Since it was apparently out of character for both of us we decided to keep seeing eachother and keep talking and were both pretty excited to see where things went. He was still friends with his ex which I thought was mature as I'm still friends with a few of mine. 

Record scratch. He lied. A lot. 

Last night I bled during sex and he freaked out, calling me ""gross"", so we got into a huge fight. I just went back on birth control since he ""can't wear condoms due to ED"" and have been having a really hard time with it. I'm spotting and bleeding and cramping at random. My acne is really bad and making me self conscious. I can't control it and don't see it comming. I feel like if I was being this supportive around his ED the least he could do is tactfully put a towel down instead of yelling ""GROSS! OMG WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG?"" and hiding in the bathroom. He claims that he can't control his reactions and ""needs space to fuck up sometimes"". Take it. All the space you want. The fuck away from me. 

I don't know why he told me but he then that he moved in with his most recent ex a month into dating. He usually commits early and I'm not special. It came off almost. . .punitive? It was hurtful. 

Something was fishy about this ex. A ha! He also let me know that he did not in fact break up with this ex three years ago as he initally told me. She moved out and they stopped having sex due to his ED a few years ago, and he can't remember if it was only a year ago or maybe five. 
But he continued to go to her family functions as her date, buy her dinner once a week or so, and storing her stuff at ""their"" apartment until a month or so ago. Apparently he stopped hanging out with her as she was upset he was seeing me. No shit sherlock, you have her the impression that you were still dating. His solution here was to let me know that she had asked to move back in recently. Again, why are you telling me this? 

Overall it seems like I got used as a rebound and was discarded when my body made me a real human. I'm gutted because I booked a bunch of non refundable valentine's stuff for us. I'm not working right now and was able to save up my pennies from my disability insurance, but it was a sacrifice. Now I'm out the cash and he hasn't offered to even pay back his half. 

Bed. I will be in bed today."
datingoverthirty,10yus7g,1676042882.0,"Wanting children, but only with a good connection. 35 year old woman feeling like I am running out of time.","Hi all,

I feel extreme sadness nowadays. 
I have always known I want children and a good partner to grow old with. I have a good job, amazing friends that fulfil me emotionally and am running my first half marathon as well as learning guitar. But I struggle with meaning in my life. I have gone to therapy to resolve my families impact on my psyche. Many people look to me for advice and I tend to be non judgemental knowing that we all suffer. 

But I also wish for an emotionally available partner who puts the relationship on a good foundation with me. I spoke to 200 guys on the phone and met about 50 in the last three years. Recently I met guys that I did click with but no chemistry, Three times I met guys that where a match two of them turned out to not like me back the same way and where emotionally unavailable for a good two sided relationship. One guy adored me but was focusing on career being both a professor and a startup founder and had no time. We still speak and I understand. I can‚Äôt deny that I feel a certain amount of frustration being in a dating pool where one half feels pressure because of their biology and the other half still has time to either figure their issues out or focus on work. It leaves me feeling very uncertain how to proceed. For three years I focused on dating with no results and I can‚Äôt continue living like this. It feels like I am stuck, but at the same time I don‚Äôt trust that the right guy will just fall into my lap. 

I am scared I never was focused on my career and have always put relationships first, as I know their contribution to happiness I am not ashamed of being this way. I also believe the city I am living in might not be conducive for me to find what I am looking for as it‚Äôs very high achieving and everyone looks like a super model. I look good am doing well but certainly not supermodel. Plus the city is quite conservative and I am more open minded, but still conservative in my relationship outlook. I feel like so could do better in another pond but also have amazing friends here. Though I don‚Äôt want to rely on that as they might move at some point. My home city feels a bit small to me now as in it served an old persona of myself not who I am now.


My questions are the following:
1. I feel like I want to secure myself in a way that enables me to have a kid alone worst case. Which would mean moving back home. At 35 I might have another shot in another city before. What would you do?
2. What are you considering when making the choice of whether and when to have a kid alone?
3. Would you risk moving to a new city if you would experience dating in such a bad way?

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-
Edit 1: 
I feel I have to clarify since it came up multiple times:
1. If I don‚Äôt feel chemistry but other things where good I went on multiple dates. If it feels like I am kissing a sibling I don‚Äôt continue.
2. Conservative: ENM has become very prevalent in my age group. I don‚Äôt do that. 
3. 200 people and phone call. Originally I went on random dates soon after matching, it wasted a lot of my energy. Calls are not interviews they are cocktail party conversations and I am pretty decent at making people comfortable during the call even if they are shy. Most people have no issues with the call itself and are actually grateful I asked.


Edit 2: Wow, I have to say one thing. Regardless of the situation the replies here made me feel so much less alone in this. I wish for all of you wonderful people to find what you look for. Thank you so much for all the thoughtful comments!","How are there so many of us in a generation that have wanted to be parents our whole lives but can't manage to find a partner worth making the commitment with? It blows my mind. I grew up thinking, ""of course I'll find someone, duh!"" To now being 36, single, and no kids despite being successful in all the other ways. 

I wouldn't pursue single parenthood, myself. My plan is to move to a new city, meet new people, and go from there. I hope you find what you're looking for üòä."

datingoverthirty,10ycjjj,1675992585.0,Give me some hope! Single going on 9 years,"Feeling a little low. I don't know if I need advice, plain reassurance, or words of wisdom perhaps, but at my age (late 30s F) I still haven't got it figured out. I've been single since 2014 and haven't made so much as attempt to date until pretty recently; essentially I raised my one child to adulthood and worked on finding basic contentedness in life. I'm actually pretty happy overall: I've been working in a job I generally enjoy which energizes me, I'm physically healthier than I've been in a long time, my family is doing well, etc.


But I'm lonely as fuck! I don't have a huge social need- I exist rather happily without friends as I'm a loner introvert and get just enough social interaction with work buddies. But romantically, sexually, there's this emptiness in my life I very much would like to fill. And not just for the sake of doing so (as in, to avoid loneliness). I so miss having that person to bounce ideas, jokes, anything, off of everyday. I so miss physical contact in all forms. I miss having that *connection* with someone who ""gets it.""


The thing is, I don't know that I trust myself enough even after so many years of building up to a place where I'm generally secure and happy with who I am. I don't trust my ability to choose a secure partner, as my previous relationships (a decade or more ago) were fraught with issues. More often than not, the men I was attracted to/attracted/ partnered with were the ""avoidant"" type if you follow attachment theory. Lots of hot/cold, inconsistencies, instability. All I want now is the exact opposite! But I'm still noticing a similar pattern when I meet men IRL recently: meet decent guy, notice that he appears interested/attracted to me, get to know him, become attracted/ return interest by escalating my attention/flirting, at which time he'll back off. 


Which leaves me feeling like a) they weren't interested to begin with and I suck at picking up signals, or b) they're the exact avoidant /unavailable types I very much am trying to, well, avoid. I'm a bit despondent and feeling like I have no idea what the hell I'm even doing or why I'm bothering as being single hasn't been horrible. I just...want to love someone and be loved, in a romantic sense, you know?

I'm sure it doesn't help matters that I've been out of practice for so long. I'm reluctantly considering OLD but not eager about it. I really can't gauge attraction based on photos, and the newer dating apps really seem to limit how much you write, and honestly the fucking ""prompts"" demanding a witty concise sentence stress me out. So we'll see. 

I don't know, I'm sure most of us are here on DO30 because we're still trying to work this shit out, but hey, if anyone has any suggestions, thoughts, pointers on recognizing secure, consistent men, whatever, I'm all for it.","Oftentimes if you‚Äôre attracted to avoidant types, you might be an anxious type. I‚Äôve done a lot of work with a therapist and self-help/journaling. Here are my takeaways:

1.) Being an anxious type is rooted in fear of abandonment and low self-esteem. These avoidant men confirm your fears and leave you feeling insecure, which subconsciously comforts your brain because it‚Äôs the pattern you‚Äôre used to. Old habits die hard. This [poem](https://www.mindfulnesstherapy.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/autobiography-in-five-chapters-portia-nelson.pdf) explains it quite well. It sounds like you might be between step three and four.

2.) Understanding the problem is first. It sounds like you‚Äôre pretty much there. I read *Attached* for this part. 

3.) Next, you need to heal the wound within yourself. This generally takes years of solitude and finding yourself. Loving yourself. Therapy. I think you have done that too, but be honest and do the work if you still need to. 

4.) Then, before you get back into dating, you need to make a list of what you want in a secure, healthy relationship. List your needs. Your dealbreakers. Your goals. Reading [this book](https://www.amazon.com/Dr-Seths-Love-Prescription-Relationship/dp/1440503699) really helped me on this step. It‚Äôs not perfect, but it was useful. 

5.) Take it slow when you start dating someone. Be objective. Ensure they meet your needs. Don‚Äôt overlook dealbreakers or red flags. Don‚Äôt stay thinking they‚Äôll change. Don‚Äôt try to fix them just because there‚Äôs a spark or chemistry. Trust your gut. 

6.) Stick to your guns and speak up for your needs. Communicate clearly and honestly. This is where we often become codependent, sacrificing our needs out of fear that speaking up will be taken as a ‚Äúdemand‚Äù or ultimatum (see my recent thread for an example of this). Compromise is okay as long as you‚Äôre honestly happy and you feel your needs are met. And yes, you should absolutely want to meet the needs of your partner, as long as you‚Äôre not sacrificing your own. This is where, if you can‚Äôt meet each others‚Äô needs, you admit that you‚Äôre not compatible and walk away before either of you is hurt too deeply. Even if you really like them. 

7.) Always remember that rejection, incompatibility, falling for an avoidant, getting cheated on, being manipulated or used, abused, or otherwise treated poorly‚Ä¶ remember NONE of that is about you. It either means you simply weren‚Äôt right for each other (in the case of rejection or incompatibility), or they had issues they need to work through before they can be a good partner. They likely have or will treat others just as poorly. It‚Äôs not a reflection of your worth or what you deserve. 

As for how to meet someone? If you have hobbies, you can join groups to meet people. Check out Facebook activity groups too. Or just talk to people out in the world and see what happens. Be friendly. Be proactive. Ask for numbers or to meet for coffee. Don‚Äôt be afraid of rejection. 

Don‚Äôt be afraid of online dating either. It‚Äôs a whole new set of challenges, but once you learn not to sweat the small stuff and not to get attached too quickly, it can be a lot of fun. 

There will be guys who flake. Cancel last minute. Ghost you. Maybe stand you up. Use you for sex. There‚Äôs rejection. It can hurt, but don‚Äôt give up. There will be awkward dates. Bad dates. Rude dates. Liars. 

But there will also be fun dates. Adventure. New places. Cool conversations. Flirting. Sweet kisses. Butterflies. Great sex. Short flings. Romance. Love. 

There will be guys you reject. Try and do so with kindness. 

Then hopefully one day you‚Äôll find something easy, good, and safe. It might feel boring at first, when you‚Äôre used to the hot/cold rollercoaster of avoidants. But stick with it, build on it, communicate, have fun, and it will finally happen. A healthy, secure, lasting love. 

It‚Äôs not easy when you‚Äôre a single mom in your late 30s, but it can and does happen. Be patient and try to enjoy the process. 

It took me about a year to work through all of that. I fell for an avoidant last year because I rushed things. I thought I had asked all the right questions and gotten to know him well enough, but because we saw each other practically every day, I fell too quickly. His avoidant behavior and other red flags (narcissist) didn‚Äôt come out until I was already attached. I wasn‚Äôt strong enough to walk away (so in that poem, I was a three). I let him hurt me repeatedly. 

Then in December, I started dating someone new. He had a couple red flags early on, and he triggered my anxious response system. I took things slow though, so once it became clear my needs weren‚Äôt met, I was able to walk away after six weeks without issue (step four from the poem).  

I hope now I‚Äôm on step five. I used a different app (OkCupid). It‚Äôs older and not as popular as the others, but there‚Äôs SO much room to write about yourself, and there are hundreds of personality questions that give you a compatibility percentage with your potential matches. You can swipe left or right based just on pictures, but I don‚Äôt. I read their full profile and only match with people if they‚Äôre 90% or above and have similar dating goals. I tend to keep the conversation to a minimum in the app and suggest we meet for coffee within a day or two. I‚Äôm really hopeful this will lead to a better outcome. I had a second date today that went really well, so fingers crossed!

I hope some of this can help you too. :-)"
datingoverthirty,10y2qhc,1675968785.0,Should I reach out to either party?,"I (32F) went on two dates with a guy (34M) late last year. He was nice enough, but I wasn't feeling it and directly communicated this to him. He seemed a little crushed but took it in stride. We've had no communication since. Earlier this week out of the blue he reached out saying that he has a mutual friend that he thinks I'd be a good fit for and shared his picture and LinkedIn info. Given my minimal success on the apps, I told him I would be open to connecting with this person. I made the (apparently wrong) assumption he had spoken to his friend first before contacting me, which seems like the natural order of things. This guy said he'd touch base with his friend and get back to me.

This is complicated by the fact that I've matched with the potential set-up guy on Bumble in the past month and sent him a message but he did not respond. (I asked about recs for other afrofuturism books as he lists a lot of my favorite sci fi authors who write in that genre. So much for a thoughtful first message...). I saw that the potential set-up guy viewed my LinkedIn page twice but I haven't heard from either party. I realize my LinkedIn is a good portrait of me professionally, but doesn't really give insight into who I am as a person, why I would be a good person to date, etc. 

My inclination is to preserve my pride, move on and assume the set-up guy is not interested and save myself further embarrassment/rejection. However, given that I am trying to meet people off the apps and push myself to be open to connections, there is a small piece of me that wants to reach out. 

My questions are: 1) should I reach out the the mutual friend and ask what happened/closure on the situation? 2) Should I reach out via LinkedIn to this guy?","I would leave it alone. The guy didn‚Äôt bite on bumble, he‚Äôs looked at your LinkedIn, if he was interested you would know by now. Also sometimes we don‚Äôt tell our friends when we start dating someone new. This guy could be talking to someone and your mutual person didn‚Äôt know and shouldn‚Äôt have offered him up."

datingoverthirty,10x0mvn,1675870384.0,"Has a promising first week with a guy, and then nothing....","UPDATE at bottom

&#x200B;

I am not very active on OLD, just check my profile on occasion. About 2 weeks ago I got a message from a guy. He was very straight forward, just messaged me: ""Hey, do you want to go grab a drink on Friday? I don't do the talking on apps for 3 weeks lol"". I said yes, we had a tiny bit of small talk on the app, decided on a time and place. A week goes by, no messaging, day before he confirms that we're still good, and we go on the meet up.

It went well, he is very attractive, conversation was good. Some background - he is a manager at a restaurant so we only met up much later in the evening after his shift was over. I realized then that with his job, meeting up can be a bit difficult, but that's fine with me.

I give him my number the next day, and he asks me out for lunch during the week. I tell him that because I have a normal office job with normal office hours, meeting for lunch can be hard for me. He then suggest we meet up next Friday at my favorite bar which he hasn't been to yet but would love to go check out, and I agree.

Later that day I messaged him and tell him that there is a small bistro next to my office where we can meet for lunch but because of my short lunch break, that's the only possible place for me to have lunch. He agrees and we see each other the Wednesday. It goes well.

During the Wednesday lunch date he asks if I'm still up for Friday. I am, and then he suggest that I stop by his restaurant for a glass of prosecco before we go off to the bar. I show up on Friday evening just before his shift ends, and he introduces me to his boss and all his co-workers. He gets me a glass of prosecco and then I wait alone at the restaurant bar while he finishes off his work. It took about 20 minutes, I finish my drink. He then gets us a table and orders himself a drink and I get a 2nd one. All is still good.

We head off the the bar, I have slightly too much wine, we have our first kiss while a live band was playing. He asks me to join him for brunch the next morning and I happily say yes. Later I realized that I am getting a bit drunk so I tell him that I want to go home. This was about 4 hours after we met up that evening. He asks me if I have wine at home so we can have another drink at my place, but I said no. I only met this guy a week ago and I wasn't ready to invite him over to my place just yet.

When I got home I messaged him that I'm home safe, thanked him for the evening and tells him good night. No response. I'm pretty sure I was home before him because I live much closer to the bar than he does. The next morning he messaged me to confirm brunch plans. Brunch was good, but I could only stay about 2 hours because I had some things to do. When we said goodbye I was ready to give him a kiss but he gave me an awkward hug.

Didn't hear from him the rest of the day but he was working so that's fine. Sunday evening I message him after he was done with work, we have some chit chat over whatsapp, and then he stops replying. The next morning he messaged me ""Sorry I fell asleep, have a good day"". I reply wishing him a good day too. Haven't heard from him since. I initiated the last text conversation and sent the last text, so I was kinda waiting for him to send the next message but it's just complete silence from his side.

It's been 3 days. Should I message him again? I don't want to seem desperate. I really did like this guy and I'm wondering if I did something to put him off?

Edit: UPDATE: So I messaged him. Just a short and to the point ""Hey, how's it going? Would you like to go out again?"" He read the message shortly after, but took hours to respond. (He was online several times before responding and I know he was not working in that time). He replied something along the lines of (I'm translating here, English is not my first language) that I seemed bored and uninterested during our brunch date. I apologized to him if I came across that way, assured him that that is not how I was feeling at all, I was just a bit hungover. 

I asked him again if he would like to meet up again, and he just did not reply. So I blocked and deleted his number the next day. Some people have pointed out that I might not have seemed interested enough in him. I think I showed enough interest, I payed for myself during the 2 of the dates, offered to pay for the other 2 (he paid for lunch and brunch but my part of the bill was only around $5 each time). I initiated the hugs, complimented him and flirted with him, suggested places to go and things to do on future dates, etc. 

I think, like many have suggested, that his interest shifted after I didn't let him come home with me. That he felt rejected and that's why he was acting awkward during brunch. At the time I just thought he was a bit hungover too. Time to move on",">He asks me if I have wine at home so we can have another drink at my place, but I said no. I only met this guy a week ago and I wasn't ready to invite him over to my place just yet.

When he first proposed the brunch idea he was probably envisioning it as the continuation/conclusion of the current date, but then the night came to an end. That's probably when his interest shifted, and he followed through with the brunch because it was already agreed upon."

Some of the commenters to that post stated that they feel a little lost when they don't have a partner. I was hoping we could help provide them a bit of guidance.

I (37) am an only child and have been single most of my life so I'm accustomed to being by myself. My hobbies include photography, biking, the gym, movies, books/audiobooks, museums, attending local happenings, with the occasional road trip somewheres. I do volunteer work taking photos at a weekly event during the Spring and Summer where all the profits raised from said event are donated to two local charities. This year I'm looking to branch out to additional kinds of volunteer work for more variety, learn new skills, and continue to meet new people. There's a few other things, but I don't want to be one of those that says ""I'm going to do X!"" without actually starting it first.

Our dates are basically going to restaurants. At the very beginning of dating, I suggested some indoor activities like bowling, shuffleboard bar, etc., because I didn‚Äôt want him to come up with all the ideas (until then, he was booking restaurants to go to). 

And when we started dating somewhat more seriously after sleeping together, he told me it was stressful for him to make those reservations, especially picking the places. So I told him it was not a big deal, I can take over. 

Since then, I‚Äôve been planning our dinner dates. I ask him if there‚Äôs anything he‚Äôd like to do, and he says what I had suggested in the past.

Sure we can have dinner dates on Fridays, sleep over at each other‚Äôs, have sex, get breakfast together, and repeat it. Until what? This is getting boring for me.

Her response was that she wasn‚Äôt feeling the vibe. She also mentioned she didn‚Äôt think I was that interested. I‚Äôm hind sight I should have asked her out again sooner, that said I suppose I wasn‚Äôt totally feeling it. Thanks all for the feedback!***

Met someone OLD about a month ago right before leaving for a 3 week trip. We didn‚Äôt have time to meet before I left because she had her kids the weekend before I left so we planned on meeting when I got back. 

She stayed in almost daily contact with me and I got to know her a bit. I reciprocated messaging and initiated some conversations but for the most part she was first to wish me a good day, ask about plans and see how things were going. Sent a few pictures back and forth and there was some flirty banter as well. We had dinner planned for when we got back.  

Fast forward to dinner after I‚Äôm back, things went great I thought. Conversation was smooth and flowed and we both seemed to have a good time. 

Next day nothing. No text. That‚Äôs fine. She had a lot going on a work I knew about the next day. Maybe it‚Äôs that. I text her later the following evening, ‚ÄúIt was nice to see you yesterday‚Äù. She responded, ‚Äúit was nice talking with you too‚Äù. Next day nothing, I shoot her a text that evening about a band coming to town and she replies excitedly. 

That was this last Wednesday. She has her kids since Wednesday but she had her kids when we messaged each other while I was away. So at this point I‚Äôm assuming she‚Äôs not interested and is going to try and let things just fizzle out. 

It‚Äôs a different situation for me because I‚Äôve never had someone as attached from the get go without ever meeting and we spent close to a month really getting to know each other. It‚Äôs not like my picture are not accurate and I look super different, if anything that was the case for her (most of her pics use weird camera angle to hide certain things). I get that there might just not be a connection and that‚Äôs certainly no one‚Äôs fault but I‚Äôm very much confused by a lot of this.

Matched with a guy on Tinder and we started messaging off the app.  I find him really cool and articulate.  It's been over 6 weeks and he has never shown interest in asking me out, to facetime, or generally to do anything but message.  We exchange texts every few days. In his pictures he looked very attractive but I guess he doesn't see me like that.  I'm scared to broach the subject because maybe it's better to just have someone to message?  I also am lonely and  having a friend to keep in touch with is nice.  Then again, if we are just friends it might be nice to at least do activities together.  Thoughts?","Just ask him out.

I'm emotionally available but just worried that my comfort level with my life is too comfortable, I come and go as I please, do what I like but guess I worry from past experiences that would all change too much.

datingoverthirty,10uyf30,1675660513.0,Am I just not a match for the typical dating scene?,"While I(33m) understand that it is important to cultivate that ""close/ romantic feelings"" especially on the first date. I tend to focus on trying to get to know the person on the first date to see if it feels like I could vibe with them. My dates usually end with them seeing me as a friend which I don't mind. However, I do notice that having spent a lot of time in San Francisco to see if the other person feels that our values are aligned.

Something about the process to get really close/ have fun/ be romantic so quickly feels weird on a first date. It feels that leads to a lot of people letting go of some of their ""standards"" in the short term b/c they've enjoyed the company, but when 3-6 months come around ""their messy room is no longer just a cute quirk"". 

I'm not give up on dating, but maybe I should just stick to socializing and trying to make friends. I have found that most of my romantic interest have come around after they have laid the boundary of being friends and they sudden shift gears to want to start dating. 

Anyone got thoughts? Is the only thing to with OLD is to try to cultivate that fun easy going vibe even I'm not even sure if I want to spent time more time with them just so that they may feel more ""romantic feelings""?



EDIT: turns out I might have Demiromanticism. That's fun to know I guess and probably OLD will never really work for me. However it does seem so strange to me how people can just ""trust"" their romantic feelings enough even if they barely know anything about the person.",[deleted]

She texted me back.
She apologized for ghosting me, when she gets stressed she introverts, said she enjoyed our date but said she doesn't feel like she can get in a serious relationship because she is recovering from a recent bad 4 year breakup.

I responded with I totally get that and if she wanted to take things really slow as friends I'd be cool with that, but if she just felt I wasn't a good fit/or she truly wanted to be alone then I would be okay with that.

She said she actually wanted to go on more dates but is focused on living situation, figuring a career, and she is still healing because the last guy was well abusive.

I said I totally get it, I'll continue to date other peolle and we can just be friends right now no pressure see where that goes but offered us to get off the app so if we are gonna start this friendship thing at a minimum for now we can text or if not we can stay on the app, just whatever she is comfortable with.... And she texted (phone number finally) me telling me thank you for being understanding.

So at this moment I think this might be genuinely a person just not ready to date/healing....not someone who didn't feel a sprk etc, cause I gave her MULTIPLE outs to just say it and let us go separate. IDK

datingoverthirty,10uqja5,1675638504.0,Are exes taking people's pets a thing now?!,"Greetings, DOT.
I'm chatting with someone on Hinge and we're talking about my dog. I ask if he has any pets and he tells me he used to have a cat and his ex took it. I ask for more information and he said they split the price of the cat and she took it without him knowing....? Then he said ""Yeah. That was fun"". 

My most recent ex used to wistfully mention how much he missed his dog when he played with mine. He said his ex took his dog when he wasn't home (they lived together). It was his dog - he got it before he met the ex. I asked him more than once how in God's name he could just let someone take his dog and not follow up or anything?!  He would just shrug and say he knew the dog was well taken care of and wouldn't offer any more on the subject. 

So my question is.....is this a thing now?! Someone taking my dog is unfathomable to me. I'm also concerned that new guy is already bringing up his ex unfavorably in the early stages of chatting. Thank you in advance for your advice and insights!

EDIT: Thank you all for responding. To be clear, he brought up the ex unnecessarily when I asked if he had pets. He could have said ""no"" or ""I had a cat"" or even ""I had a cat but it belongs to my ex now"". The fact that he brought up the ex AND commented negatively on her, even though what she did was obviously shitty, was my concern here (along with my concern over petnapping!) Plus we're only getting his side of the story so who knows what all really occurred. 
I've also known plenty of couples who do split custody of a pet so to me that's healthier and less odd than someone stealing someone's pet in the night. I do appreciate everyone's perspectives, however.

EDIT: Gonna have dinner, take my dog for a walk (the dog I would never let anyone else steal ü§£), and wind down here. Will try to check in but have a busy week at work ahead. Thank you again for your responses.","Not a red flag. You asked.

datingoverthirty,10tyv9q,1675564985.0,Giving time or cutting it off is better?,"Edit - I reeddited some of the words in this post. The title is poorly worded. The whole point was if I should have ended it earlier or I should have given it time like I did in this case. 




The guy (35M)I was seeing for 8 months broke it off with me, I (38F) had been away for two months on a medical situation and we did long distance from another country for two months. Long distance with him was extremely challenging as he doesn't text, chat or do video calls, God alone knows how can I stay in touch. He has always been a bad communicator. I kept insisting we jump on a call to connect and at one point and also mentioned had I been in California we would have met once a week and that would have helped. This was the only way to keep the momentum going! I complained to him how frustrated I was that he isn't putting any effort into initiating the video calls, his reply was that he is checking his phone often to reply to me and that he usually doesn't message anyone but he is doing it for me; I thanked him and appreciated the effort he is putting in on messages but this concern is about video calls. He totally ignored my concern, this was kinda my only ""I am frustrated"" text I sent him. 

On Monday I just came back from a month long medical treatment, 2 months away from each other, a 23 hr plane journey and severely jetlagged and we met that evening (on hindsight I shouldn't have met on the same day, idk). It was amazing to be reconnected, I cooked, we watched movies, he had got me a Christmas gift (I wasn't here for Christmas). While we were in bed and I threw him the question about how he feels about me and he replied with ""I like you and I enjoy hanging out with you"" I was disappointed that he is still saying only these line after being together for 8 months. We ended up having a serious talk and he said how he  isn't feeling very strongly and that he takes time to develop feelings which seemed fair. Then he made a weird statement about how he enjoys time with his friends more than he does with me, which really hurt me which later he said he said ""poorly phrased it"". In the end he asked me ""do you want to end things?"", I was a bit shocked when he asked that and I replied that if there is major incompatibility we shouldn't continue, but if there are things that can be worked around we should. When I asked him the question back -if he wanted to end things, he said ""he doesn't know"" leaving me feeling terrible.

While we were exchanging grievances, I mentioned how I want emotional connection and it's lacking from him, he has told me a few times now how he isn't an emotional person, I think I didn't translate this as ""emotionally unavailable"". I also told him I am at a point where I want a relationship to go towards marriage but obviously with the right guy and I don't want to settle. Idk if the word marriage freaked him out. On the same note he replied he doesn't have such pressure  (which btw I already clarified before I even started this relationship, he was also looking for a LTR). After all this he said let's think about this and meet over the weekend, he hugged me tightly and asked if he could kiss me; I was just very confused about how much stuff happened in such a short span of time. I had one of those lame ass kiss and he left. He also made a comment about how next week we might grow stronger after giving enough thought. I wasn't expecting this at all on the day I came back after being apart for 2 months.

Today, we met for lunch and he told me how he doesn't see us being a long term thing and he doesn't want to string me along. He told me he doesn't see us together in a few years and I wonder if this had something to do with me bringing the ""marriage"" topic. I thanked him for being honest, he suggested we be friends and I said no. I was hurt sitting there feeling a void in my heart. I did like him a lot! Tbh I went with the mindset that let's do some exercise together to see if we speak different love languages and that might help understand each other a bit and was going to work on this.

As I reflect - He is emotionally unavailable, which drove me crazy, I was extremely drained chasing him for attention and I like emotional support. In the long run he would have left me feeling very lonely in the relationship. He wouldn't put any effort into planning our dates, which he admitted today is a flaw in his personality as he just ""goes with the flow"", this was when I clarified how I have picked most of our date activities while he hasn't done much, this was a response to his comment on how he enjoys time more with his friends than me. He wouldn't text me for days and I was left very disconnected with him, when we met it was all nice, but when we were away he was very distant. I felt a lot of the time I was carrying the relationship and it was overwhelming. Emotionally I felt I could never get past the superficial level - he enjoyed discussing dnd strategies, game theory , psychology and other stuff more than his feelings. 

You might wonder why I stuck around - when I asked him if he had feelings for me, he said yes. He has never once cancelled a date he agreed to meet, he has always shown up. He told me how he never spends time with people he doesn't like and the fact that he is showing up says he likes me. He is a decent guy, very respectful, more of a gentleman and we connected a lot intellectually and we are kinda nerds. I thought of ending it with him multiple times and I kept giving him time since he was actually a nice guy and was hoping things will change. Idk if I would have felt better if I had actually gone with breaking it off with him due to his poor communication and low effort. I spoke to multiple people and they all just told me to give it some time and not to rush into breaking it off with him since he is an otherwise nice guy.

I absolutely have no intentions of reconnecting with him. When he suggested we stay friends, I rejected that idea saying that's not how I function. I need to continue working on my relationship goals and I don't want to be ""friends"".I told him I need to take care of myself and my wants. I think people should just stop using that term.

Idk what's the whole point of this post, but I am just floating in a myriad of emotions and very hurt and sad. This is both our first LTR, if it matters. My anxious nature and his distant self really didn't do a good job, I was working on regulating my emotions but to be honest I wasn't asking more from him. I wasn't needy or clingy, I gave him enough time apart. I just don't know how this all came to and end so quickly. I also don't know what I could have done better or if he is just a wrong match for me.",I don't really understand the question here. He broke up with you. He told you he doesn't see anything long term with you. What would you give more time for? The best thing a partner can give us is the certainty that they want to be with us. You deserve someone who knows they want to be with you. He already knows he doesn't want you long term. Don't wait for him. Move on and find someone better.
datingoverthirty,10tgz5o,1675519017.0,How do you know if you truly want a relationship?,"How can you tell when you are genuinely ready and that you‚Äôre not just chasing status or escaping loneliness? I‚Äôve been single for a few years now and I‚Äôve grown quite content despite realizing that my life would be objectively more fulfilling with the right partner. 

The truth is, I no longer enjoy dating and I‚Äôm not motivated to continue trying. Occasionally, I get optimistic about getting back on the apps, but then I remind myself that I‚Äôm just craving companionship or sex in those moments and that it will fade because I prefer solitude and privacy.

I don‚Äôt know if I truly want a commitment anymore, mainly because I invested too much energy into the wrong people in the past. What I know is I don‚Äôt want to use anyone and I myself don‚Äôt want to be used. 

I don‚Äôt want surface-level connections either, but I also don‚Äôt have the time or the energy to get to know every stranger on a deep level. I‚Äôm not into casual hookups or LDRs. I do still believe in love and romance but I seem to be losing all interest in meeting new people. 

So my question is, should I give up on the idea altogether and focus on fulfillment in other areas of life? Or should I act on the instincts next time I get the urge and just go for it without expectations? 

Basically, I can‚Äôt tell if I‚Äôm being reasonable or if I‚Äôm purposely depriving myself of love. How do I even know if I need this anymore? I‚Äôd be interested to hear from other introverts in their late 30‚Äôs and older.

Edit: Thank you everyone for taking the time to respond. Lots of interesting insights so far. I‚Äôm about to make some tea and read the rest of your comments. Hope everyone is having a nice weekend!","I mean, one of the goal of being in a relationship is not to be lonely. But when it's the ONLY reason for you, you may choose someone from the place of fear, not the place of love.

But when you build a wall around yourself, pretending you do not need love, kisses, hugs, deep connections, conversations, sex, holding hands, etc - it's also a place of fear. Fear of getting hurt (again). There's nothing reasonable about that in my opinion. 

If you feel like a part of you want affection and love, my advice would be - do not give up on this. There's no easy way to find love. It takes risks, time, a pinch of madness and a whole lot of bravery. I personally recommend a therapy, while dating. It will help you to manage your emotions and to clear your head. 

Anyway, good luck! Do not let the fear stop you, because you deserve to love and to be loved."

He responded by saying he ‚Äúprefers to go with the flow‚Äù and just ‚Äúhang out‚Äù whenever it works out; he knows that‚Äôs not good for a relationship, but that‚Äôs how he‚Äôs lived for 15 years and ‚Äúthat‚Äôs all he can offer right now.‚Äù 

He also made a comment about it being too fast, which might be fair. I wasn‚Äôt demanding a relationship though, I just wanted to be intentional about making time for each other. In my opinion, if you‚Äôre both looking for a life partner, asking to see each other once a week and maintain communication in between isn‚Äôt too much to ask. I can‚Äôt build an emotional connection or any momentum toward a relationship with less than that. 

Maybe he can, or maybe he‚Äôs a 40 year old bachelor because he‚Äôs avoidant and/or afraid of commitment. Either way, it doesn‚Äôt matter.

The thing is he gives me very mixed signals. Like every once in awhile he‚Äôll just kiss me and we hold hands. Back in the fall he texted me he loved me when he was drunk. The next day he acted like nothing happened and he disappeared for a month‚Ä¶I also didn‚Äôt reach out to him. We ended up reconnecting and we never mentioned the text. He took me out to dinner (he always pays) and we were browsing this store and he bought me a dress I really liked.

How Should I proceed w/ Her?",**removed,"You are over thinking this a hell of a lot for a reasonably attractive semi successful startup CEO who is also chill and who gets 60 matches a week. It probably wouldn't have mattered much but you really should have replied to her post tooth brushing text. That was a little weird. And for your follow up text you should have just said 'had a great time, when are you free to get together again'? Not, 'I don't think our communication styles are compatible...what do you think we should do'? Women want some enthusiasm coming their way after a date, not perceived problems (even if delivered in a joking way). I mean, what did you expect her to say after that? But either way I don't think it mattered what you said afterward. If she wanted to see you again then you'd have gotten away with all that. She obviously enjoyed the date in the moment but that's no guarantee that she wants to see you again when she wakes up the next day.

Also, that 'really, LOL' reply likely buried any chance she'd ever come back around. All you can say at that stage is that it was nice meeting her and for her to reach out down the road if she ever changes her mind. Then move on. Being petty or passive aggressive about it gets you nowhere. And honestly, when she read that she probably thought 'yeah, made the right call there'.

I once had a great date...went similarly, great kiss at the end, initiated by her. As she was getting into her Uber she said 'I expect a second date from you Mister'. I thought to myself afterward, 'this is really someone I am looking forward to seeing again'...doesn't happen often for me. Brief text exchange to make sure she got home safely. Then ghosted when I tried to set up the next date two days later (and on follow up text 5 days after that).  It is what it is, you can't over think it or it will drive you crazy. At least your date replied and was nice about it, which is honestly more than you can say for many others.

datingoverthirty,10rfw6u,1675309854.0,I feel like one-sided dating app exchanges weren't always this common,"As a 34 year-old male dating women, I'm quite familiar and versed with the usual slew of dating apps. I've had some amazing relationships and more casual experiences through apps over the last decade. The first year of the pandemic ground my dating life to a halt, but ever since getting back onto the apps, I've noticed something that's also been noticed by my friends who use dating apps: one-sided conversations with matches are extremely common.

It feels like *at least* every other exchange I've had with a match on online dating has been one of those weird situations where you instigate the chat and it becomes very clear that you are going to be the one carrying the whole conversation. You ask a thoughtful, open-ended question, you get a one sentence statement as a response. Rinse, repeat. My standard approach to messaging in the past has been to have 1-2 exchanges before suggesting a date, if the energy feels right. But these days, those first 1-2 exchanges are often so lethargic and one-sided in effort that I don't even bother bringing up the idea of meeting up for a date. This has always happened on apps, but I feel like it wasn't nearly as constant 3-4 years ago.

This is an oft-discussed problem with dating apps and I've seen some people chalk this up to the ratio of genders on dating apps. But from an experiential perspective, I don't buy that. Because like I said earlier, my friends who use dating apps (a wide spectrum of genders) are constantly bemoaning the same issue when we compare our dating lives. Is there some kind of mass burnout with dating apps, where people want to find other options but can't? So they stay on the apps and invest as little energy as possible? I don't know what to think of this and am open to any theories.

UPDATE: Well, this blew up! One thing that I just wanted to add is that I‚Äôm glad to see a bunch of people arguing that asking someone out after a few exchanges is too soon. I used to go for more exchanges before popping the question because that felt more natural to me, but a key part of why I‚Äôve shortened it down to a few exchanges is from reading threads on here and hearing from a few folks IRL about having anemic energy for dating app conversations and preferring to get right to the crux. Exchanging more messages still seems like the ideal thing to do, IMO, but it also seems like the general energy for that is declining.","I‚Äôve had the same experience lately.

About a day or so into light messaging with someone and I suddenly realize that I‚Äôm the only one asking any questions. And it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm grilling them for information like it‚Äôs an interrogation or anything. I know how to have a normal introductory conversation.

But goddamn if I don‚Äôt get tired of seemingly being the only one who *wants to know anything about the person I‚Äôm talking to*.

datingoverthirty,10r0m7q,1675272898.0,How to be sexier as a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù guy?,"(Note to mods: I posted a version of this a few days ago but deleted it quickly as it was too negative, I intend to leave this one up)

I‚Äôve never had great luck with women, especially for casual dating, but I‚Äôm at a point in life where I‚Äôd really like to explore casual sex and dating. I‚Äôm just not sure how to be sexually appealing to women looking for something casual as a relatively normal, nerdy guy (both in my OLD profiles and on the initial dates). 

I know how be attractive in the ‚Äúsweet, dependable partner‚Äù kind of way, but not so much in the ‚Äúexciting, sexy casual partner‚Äù way. The few women I‚Äôve dated mostly compliment me on my kindness, which is fine but I feel like that isn‚Äôt going to attract people with more casual intentions. I don‚Äôt feel like I have that edge some guys have.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I have some attractive qualities. I‚Äôm smart, I workout regularly, and I wear clothes that fit and style my hair, but despite that I haven‚Äôt had much success. 

I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm completely lacking in confidence, but I can be awkward at times and I don‚Äôt radiate confidence. I‚Äôm also not a dominant personality (in the non-BDSM sense), in that while I‚Äôm not passive I‚Äôm also not comfortable being in the lead 100% of the time inside and outside the bedrooms. I prefer more 50/50 dynamics. 

I find what women find sexy in normal men to be baffling at times. All I need to be interested in casual sex is someone who is decently physically attractive (but in my league), nice, attracted to me, and who I have enough in common with that we can have good conversation for an hour or two. And I can offer all that myself! But it seems like women have far higher and different standards. 

I also struggle with how to write a profile that is appealing for something casual. There‚Äôs no male equivalent to bikini or butt pics, and so I‚Äôm left with pictures and a profile that are basically the same ones I‚Äôd use when looking for something serious.  

So, how can a normal, nerdy guy like me be sexier to women? What am I missing?

Edit: To be clear, I think I‚Äôm pretty decent looking, I‚Äôm just not ripped/super toned. But I do workout often and have a full head of hair etc.

Edit 2: Also, I‚Äôm talking about causal dating in general, not just ONS/hookups.","

 My comment is likely not going to add much with regards to answering your question, but I had to comment on this paragraph. Sex is higher risk, with frequently lower reward, for women. We have the risk of violence and pregnancy when it comes to sex, and to make a very broad statement, it can be much more challenging for women to have an orgasm. Yes, yes I know there are so many variables to that, but to broadly stereotype - women are not guaranteed an orgasm with every sexual encounter like men are. So yes, for many women, the standards for a causal sexual encounter are drastically higher than men‚Äôs."
datingoverthirty,10qy7a9,1675267167.0,Got dumped after saying I love you,"I was dating someone for 5 months, he gave me house keys at Christmas, we spent entire weekends together, we met each others families after one month. He treated me so well and kindly, I fell head over heels.  He was everything I wanted in a partner. 

One night, I told him I loved him while laying in bed. He hugged me really tight and told me he loved me too. I noticed he never said it first but would always say it back. 

Fast forward a couple weeks, he is showing me something on his phone and he gets a text from a woman he was dating before me but they didn‚Äôt work out due to 2 hours distance. Which lead to a conversation about how they never stopped talking, so I was upset. I asked him to re-assure me with saying some nice things. 

He didn‚Äôt say I love you, so I brought it up, and said you didn‚Äôt say you loved me. He just sat in silence for 5 min, so I get up and say, if you don‚Äôt love me now, you probably never will. And that‚Äôs where I messed everything up. I was just upset and wasn‚Äôt thinking clearly. 

Next thing I know, we‚Äôre sitting on the couch, crying, and he‚Äôs telling me we should break up because he doesn‚Äôt want a serious relationship anymore. Mind you, we have a paid vacation in May, and I basically lived there except a couple nights to go home to my cats. 

So the next day, I return to move all my stuff out of his house. Silence the entire time, I say, well that‚Äôs everything, and go to grab the door and he says wait, can I have a hug? So I hug him and he starts crying really hard and then I left.

I am so hurt by this, and I‚Äôm wondering, is 5 months too soon to tell someone you love them? I don‚Äôt understand why he cried telling me goodbye. I was pathetic and reached out to him begging to be me with me last week. Well last night I blocked him on Facebook and I‚Äôm just trying to move on.

Can someone tell me in a nice way, where it all went wrong? Was it my immature comment? Did I rush things by saying I love you at 5 months?","5 months is not too soon to say I love you for a lot of people. However, he didn't feel that way about you and couldn't get serious with you. I don't think you were being immature, and based on his response of not wanting a serious relationship anymore, he probably never would've gotten to that point with you.

I want to feel comfortable being grumpy after a crappy day, occasionally looking like I just crawled out of a dumpster, calling at midnight to cry about stuff, asking him to pick me up at the car repair shop ... shit like that. You know, things you expect from a boyfriend/partner. 

I'd like to hear from other people who reached this transition point, especially after the end of a marriage/LTR. How did you know you were ready for a new kind of relationship? What changed? If you were already seeing someone, how did you let them know you now wanted something more? 

Believe it or not, I've never dated with the intention of finding a long-term partner - all my relationships grew out of casual situations that got serious. I don't want to get hitched anytime soon, but I don't want to lead with my party girl side, either.","40M here.  When my ex-wife left in 2018, I spent about a year doing the ""casual"" thing.  I wasn't mentally or emotionally ready for another LTR yet, and honestly, I just wanted sex and companionship.  So for a little while, that's what I got.  I had a few one night stands, a casual FWB sort of thing for a couple of months, and then I dated this girl for about two weeks who was fun but kinda crazy (and definitely *not* LTR material).  But to tell you the truth, none of it ever really satisfied.  Like you said, I wanted something *real*.  And after that year had passed, along with some counseling, I was able to get over my ex, I stopped blaming myself for things that weren't my fault, I started liking myself again, and I figured out *exactly* what I really wanted/needed out of a healthy relationship.  So once I started taking dating seriously again (i.e. with the intent of finding a LTR), I was able to be open and vulnerable enough with prospective partners to actually make that happen.

What you said about ""being grumpy after a crappy day, occasionally looking like I just crawled out of a dumpster, calling at midnight to cry about stuff, asking him to pick me up at the car repair shop""... that's all the *best* stuff.  It's not the nights out or the bar hopping or the weekend getaways or even the sex.  It's the *real* stuff.  It's doing *life* together.  It's cooking dinner and doing the dishes afterward.  It's holding hands in the car and singing along with the radio.

I have a rule where I definitely don‚Äôt want to have sex with dates dates until I feel like it could go somewhere. And I tell the guys I want to take it slow/easy. 
And to be fair, I find it not as common that I have that kind of strong attraction to someone, so I can keep it in check.

Something recently happened with someone, and I felt that intense attraction and sex did happen multiple times over the course of a weekend spent together with someone I was getting to know over the course of a month. 
It was our first time meeting and we had some little drama (before meeting) but anyway, it ended up in a rejection from his side (I am certain I do know the reason why he didn‚Äôt see me long term material)
So, it sucks. A lot.

Also I want to say, even tho I loved our time and the sex was amazing, I now pretty much feel like I regret having broken my own rules so easily , because I couldn‚Äôt contain that energy. 

Any tips, or suggestions, or stories that feel similar. Please comment away as I‚Äôm a little bruised right now x","The main reason not to have sex too quickly is to avoid becoming emotionally attached before you‚Äôve had time to think about them objectively. You‚Äôre more likely to overlook red flags if you‚Äôre already sleeping together. 

The right person won‚Äôt care if you have sex on the first or second date, and the wrong person will ghost you afterward even if it has been a month or two (I‚Äôve seen that happen in threads here, and I‚Äôve experienced it personally). 

If you do want to wait, you just have to plan for it. Don‚Äôt have dates at your homes, and don‚Äôt agree to go back there after a good date, no matter the chemistry. Tell them you want to take it slow and stick by it. 

But if you ‚Äúbreak the rules‚Äù? Don‚Äôt feel bad about it. There‚Äôs no guarantee of a particular outcome either way. Just do what feels best and be kind to yourself."

datingoverthirty,10ph8fv,1675120323.0,Really hit it off with a family friend visiting from overseas but we live on opposite sides of the planet. Help!,"A family friend (40M) visited my (32F) parents' house over the past week. My younger brother and I spent a lot of time with him showing him the sights of Sydney, Australia.

We really hit it off - very interesting and deep conversations coupled with a shared heritage/cultural background. I was born in Australia to immigrant parents who are Croatian - he grew up in Croatia but moved to Vienna in his 30's. He is definitely what we call a 'freshie' here in Oz.

Before he left, he told me that meeting me was the highlight of his trip and he was surprised how open-minded, intelligent, and engaging I was (we met a few times in the past but I was quite young).  We could both tell there was chemistry and he ended up asking me for my number after encouraging me to stay with him in Vienna when I visit Europe this year.

Anyways, I don't know where to go with this. I do plan on going to Europe to spend some time with him. A part of me is interested in seeing where this could go but another part realises that long-distance relationships, relocating for love, etc etc is very hard. We both have established lives, my job is impossible to do in Europe (I would need years of re-training and learning German, which I will likely never master well enough to practice), he has family and friends in Croatia and Austria, and who knows how compatible we really are.

My best friend actually married an Austrian and moved to Linz a few years ago - it has been really hard. She finds there are definite cultural differences between Austria and Australia, is quite lonely, has trouble finding a job, and has fallen into a sort of depression.

We wound up frustrated because I couldn‚Äôt fly back out to see her for a few months after she‚Äôd flown here to meet, and then Covid hit.

Well, here goes nothing‚Ä¶ üòÇ

I live in [edit] (England) in a fairly rural location. Much of the working age job market is seasonal/retail/hospitality, so a lot of folks move away and the demographics are quite skewed toward retirees.

I‚Äôm here because of my job, which initially was out of my control but then I met my ex via Tinder and we were together for 8 years which included getting married. I‚Äôm on a program for my career that locks me into this location for at least a couple more years because my ex needed to stay local for his kid from a previous relationship. The ex and I have been separated for over a year and the divorce is in progress, and I‚Äôm looking to dip my toe into the dating pool‚Ä¶

I‚Äôm hoping to attract someone with a stable job, ideally in a professional field and hopefully with some understanding of a pressured work environment/demanding career. I‚Äôm attracted to a wide range of appearances and don‚Äôt mind someone follicularly challenged or heavier built.

My dealbreakers are smoking, kids & right wing politics/antivaxxers.

I have come across some profiles that catch my eye in terms of my preferences, but they are all incredibly outdoorsy. It does seem to be the main reason people actively choose to live here. Got as far as a second date with one and it was clear he was really looking for someone as intensely active as he was.

I feel a bit of a black sheep in that I‚Äôm not very ‚ÄòType A‚Äô personality in the other realms of my life - e.g., I know I don‚Äôt have a particularly feminine appearance and I could enhance that with more make-up & styling but day-to-day with work it feels there isn‚Äôt much point and I don‚Äôt enjoy the time/effort it takes. My exercise capacity is slightly limited by a longterm health condition and I‚Äôm pretty picky about the sports/types of exercise I enjoy due to how injury prone this condition makes me but if I can go at my own pace and guided by my body, I enjoy some sports immensely (snowboarding, skiing, swimming & cycling in particular). My body size/shape reflects that I don‚Äôt exercise regularly but good food/eating out/cooking are things I enjoy. Also it seems mandatory here to REALLY love dogs and I just don‚Äôt. 

All photos are from within the last year except the 2 snowboarding ones (first & fourth). Between Covid and my ex‚Äôs introversion/narrow interests, I haven‚Äôt done a whole lot except work in the last couple of years so my choice of recent photos is limited and not particularly representative, if that makes sense. Most of my friends either work conflicting schedules, have kids, or live far away.

I am leaning towards not having kids myself but it‚Äôs up for discussion. I‚Äôm aware time is not on my side which is one of the reasons I‚Äôm not simply seeking something casual until I can move away - but I would stay for the right person and there are advantages and things to love about the area. With company, I could definitely see myself getting into hobbies which make the most of the natural environment here.

I think I am probably looking for mythical creature who‚Äôll meet my criteria and accept me at face value, and/or have a mismatch of standards in a geographical area that‚Äôs already thin on the ground in terms of singles, but comments and tips gratefully considered! Thank you!

datingoverthirty,10p4acn,1675089549.0,Feeling anxious and in a funk after finding out what the man I was pursuing was really like,"TLDR starts in the middle.

Posted in here a couple times about a guy 30M I was seeing (31F [just turned 31]). His communication became worse around Christmas after our 4th date, he had flaked on plans a few times, always claiming to be sick.

The first guy I really liked in a long time and I was trying to give him the benefit of the doubt. I really saw potential in us. Two weeks ago I said I can only move forward with this if he puts in more effort, especially with communication, and he agreed, but then made no change. I told him it‚Äôs okay if he wants to take it slow, but at the end of the day all he was doing was breadcrumbing and leaving the door slightly open so he could come back when it‚Äôs convenient for him rather than taking the out. 

Edited section: His ex and I ending up getting in contact with one another.


TLDR.

He‚Äôs a serial cheater. He was with his ex for almost four years, they lived together, and he cheated on her multiple times. I knew he was between apartments and that‚Äôs how we connected via OLD because he was staying with his family and I lived nearby. Clearly did not share with me he was kicked out by his ex. Their relationship ended much more recently than he led on and had I realized that and the seriousness of it, I would have known he was not ready for a relationship even though his dating profile had ‚Äúlooking for a relationship.‚Äù

During the entire length of the time we were involved he was trying to win his ex back by sending her flowers and letters, seeing me, but also heavily active on the apps trying to meet up with even more women. He pulled away from me when he moved back to where he was living before (about 50 min from me). Prior to him pulling away we spoke often of the dates we would go on once he was back there because it‚Äôs more of a city.

He‚Äôs insatiable. His poor ex.
I feel embarrassed and foolish that I fell for a man like this. I suppose I feel lucky to have only wasted ~3 months of my life due to him, but it caused all these insecurities and anxious feelings to come up and I‚Äôm having a hard time shaking the experience. I can‚Äôt stop thinking about it. I communicated, I was vulnerable, I thought I did everything right. Being a rebound is horrible, especially when you don‚Äôt know the whole story and think you‚Äôll be in a relationship with someone and then realize you fell for an incredibly toxic person.

I could keep rambling about my thoughts and feelings on the matter, but I‚Äôll leave it at that.

How do you trust people again after something like this?",Reading your previous post it sounds like you always knew something was off. You have to learn to listen your gut and walk away sooner. Its not just about trusting other people. This guy never really gave you a reason to trust him. You have trust yourself.
datingoverthirty,10ovqmb,1675063137.0,I (32f) met someone (28m) networking,"So I (32f) met a guy (28f) at a networking event recently, and it‚Äôs a community that I would like to remain involved with as I‚Äôm early on in my career change. 

There was an instant physical attraction between the both of us, and I asked him out. We exchanged contacts, parted ways, and he asked me for drinks later the same night. Then we went on a scheduled date later in the week. We had a good time together, but I‚Äôm having difficulty reading him and getting a sense of who he is under the surface. In general, he comes off either as guarded, or as someone who struggles with making deeper connections. It‚Äôs also possible he was micro dosing bc he mentioned it on the date and that could explain why I felt it difficult to connect. 

Now the first real red flag is that he has not been in a relationship for 8+ years, and I haven‚Äôt been able to figure out *why* he hasn‚Äôt been in a relationship for so long. He‚Äôs not on the apps, but surely he could have had something happen organically? When I asked, he didn‚Äôt say much more than it just hasn‚Äôt happened for him. 

The second issue, he‚Äôs not a great kisser and he doesn‚Äôt come off as very passionate or experienced. In my personal history, I have never/rarely had a positive sexual encounter with someone who wasn‚Äôt a good kisser (‚Äúgood‚Äù is obviously subjective). 

So I‚Äôm struggling with what to do here. I‚Äôm not seeing serious-relationship-potential, and if we move into a casual relationship, I doubt it would be sexually satisfying. But I also don‚Äôt want to burn a bridge professionally, and he‚Äôs a nice guy and don‚Äôt want to hurt him. He also told me on the date that he was asked to become an organizer for the networking community we met at, which adds a small layer of complication bc I am also active in the community (1-2 times a month).

Essentially looking for advice on how to break things off in a way that we can maintain a positive professional relationship, or advice on if I should keep seeing him until I figure some of this stuff out.

ETA: This guy had one relationship, totaling 2 years, starting in high school and ended when he was 19. 
He has not been in any relationship since then. *He has never had an adult relationship.* 

In this particular sub, *dating over 30*, I would not have anticipated how many people think this isn‚Äôt a problem for a woman who has been in multiple serious relationships. Honestly tired of these comments. I did not make any personal attacks, rather expressed this is a red flag *for me*, which it is.",">Now the first real red flag is that he has not been in a relationship for 8+ years, and I haven‚Äôt been able to figure out why he hasn‚Äôt been in a relationship for so long.

As somebody who wasn't in a relationship for a similar amount of time, I always despised this question. It's not like there's a nice succinct explanation. It's some messy combination of current life situation, mental health, social anxiety, desire, figuring myself out. If I ever wanted to truly answer it would be more like a therapy dumping session, which I'm not gonna do with somebody I just met. ""it just hasn't happened"" is the only answer you're gonna get to this right now.

But it sounds like you're not very into this guy anyway. The kindest thing is to break it off clearly and firmly, without ambiguity. It might be a bit awkward if you see him around after, but it'll be much less awkward than if you continue seeing him, despite not seeming very into him, and then break things off.

datingoverthirty,10owefp,1675065641.0,Update on me (30F) going on a date with (23M),"So I previously posted here about meeting this guy 7 years younger than me on NYE and I got some good advice, whether they were for/against it and anywhere in the middle.

I ended up going on a date with him and we had a great time! We‚Äôve actually been dating for the past month and he asked me to be his girlfriend last week.

We‚Äôve been pretty communicative about what we‚Äôre looking for and he himself was the one that brought up his desire to get his career established, get married, and have a family when he‚Äôs financially stable. It‚Äôs a very mature outlook and he told me that he hasn‚Äôt been able to connect well with girls his age, or even friends, since they‚Äôre mostly interested in partying and not focused on building their lives. He told me that he doesn‚Äôt look for a specific age to date and when he saw me initially he thought I was actually around his age. But his last couple exes happened to be between 28-32. And all of his friends are around 28. 

He is honestly one of the most thoughtful and attentive guys I‚Äôve dated. He is always taking initiative to plan dates, cook for me, take my dog out for me, do my dishes after we cook, be the driver when we go somewhere, etc. I appreciate every single thing he does for me and I tell him he doesn‚Äôt have to do so much. I keep trying to pay him back whenever he gets me groceries and he refuses to let me so I have to hide money in his belongings for him to find later. I do cook for him, clean after, and plan dates too, drive, etc. too I‚Äôm just definitely not used to a guy being so proactive.

He‚Äôs totally aware of our differences in career stages as he‚Äôs still in school and working on getting his career started. But he‚Äôs has clear goals, is hardworking and works full time while being in school, going to the gym regularly, and finding time for me. I honestly wasn‚Äôt disciplined like that when I was 23.

I know I‚Äôm taking a chance to see how he changes and how it goes with his school/career a few years down. That‚Äôs a chance I‚Äôm willing to take right now. He makes me smile and laugh a lot, he enjoys the same hobbies that I do and is open to trying new things, we both don‚Äôt like drinking, and the sex is amazing. I was super hesitant about him at first because of his age, but after getting to know him, I haven‚Äôt been so excited to date someone in a long time.

Maybe it won‚Äôt work out, maybe it will. I‚Äôm hopeful but also realistic that I could waste time. But I won‚Äôt know unless I try!

Open to advice and comments, whether it‚Äôs in support of or against. TIA.","I think I'll be that guy.  First, I'm glad things are working out...BUT...    
I know you keep talking about how he's focused on his career and wants to settle down and isn't into partying (whatever that means), but I don't necessarily think that's as great as you think it is.  Just cause he says he wants all that, doesn't mean he knows how to get there, nor what he wants from a partner with which he wants to do all that with.    
I'm saying this as someone who dated someone that young when I was in my 30s.  I was initially impressed by her poise and intelligence, and she def wanted to get married and have kids....but the issues came after we started to work in that direction.  Bottom line, she had no real life experience.  She just didn't know how to be in a relationship with someone else.    
So yeah, right now the honeymoon phase feels great, and you definitely should enjoy all of that, but just be prepared if his inexperience starts showing a few months down the line.  You're going to need to determine if you want to put in the extra effort needed to deal with all that."
datingoverthirty,10oslei,1675052653.0,Totally confused,"So let me start by saying I‚Äôve stepped back from trying to date since November.  I really want to focus my energy on myself right now.  Dating takes a lot, and I only do it when I feel super positive and on top of my game otherwise I have a bad experience and I get resentful.

However a friend of one of my friends apparently saw me on Facebook.  Yeah I‚Äôm an elder millennial so I‚Äôm still on Facebook.  Anyway he asked my friend about me and expressed interest.  I told my friend he could add me and I‚Äôd accept and then he could get a sense of who I am.  I use FB sort of as a journal and I post little stories about my life and stuff.  Also he could see my pictures.  This was back in December.  

We chatted a lot at first on Messenger but I realized I‚Äôm very verbal and that he wasn‚Äôt keeping up with me so, embarrassed, I backed off.  I do my best to match energy with someone.  He wanted to meet so we did and he was more attractive than i thought he would be but we didn‚Äôt really flirt or anything.  He seemed almost like he wanted to kiss me at the end.  But he didn‚Äôt.  

I wasn‚Äôt sure how I felt because I‚Äôm not in the mood to date and he and I do seem to have different energies.  He has a more serious and muted energy and I would say mine is unselfconscious and expressive.  I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm ‚Äúfunny‚Äù but I‚Äôm usually amusing and humorous and I find a lot of things funny and I laugh easily.  I guess I feel more connection to people who are funny or who seem to enjoy me and with this guy neither seems to be the case.

But he‚Äôs nice enough and not bad looking, seems to have good morals.  So I guess I feel lukewarm and I was okay if he wasn‚Äôt very interested.  His communication really slowed down after we met and I figured that was that but then he asked me out again and had a thoughtful date suggestion (paint bar) 

We met tonight and he bought the paint bar tickets but I bought his food and drink and we had a decent time.  He walked me to my car but he was lingering and I didn‚Äôt know why so I just kept talking bc I didn‚Äôt know what else to do.  So I talked and talked for 30 min.  I told him I need to be interrupted, because my mouth doesn‚Äôt have breaks.  Especially not when I‚Äôm nervous.  If we were having dinner I would be able to focus on talking less and drawing him out more but since I didn‚Äôt know why we kept standing next to my car, I just rambled.  Again at the very end it seemed like he was trying to figure out how to kiss me but we only hugged.

When I got home he messaged right away but we still only use messenger and he never asked for my number.

I can‚Äôt figure out if we like each other or not.  I really can‚Äôt tell if he likes me or not.",The question isn‚Äôt if he likes you. The question is if you like him.

datingoverthirty,10ofji7,1675019102.0,How to enjoy the dating process more while working through communications fatigue due to a job involving a lot of communications and stakeholder management?,"I (early 30s M) have a job requiring a lot of detailed communication, navigating ambiguity, problem solving, and conflict resolution with a high number of team members and organizational stakeholders. I'm sure any of you in a project/product/program+ manager or above can relate to how absolutely mentally taxing this can be sometimes, even if it's fulfilling and even if you're clocking in a normal 40-hour workweek with fairly healthy professional boundaries.

I feel like I've been stuck in a loop where I spend whole workdays communicating, communicating, and communicating some more in an empty and unsatisfying way, only to ""log off"", pivot to my personal life, and be confronted with... what feels like a lot more of the same? Especially as a guy, the transition from firing off emails on Outlook all day to firing off openers on Hinge in the evening (most of which effectively disappear forever upon send) has just left me feeling profoundly disconnected from what life and romance should be. I imagine for the ladies in these job roles, the after work transition means joylessly scrolling through an inbox of variable quality matches and wrangling an analogously exhausting decision making and comms-crafting loop. I get the impression that a lot of us that are ready to date and bring a lot to the table are really not having much fun at all with a matchmaking process that has become inorganic, unfruitful, and repetitive. Meanwhile, friend and hobby groups remain fulfilling, so those have been getting prioritized for mental health and personal development.. but those don't replace the desire for a partner (and unfortunately have not solved it either), and so this loop persists.

Can someone paint a more optimistic picture for me of what dating can look like in 2023 for us Dunbar's-number-saturated professional 30-somethings that want to be enjoying it but aren't getting anywhere near a satisfying outcome doing it? What are some strategies we can use to find each other and make it easier to connect that are, I don't know, more socially recharging, less taxing on the soul, and maybe a little serendipitous along the way?","I (34f) actually have a similar situation in that I'm energetically an introvert, but I'm very extroverted at work so I'm constantly talking, emailing, IMing, etc. Don't get me wrong, I love being social at work, but afterwards I'm totally mentally burnt out. It's actually been pretty prohibitive in dating or even going on apps, because I hate that petty ""how are you? What are you doing today? How was work?"" conversation - it's actually painful. I had this problem with my ex too because he would wait all day for someone to talk to (he was often unemployed and had no other friends) and after work all I wanted to do is relax, make dinner, and be in the same room as him...not talk nonstop. 


All of this is to say, I don't have an answer because I battle with the same issues. But if you do figure it out, I'd love to know lol."
datingoverthirty,10ojndy,1675028824.0,Openly seeking something casual in your bio as a guy,"So, I'm a guy and I've decided to lean into my casual side and see what it could be like to have an intimate connection with someone without the pressure of constantly judging whether I want to spend the rest of my life with them. So I changed my Tinder bio to the below.

_Warm and intense and goofy nerd obsessed about getting to the bottom of everything and getting better at everything._

_Let's climb/ski our hearts out, read aloud to each other while high, and with equal wonder, contemplate modern art and each other's hottest qualities._

_Looking on here for an FWB to leave each other giddy, enlightened, and better-than-we-found-it._

I think there's the idea that guys are not supposed to reveal or imply that they're looking for sex, but I seem to be getting about the same amount of matches (1-2 per day, a fraction of which turn into conversations) and I'm finding it liberating: now I know my match is okay with it being a casual thing and I don't need to waste my time on people who are not okay with that! It hasn't lead to any good dates yet (1 date, but not a good one), but it's also only been a week or two.

I can afford to narrow my pool somewhat, but I want to make sure I'm filtering for the right people. I guess I'm trying to project who I actually am in this side of myself - someone openly sex-positive, but not one-dimensional or objectifying - and looking for the same. For what it's worth, I used a _much_ spicier version of this on a spicier app (Feeld) and my ex approved it as being ""very much like the /u/unspecifieddude she knows""; getting some matches there too, but no conversations yet.

Looking for feedback: as a woman in my target audience so to speak, _when you were looking for or open to something casual / FWB_, would you have swiped right on this (assuming you found my photos attractive)? Or would you still be put off by it?","You‚Äôre up front and honest about what you‚Äôre looking for, I don‚Äôt see any issue with that.

Main reason being, I‚Äôm in a headspace where I ultimately want to connect with people who augment my energy, and I felt that with this woman. (She also said as much, actually.) If I was in my 20s and less mature, I definitely would have had a different mentality with this.

I realize it‚Äôs most likely a soft letdown. Not sure if I‚Äôm playing into being an acquaintance of convenience either, since she‚Äôs newer to the area and doesn‚Äôt have as many friends yet.

 I was initially attracted to his pics but the more I've seen, the more I'm kinda concerned about whether or not I will find him attractive in person. 

I'm really worried about it because I feel like I'm leading him on to think there will be a relationship when I'm not sure. I'm not doing that intentionally, but when we talk, it's hard not to say flirty things, etc. 

Can anyone offer advice on how to handle this current situation or how to handle it if we meet and I'm not attracted at all? We've gotten so close that I almost feel obligated to be attracted and date him. I know attraction can grow over time..but I'm worried. 

And I hate to say this...but part of me is worried about the disappointment I might feel that I didn't end up with a more physically attractive person. Like ideally, I would find someone that I find irresistible.  

Just not sure how to deal with this or navigate out of it if we meet and his appearance is too much of a deal breaker for me. 

Or advice on being a better person that would not care about physical attraction? Lol",Meet as soon as possible. And reduce interactions with him until you meet.
datingoverthirty,10o06he,1674970968.0,The Unimportance of the Breakup Talk,"Last week a woman I had been seeing for a short time sent me a breakup text. I poured over every word, trying to figure out where it all went wrong. What did she mean by ""incompatible"" and ""different lifestyles?"" What does ""not what I'm looking for"" translate to?

And then I put my phone down. And a few minutes later I was reading the text again, like it was the Rosetta stone leading to my understanding of dating happiness. 

Somewhere around my fifth pass through her text I realized I was wasting my time for two reasons:

1. Even if I understood exactly what she meant I wasn't going to be working on convincing her she was wrong. We dated for a short time, she was done, I was moving on. If she had put some actionable objective feedback in there (I don't shower often enough, my apartment is ugly, etc) I might be able to improve but otherwise these were situation specific items.

2. She might not have meant a single word she said anyway.

We all say stuff when we break up. Sometimes it's platitudes to spare the other person's feelings (really to make us feel better about breaking up with them) and sometimes it's just stuff you say. Goodness knows I've broken up with a woman who I wasn't physically attracted to and gave every reason but that one 

I remember breaking up with one woman who was mentally picking out our wedding invitations and she lobs out, ""we're in very different places in our lives"" despite the fact she would have sworn to opposite five minutes earlier. She just needed to say something to make herself feel like the breakup was her idea too.

We all want to think we're in control of our lives and the other person isn't leading the charge. We have a wide slew of ego defense mechanisms, one of which is lobbing out nonsense phrases during a breakup like ""different lifestyles.""

Anyone here ever heard or said something incredibly stupid during a breakup just because someone just needed a reason?","I had an ex break up with me,  no reason given, over text. My response was ok. She than responded calling me names, saying that the fact that I didn't fight for her was why was breaking up with me.

So I asked her what she meant. Apparently after breaking up with me she expected me to beg for her to take me back and list the things I would do for her.  I said ok, and blocked her number.  I'm not playing those type of games

Edit: just to add a couple things, she was 32, didn't have bpd as far as I knew but we only dated 2 1/2 months so maybe she did."

datingoverthirty,10nfwho,1674914874.0,Feeling disillusioned with romantic relationships,"Hi everyone. I'm not really sure what I'm looking for, maybe advice, maybe sympathy. 

I am a 37 F. I'm feeling pretty disappointed and disillusioned with romantic relationships. I'm unsure if this is just a phase I'm going through but I've been feeling this way for a few months and I don't see my attitude changing anytime soon.

Some background : I was in a 7 year relationship that ended early 2020. He treated me fairly well, especially in the beginning. Except one major problem - he never wanted to have sex. Towards the end of our relationship it had been three years. I tried problem solving this-suggesting therapy, talking about this, etc. He did not want to do any kind of therapy. Eventually it came out that he was more attracted to specific friends of his that he had worked with 10 years younger. I decided to end that relationship upon learning that. Also I wasn't ready to commit to a life of celibacy. I do think he's actually either very low-libido or ace, based on some things he told me about his past, but he would never admit this. 

He wasnt too bad as far as doing chores around the house but I had to basically be the manager - which I found annoying. He wouldn't do anything unless I asked. Occasionally he'd blow up at me if I asked him to clean something, but generally he would do his part in cleaning our home. 

He now is married. When we were dating he talked about how I was the love of his life and marriage was just a piece of paper to him. I was fine with that, and looking back, I'm glad we didn't get married. I hate that I even care about this but it does annoy me because it makes me wonder if he was even being honest about that. Also he proposed rather quickly to his new wife (who is noticeably not physically attractive) , they ""fell in love"" very quickly. That also makes me wonder if his ""falling in love with me"" was just him desperately trying not to be single. I question all of that time spent and if it was even real and genuine. 7 years was a huge chunk of my life. 

After that relationship I had an insanely high sex drive, after being celibate for so long. I even had some guys I was only seeing for sex - wasn't ready for a relationship. 

After about 8 months I met a new guy through a mutual sport we both play. He was very good looking, and he seemed shy, which I thought was cute. I pursued him, and we ended up dating for about 2.5 years, off and on. For the first year and a half, I was absolutely crazy about him. I loved him so much, I put in so much effort for him. He was not affectionate and not really giving me what I needed. I tried to talk about love languages, make sure I was meeting all of his needs, I tried to do little things for him that showed how much I cared. None of this changed his behavior towards me. He  would never tell me he loved me, he wasn't physically affectionate. And whenever I'd bring anything up (I tried to be as gentle as possible), he'd get really defensive and deflect onto me. Also, he very rarely initiated sex, and turned me down pretty often, which was really hard on my self esteem, coming out of another deadbedroom relationship already. I started to be convinced that I wasn't loveable. Our relationship ended up becoming a toxic trauma bonding mess. We broke up and got back together about 15 times. He was verbally abusive, would never take accountability for anything, and constantly gaslighting me (I. E. I'd apologize for something and he would keep saying I hadn't apologized). He didn't have his shit together, he was behind on his bills but hid it from me, his house was a mess. He came to live with me during part of our relationship but he would make messes and not clean them up and also wouldn't help Contribute to keeping a clean house. I loaned him 8k to get a car because his car broke down and I was sick of him trying to borrow mine constantly. He said he would pay back within 2-3 months. Well, obviously that didn't happen. I decided to break the cycle and end our relationship in late November. I blocked him on everything so that we don't contact each other. 

Towards the end of our relationship I basically lost my sex drive. I rarely orgasmed with him the few times we had sex because he lasted about one minute and didn't make any effort. Unfortunately I still don't have a sex drive and it worries me. I feel like I'm just giving up on sex. And relationships. I'm not convinced that they are actually worth it. Seems like a lot of hassle and not necessarily a lot of benefit. 

Also I like to have a pretty tidy house and after living with a few guys I find it draining having to have lots of discussions about how they're not doing their part (No, I don't phrase it that way) which turns into fights. It's easier just to live by myself and not have to deal with someone else's mess. I'm worried that I will never be able to find someone who I can live with and I feel like they're contributing their fair share. 

I have been on OLD, I went on a couple of dates here and there. But I generally don't feel sparks from OLD. We have nice conversations but Im not really drawn to them and nothing ties us together-95% fizzle out. And most of the guys on OLD that message me are not at all my type or have giant red flags in their profiles. 

Anyway, it just makes me sad because I feel honestly jaded and I don't want to feel this way. I don't have much desire to date and I feel very cynical about relationships and marriages. I have no desire to have sex either. I feel lost. I just feel like giving up on relationships and accepting a single life forever, even though that's not at all how I imagined my life an did really like to be in a loving and fulfilling relationship. Just seems out of reach. Any words of wisdom?","Your two longest relationships were with people who didn't show affection for you in ways that you needed. Your 7 year didn't want to have sex, and it sounds like your 2.5 was more of a vampire that took without giving. Is it possible you feel more attraction to distant, avoidant men, and are less attracted to warm ones who seem more forthcoming with affection? Maybe you find these people too bright and bubbly, or you think they'll be players, or they rub you the wrong way for whatever reason? I don't know the answer to that, but it's not hard to see why you're tired of dating-- your needs have never been met. 

I think you need to come to your relationship thinking ""OK, buddy, if you're going to be in my life, what do you actually bring to the table. What do I have that I didn't before you came along. Deliver something or walk. Warmth? Affirmation? Mutual encouragement? Anything? ...Enrich my life, don't sully the space."" You're allowed to have your own demands and desires-- it seems like you've settled into the role of taking up less space in your relationships and trying to make them happy, which is really easy for women to do. But you have gotten walked all over! (8k for a car, holy fuck.) And then you haven't even gotten the emotional security of feeling wanted and loved for who you are out of it. If warmth and affection and desire are all important for you, you need to demand them in your life or walk before it festers. But, you also need to want those things for yourself! If you're finding yourself attracted to men who don't have the capacity to give you that, you need to cut ties before your need to ""earn/win"" these things from them takes over. I feel for you, because I have definitely done a lot of this myself."

We talk about relationship goals and etc. I work hard to make it clear I don‚Äôt I don‚Äôt want hook ups. The last one was totally in agreement. Finally, we are ready we have sex and it‚Äôs mutually awesome. 

Then, like clockwork, after about 3 times, I get a message about how they don‚Äôt know what they want but they would like us to stay friends. They don‚Äôt want to hurt me blah blah. 

The most recent time was very hurtful because, for all intents and purposes, we were really compatible (they said so). The person was flirting with me over text. We had to see each other less in person because of distance, their work, and my limitations on driving. Still, conversation was good and had been sexually oriented. 

Then I get the speech about why we can‚Äôt continue sleeping together and acting on those feelings. The most recent time it was within an hour of the flirty conversation. I called them out and they apologized.

Regardless of how polite they are, i‚Äôm getting really tired of this trend. I said okay to friendship because I was on the spot and am generally pretty agreeable when they are polite about it.

As I think about it more, however, I feel frustrated and pissed. It‚Äôs been about two days and I kind of want to let them know: While they could be a really good friend, i suspect i‚Äôll never hear from them again. I don‚Äôt want to make all the effort, alone. I‚Äôm not in the market for friends. I want to date and i want an actual break up, at least. None of these empty promises. 

Do I even say anything? Part of me really wants to let them know how I feel skeptical and insulted. (I am tactful and polite, FWIW). They tell me how much they want friendship and value me and how i can reach out any time. What is there to say, though?

We are in our mid thirties. How can you not know what you want?

Everyone has baggage. Some more than others. It's about how they handle that baggage is the question. In regards to her kid, if it seems like she's basically abandoned her child, then I'd be out immediately. If it's more along the lines of, the grandparents took custody so she could have time to get her life together so she could provide for her child, that id understand. If she's still in school, I get it. If the kid was older and is now or nearly an adult, I get it to a degree.

datingoverthirty,10mgwa4,1674811929.0,Best way to end things?,"I (M32) met this great woman(34) in October last year. We went on a couple of dates and had a few sleepovers. 
She is a mom of 2 and has a pretty busy lifestyle. She is the first woman I have connected with over many years. 

Then at the begging of Dec, the communication faded a little and we couldn't schedule things for some time(mostly just her insanely busy schedule, or maybe she just wasn't prioritising our meetups as I was). So I acted on emotion and ended things over a message. It was a mature conversation and we went on with our lives. 

I had a month to think clearly about the situation and reached out to her. She responded positively. Since then we have met another 3 times. This time she wanted to wait with having sex, which I liked too, gave a sober perspective to the situation. 

Right before our last Meetup something happened in my personal life and made me make a massive life change - moving to a different state. 

We met on Monday and ended things on a hot note that implies that next time we meet, we are likely to have sex again. 
Next few days I realised that I shouldn't carry on with it, especially getting intimate. 

We had a public holiday here on Thursday, so on Wednesday I was trying to setup a meet to end things in person. But then she got sick? And then disappeared mid convo? I had a really weird feeling about the situation, but I feel like she just decided to not deal with me for those few day offs that she had. First I felt gutted, just emotional because I really liked this woman and spending time with her, but then I thought this is the best case if she just ghosts me and the problem is solved on my end.

But she came back and texted me today, as if nothing happened? She is going away for the weekend and next week she has kids again. So I won't be able to see her for another 10+ days.

I wanted to do it in person, but now every scenario feels weird to me. 

Should I just message her or try to setup a meet? 

I know I suck, I feel quite horrible about reaching out, to just end things in a month again. I am also not the type of person to drag someone with me when I know I will be at the other end of the country in few months.","You are moving away. Let her move on. Call her up and end things. It won't be easy. It won't be fun but you need to have this conversation. It is a kind and respectful way to end the relationship. Waiting to meet in person just delays the inevitable.

Is there a tactful way to do this? 

I recently had a date that I was somewhat unsure about, but the conversation was good and it seemed promising and I wanted to remain open minded because, well, we met on the internet and you just don‚Äôt know until you meet up. I immediately felt zero attraction whatsoever and the vibe was also off.

But it got me thinking - if it wasn‚Äôt too much bother for either of us to get to the destination, and I really wasn‚Äôt feeling it, is it fine to leave shortly after meeting in person?

Also - how do we avoid this? Should phone calls beforehand be standard practice? I try to voice note at least but sometimes people don‚Äôt voice note back.

I was married very young to the first person I dated, have been divorced for two years, and since then have gone on dates with six people (four from OLD, two met IRL). One of those dates became a long FWB relationship, one became a months-long relationship, and four didn‚Äôt get past the first date. 

Two of my friends are adamant that I cannot claim to know what I want, not *really*, without more experience in relationships than this. Their argument is that without having had several relationships, I simply won‚Äôt know what‚Äôs out there, so won‚Äôt have a basis of experience to draw from in thinking about what I want in a partner. What‚Äôs more, they claim that a common pattern for guys (at least) is to get into a relationship, get really excited about it, then start to worry that perhaps they‚Äôre missing out on something better and bail to go look for it ‚Äî and that the only way to defeat this pattern is to go through it a couple of times so you don‚Äôt feel that pull away from the relationship.

This doesn‚Äôt seem exactly wrong to me ‚Äî after all, I can see how more experience could help a person know what they want and avoid maladaptive dating patterns.

Ask her what is she looking for right now in person at the end of a date.

So why do people need the label? I'm sure everyone has their own opinion, curious to hear a variety of responses.

EDIT: thanks for the great discussion. I've played the devil's advocate on some comments and gotten downvoted, understandably. But I've enjoyed engaging with all your varied perspectives on this subject.","So you understand everyone‚Äôs intentions. It‚Äôs not just bout how you feel and what you want, labels and communication allows you to find someone that fits your lifestyle and what you‚Äôre looking for.

There‚Äôs plenty of stories on here where they‚Äôve been dating 3-9 months, have no idea what‚Äôs goes on and finally ask only to be devastated when they realize it‚Äôs not what they want.

I've all but given up on dating but thought I would ask the internet mob its opinion. I get matches but not really the type of person I am looking for. I have my own opinions as to why this is. Here is some more information in my profile but not seen in the link above:

Age range: 29 and up ( I prefer women my age or older tbh)

Voice Prompt: ""I am a morning person and don't drink coffee""

Height: 5'10""

have kids: no

want kids: no

have pets: no

vaccinated: yes

drink: yes

drugs: no

smoke: no","I'm outdoorsy but your profile comes off a little toooo outdoorsy, almost judgmental about people who aren't outdoors and exercising all the time. Your pictures showcase that you're fit and often outdoors, so I don't think you need to mention exercise/outdoors in 2 other prompts, ya know? From your profile, I don't get a good read on who YOU are. It feels a little stiff, like you're really strict about your lifestyle and a woman wouldn't fit in unless she completes iron mans regularly and has been to Patagonia. I think you could inject more fun into your voice prompt. I like the morning person thing (also a morning person!) but this is a good place to add some humor and originality in.

Otherwise I think your pics are strong. You could consider replacing the tan suit sunglasses one (not a fan of sunglass pics)."
datingoverthirty,10ls0ci,1674740358.0,What is a common opinion held on this sub in particular that you don't find true in real life?,"For me, I think its the assumption that anytime a guy isn't 100% responsive (slight exaggeration), that he must be married and cheating on his spouse.  I've never encountered that opinion IRL, but on here, damn near every post that mentions a man being a bit distant, that is a response that is highly upvoted.

What are some others?

Note:  I think this is a good conversation because sometimes this sub becomes an echo chamber that I don't think reflects real life attitudes to things.","There‚Äôs a bit of a selection bias that happens in this sub where most of us are here because we need to vent about some aspect of dating. It‚Äôs not unusual imo for this sub to have a bit of echo chamber going on because most of us are having some sort of difficulty dating.

datingoverthirty,10lixff,1674705764.0,What is a reasonable goal for dating in your thirties?,"I (32F) have been considering marriage as a goal at the end of dating. It has not been before. I didn't grow up or surround myself with many married friends or value marriage that much. I have a few committed relationships but backout a few years in because I am ambivalent about children and marriage. I wish to remain childfree but the men I meet don't have kids and they are looking to have them.  I am currently dating without intentions due to my schedule and focus on career. I will perhaps resume dating seriously in my late thirties for better chance of dating men who already have kids.

So my question is do you date with a marriage goal in mind or just commitment or none at all? If the former, how did you date with such an intention or switch your mindset to get the commitment of marriage?","I think these are realistic relationship goals to pursue:

- Reliable, mutual, and consistent source of affection and emotional support
- Be the trustworthy emergency contact for each other
- Build and share a stable, comfortable, and fulfilling lifestyle together
- Have each other‚Äôs back no matter what happens in life"

datingoverthirty,10l85we,1674676994.0,Women: Is asking where your head is at after 3 dates too soon?,"So I normally like to do a temperature check after 3 dates just to see if we are on the same page in terms of can we see this actually going somewhere. 

I went on 3 awesome dates (over about 3.5 weeks) with a lady, with the last one ending in a sleepover (no sex) and the first two dates being 8 hours long. Last night I told her I was not interested in pursuing things with anyone else and asked her where he head was at, to which she replied things are moving way too quickly for her and today she shut us down completely, saying we‚Äôre in different headspaces.  

Now I‚Äôm wondering if I should reevaluate my 3 date conversation? I realize exclusivity is being suggested by me, but the conversation came about because we had already both paused our Hinges and said we were only dating 1 person at a time. Fast forward to last night I pulled up her profile to show a coworker her pictures and saw she had uploaded a new picture.","Perhaps it wasn't you asking where her head was at so much as after 3 pretty lengthy dates, she found herself feeling (as she said) like it was just too much too soon, but too late to pull back and slow down?"
datingoverthirty,10l3uiu,1674666889.0,questioning desire for commitment - what does it really mean?,"i 30F just got dumped by my ex 30M. he broke it off because i expressed j wanted commitment and that if he didn‚Äôt want the same thing to tell me asap. long story short, he eventually did after 6 months and i walked immediately - it was instinctive and emotional. 

but in the aftermath i realised i wanted commitment so badly because i didn‚Äôt want someone who didn‚Äôt care about me and would just up and leave without any attempt to resolve issues in the relationship. i‚Äôm not looking for marriage or a family and, like him, i am not sure what i‚Äôm going to do career wise or which country i‚Äôm going to settle in (expat life!). i figured if our paths deviated too much we would just break up and go out separate ways then.  

i guess i‚Äôm looking for wisdom on: how you know you wanted commitment, are there different types of commitment, can you have commitment without certainty of future, and what is the possibility that i am just changing my view on commitment because i wish i had had more time with this man?","> what is the possibility that i am just changing my view on commitment because i wish i had had more time with this man?


this seems likely. 


It‚Äôs hard because there are a lot of emotions involved with a break up but try to think of this as objectively as possible: what do you want, romantically? again, try to think about that not with any particular guy in mind but just in general‚Ä¶what are your goals?


if it helps at all, my goals are to be in a long term relationship that lasts the rest of my life. Saying that is one thing but understanding why I want that is another. I personally really appreciate the idea of companionship and building a life with another person. growing old with someone intrigues me and thus that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm looking for. 


It sucks when someone doesn‚Äôt see eye to eye with you but ultimately we have to look at it as a ‚Äúgood thing‚Äù in the grand scheme. Potentially wasting time with someone that was destined to end at some point or another is much worse than the immediate pain of a break up. 


This is also why I stress not only being authentic with other people but with ourselves too. We can‚Äôt be authentic with others if we don‚Äôt figure out what we want first. Figuring out what you want isn‚Äôt exactly easy (would highly recommend therapy to EVERYONE, not just people on this sub, because I learned a lot about myself in it) but oh my god is it rewarding"

datingoverthirty,10kmhbe,1674610358.0,Do I keep this to myself or do I openly talk about this with my boyfriend?,"I‚Äôve posted here before. Hi again, I‚Äôm back, lol. Me (32F) is dating my boyfriend (28M) for 4 months this Saturday.

We had a rough patch that we really went into and fully resolved. That was 2 months ago or even more. Since then, things have been really great. In the past 3 weeks, he‚Äôs been extra sweet (buying me flowers, complimenting me, accommodating my hectic schedule, being so kind, etc.). He‚Äôs told me he‚Äôs the happiest he has been with me and really likes me and really cares about me. He said he can totally picture us getting to the six month mark no problem and it‚Äôll be smooth sailing. He‚Äôs said he intends being serious with me/our relationship.

For me, I was infatuated for a while but that‚Äôs been uplifted and the last time I saw him I felt a surge of real and genuine feelings. I think I‚Äôve fallen for him. Hard to admit, because I have never (truly) loved another. I have a weird relationship history and I‚Äôm divorced and no I didn‚Äôt love my ex husband and yes it‚Äôs too long and complicated of a story.

I feel so strongly for him. I‚Äôm seeing him tomorrow. Do I not mention how I‚Äôm feeling (falling for him) and just continue as is for a few months OR do I open up and let him know where I‚Äôm at and be totally vulnerable? I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs there yet. I think he genuinely really likes and cares for me though.

I don‚Äôt want to say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm falling for you/I love you‚Äù too soon especially if he‚Äôs actually far away from that with me. Also, I‚Äôve never been in love (sadly) so I‚Äôm not even sure if that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm really feeling? Do I also just really like him as he really likes me? Is this love or what?

For context, I‚Äôm feeling very secure in this relationship and we text daily as schedules allow and we try to see each other twice a week if not once a week. He offers to FaceTime if it‚Äôs been a while and he always tries to see me when he can (so do I). He‚Äôll sometimes give me a phone call too. We laugh together, we have inside jokes, we don‚Äôt fight or bicker or argue, we bond over shared hobbies, we are sexually attracted to each other and the sex is great, we are kind to one another, we do cute things for each other, and he gives me the cutest look sometimes when we cuddle that makes me blush. I feel safe and secure with him and still can get butterflies when I kiss him after not seeing him.

I know his feelings have grown because of how he‚Äôs been the past three weeks. 

Do I clue him in on my stronger feelings or wait a few months? What do you all think? Is this love or just ‚ÄúI really like you?‚Äù feelings?

(I wish I knew what love was to properly identify but just never happened to me just yet or perhaps now it has - I know at 32 I should‚Äôve loved and be loved by now just not how things have happened in my life)

Edit: My feelings are really strong but I‚Äôve realized it‚Äôs not quite love just yet, but I shared to him where I‚Äôm at with my feelings and he expressed he‚Äôs feeling the same. We are still a new couple and have time to grow with feelings.","You need to be vulnerable,  sounds to me you can't believe it's true that it's this good so you are looking for it to fail. These kinda power plays of who shows more vulnerability end up hurting what was supposed to be a good relationship.


 Let him know how you feel. These are the things that will hold and support your relationship when it goes into crisis such as when you're fighting. You both will remember all the good days and want to do better. ..otherwise if the good days were marked by people holding back and not being vulnerable, there will be nothing to hold onto."
datingoverthirty,10k5y62,1674568312.0,Confused demisexual navigating an uncommon relationship style for me.,"EDIT: thank you all for the comments and I appreciate additional experiences if anyone wants to share. I'm going on a trip with him from the 11th-28th of Feb. We're both looking forward to that trip and I'm giving myself time to sort through my thoughts until then. Also digging into it more with my therapist who has so far encouraged me to follow his actions more than his words because words mean nothing. Will update as things progress. I'm super appreciative of the very direct feedback üôèüèΩ

I (29F) have been seeing this guy (33M) for about 5 months. We live a few hours apart but things have been pretty amazing since we met. Honestly one of the most intense and immediate sparks that has carried on for a while. We communicate a fair amount daily, video call often, when we see each other it's wonderful and explosive. We've discussed not being exclusive but it feels like things have been growing in a direction I'm happy with and I really think I'm falling hard for him.

We're both demisexual. Which really deepens the intensity of the connection both emotionally and sexually.

Personally, I've tried multi-dating and kinda had a hard time with it. As our closeness has grown, I find myself just not finding interest in other men. Feels like a waste of time. The bar is set so high, it feels almost impossible for anyone to meet it.

He says us not being exclusive and him not feeling the pressure of a relationship has helped him 'show up' better for me as a partner. We had a convo last night where he told me he's still been going on dates but the bar is set super high for him and he hasn't met anyone who comes even close. I also kinda knew this already bec there really is something special here that I don't think one just finds easily. But he says having to be 'tied down' or in a relationship where one is forced to commit makes it harder for him. He's been enjoying being able to focus on us because he wants to.

I'm conflicted because.. well.. the idea of this makes me uncomfortable but at the same time I'm getting the things I want. We talk all the time, we're super attracted to each other and this is the most sexually and intellectually fulfilling relationship I've had. He's really shown up for me recently during some rough times and I've been really happy. So why would I want it to change?

There's definitely an aspect of sexual exclusivity that I think I want. Because being demi makes it hard for me to separate sex from feelings and I don't know that I am ready for that. But in the long term I want something 'monogamish' where both partners are open to the fact that humans feel attracted to other humans and it would be good to be able to explore that at some point (but I mean way later down the road).

I also never want kids. No rush nor particular desire to get married. So I'm not sure why I should take issue with this if I'm getting what I want. I feel pretty secure in how good of a partner/catch I am that I'm not threatened by his dates.

Confused about whether this experiment is worth it or if it's reasonable for me to request something like sexual exclusively alone. Besides this difference of opinion, he's really everything I want in a partner. What do?",You want something exclusive. He doesn‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt think he set that bar very high.
datingoverthirty,10jydso,1674538967.0,Started dating this great guy! Im needing advice how to not fudge this up.,"I (35f) started dating this guy (30m) 6 weeks ago and everything is going great so far.

Now bec. of past experiences I turned into a very cautious woman in how i navigate a potential relationship. Anyway 3+ weeks of those 6 weeks i was away for work which he waited for me to comrback, he was very consistent through phonecalls, texts and i have a very stressful job and he was always there to listen to all whinges at the end of the day. 

He clocked in serious efforts and hours towards me, he would do errands for me if i needed something done while i was away, he would drive an hour to see me, he would take me out consisitently, so far.

We agreed 2 weeks ago to be exclusive after he found out that im still in a dating app which at that time i dont check anymore since i met him, he was hurt, he said he thought he made it clear how he feels towards me through actions, anyway now that i am back in our city, ive been spending a lot of time with him which i feel like i needed to slow down. 

This guy is very handsome, has businesses and owns his house on the other hand im just renting a unit. This kind of worries me a bit bec. we have a very different standpoint in life. He stays over in my place sometimes but my unit can be very hot and my cooler isnt the best, and lately he always asked me to come over to his place instead which im uncomfortable with. I am not the kind of woman who always drive to see the guy im dating, it doesnt sit right with my morals and upbringing! But then again my unit is very uncomfortable bec. the summer in australia is so bad. How can I communicate this with him without him thinking i am just making excuses? Like as a woman, how can you set your bounderies without killing the connection or the relationships that you both trying to build together?

Tbh, I have a good feeling about this guy, he remembers everything i tell him about me even the things i tell him about my friends and most times i even forget what i told him! He initiates 80% of our convos and he made sure our line of communication is not just through social medias, he knows all the ways how to reach me and vice versa. I so want to make this work by slowing things down but how? Thanks guys.

Now exclusive for about 4 months. By month 2 of dating he said his parents would be coming to town in another two months and he would like me to meet them. 

Relationship wise things were progressing nicely. Regular dates, frequent communication and we even took a trip abroad together which was lovely. However, we had a talk about 2 weeks ago and realized we weren't fully on the same page. I'm ready to settle down (not right away but if my relationship goes well I would say within a year), he's not. He's happy to be in a relationship but not ready for a long term commitment. This is somewhat confusing to me but that's his stance.


Following the convo, I asked for time to think and honestly, emotionally checked out. I was responsive to him when communicating but I wasn't initiating communication myself and just became preoccupied with my own life which is pretty full. Couple days ago he sent a message to essentially say he wants to talk about our relationship in person. I said let me know when. That didn't happen as yet. 

Fast forward, his parents are in town and he sent a message to say they have been asking about me. Ultimately, he said he wants me to join them for dinner.

datingoverthirty,10izb8h,1674434636.0,Navigating OLD when you live far away from a big city?,"Hi all! I've found myself in a bit of a quandary and am hoping to crowd-source some feedback here.

I live in a relatively rural part of a state that's about 90 mi/145 km (1.5 hours' driving time) from a very large, metropolitan city. Where I live the OLD scene is incredibly limited and quiet -- most folks are retirement-age or undergraduate students, with very few people in between. I'm currently essentially stuck here because of a difficult-to-land kind of job, and there's no chance within the next \~two years that I'll be able to up and move elsewhere to improve dating prospects.

To actually have some hope of meeting someone, I set my Hinge location to the big nearby city, with explicit text up front on my profile to explain that I don't physically live there. (Prompt of *The one thing you should know about me is*: ""I currently live out in \[rural area\] but am happy to meet up in \[big city\] and beyond!"") I really don't mind driving out to date someone -- I would hope eventually maybe they'd be willing to come out to visit me as well and it would balance out with time, but I'm happy to make the first connection(s) in the city. 

However, after reading some comments online, I'm worried that the very fact my location is inaccurate might come across as deceitful. I hoped I was being forthcoming enough with the bio text, because so long as someone reads my profile they're immediately aware. But what do you think? Is there something I can or should do differently?

(Additional context: I've heard of people from my area meeting their big city partners by driving out to the city and arranging like 3-4 first dates with different people on the same day üò® which sounds super stressful to me, but maybe is what's required?? It resulted in marriage for at least three people in this situation...)","As far as deceit goes it's not in the same ballpark as people who set their age to 30 and lead off their profile with, ""I'm actually 57"" or whatever.  That being said, people also set their range filters for a reason.  Depending on the city you live near, many might not even have the means to visit you.

I was/am in the same situation as you and I ended up turning to the internet to find love simply because OLD was a ghost town.  I did try to do the ""set my location to the big city"" thing but it mostly just ended up in meeting folks who had no patience for that sort of thing.  Why risk being disappointed by someone who lives 90 minutes away when they haven't run out of people who live 5 minutes away to be let down by.

Then again, I ended up meeting someone who lives like...8 hours away by plane and it's working wonderfully so there's hope for us semi-rural folks it would seem."

Knowing that they get along is a great feeling and really sends it home that I made the right choice in whom to love."

All around good guy. He‚Äôs taken me on some really awesome dates. I am really starting to like him a lot but I have a little bit of an issue I would like to approach him with but I don‚Äôt know how to say it. I don‚Äôt want to hurt his feelings at all. But I also know that like, I need to say it. 

In the bedroom, he‚Äôs doing some things that aren‚Äôt working out for me. And he‚Äôs done wayyyy too soon. . . 
How do I a) tell him not to do something a certain way because it doesn‚Äôt feel good, along with offering another way of doing it that I know is more enjoyable? And b) ask him in a nice way if he can hold out a little longer? 

This is embarrassing. Normally I would just suck it up and let it happen and be unsatisfied during the duration of the relationship but I‚Äôm realizing communication is really important for a solid and healthy relationship. 

Also I really like him a lot. I can see a future with him. But the sex is bumming me out.

ETA: wow thank you all so much for your advice I‚Äôm really grateful! I feel way less anxious about this conversation now.","Idk how long you two have been together, but any time I've been in a committed relationship with someone and they were direct and open about bedroom likes and dislikes that was the best way to learn my partners body, and the ways they enjoy mine. The key is knowing exactly what you do and don't like and why you do or don't like those things. A bruised ego will fade quickly once he develops a pride for being able to satisfy you.  Each person has very specific sexual habits, and it's a duty to learn and respect those habits. Simply sit him down, and lay it out for him. Tell him you want to develop deeper sexual relationship with him, but in order to do that he is going to have to be willing to change his sexual technique in order to achieve this deeper sexual relationship.  Good luck and enjoy."
datingoverthirty,10htx2w,1674315460.0,i did not even give a chance,"A person that I know exists for many years already (we live in a small town and our friend circles slighlty overlap) suddenly as I thought out of nowhere texted me asking if I am coming to an event (underground electronic music thing) the next day. I replied yes so he said he will try to find courage to talk to me. I was really flattered and excited even that I am not super attracted to him but I also do not know him at all and we have many things in common- he makes music that I really like, I enjoy the scene, I also make events and I make some noise music some times. 

I know that I would be really happy to be with someone who share this passion, because it often means doing things that most 30+ year olds will not accept or understand (late nights, loud music, noise etc.) And it is not easy to find someone especially in a small town like this.

So he came to me while I was on the dancefloor and barely even danced with me (that is not the place for talking - you either dance with me or if you reeaallly want to talk then okay we can go but everyone who understands the music also understands that dancing first is a much better chance to make a connection). He did not seem fully into that and was hanging around like 1 m behind me which I found super weird as I could not even see him and then after a while he just dissapeared. Fast forward couple hours later when he came and sat next to me, said he is leaving now. I said ohh okay good bye then (I was nice and smiling not being rude but also reserved as I was a bit high and also enjoying the music more than talking). And before he left he said: ""ok I just wanted to tell you that I like you, too!""

To which I just did not know how to respond at all I was just really surprised and I could not even think of anything that I did that would make him think I like him as I had not met him at all for 6 years or something. Maybe I have seen him but I do not pay that much of attention to random men and he is not the most memorable looking. I have liked his music though and I liked his post on facebook recently and added to an underground music facebook group haha (like few weeks before he wrote to me). 

Next morning he wrote to me again to ask when did I get home and apologized for not talking to me again and then after few more messages he said - see you next time! 
To which I just did not reply at all as I really could not understand what he is trying to do here.

Anyway- the comment of liking me, too and the whole interaction really made me feel like he does not like me that much but for some reason thought that I do so he decided to give ME a chance to go for him. Like why didn't he dance with me or did not ask me out or somehing if he likes me and feels bad that he did not talk to me? Am I too early to disregard his attempts of communication and is this how shy men try to 'play it cool'? I do not meet new people that often especially with similar interests so it feels a bit sad that I disliked him a bit even before actually meeting him but saying ""i like you, too"" like that is something i consider like actually really weird.

A long post about a short interaction but i do not have many of them so each is a significant one in my opinion.","You‚Äôre approaching this whole thing like you‚Äôre dating under 13. Like this is middle school level behavior from you. He‚Äôs at least trying although he seems super shy and inexperienced as well. I‚Äôll put him at like age 19-20 level. 

It‚Äôs really not this hard. You‚Äôre both adults. He‚Äôs expressed interest in you. You‚Äôve given him nothing to work with. Do you want to go on a date with him? Ask him if he wants to get a coffee or a drink sometime. 

You‚Äôre overthinking it. Don‚Äôt be embarrassed. Worst case scenario is you go on a few dates and realize you don‚Äôt vibe romantically. That‚Äôs ok. Then you can just go back to being friends/acquaintances and you both move on with life."

I‚Äôm pretty active here and sometimes I feel like I‚Äôm giving the same advice or seeing larger themes across posts. 

So, what‚Äôs your macro-advice, DOT? What do you think most people here could do differently to have more success dating?","As someone who reads all the posts that don't make it to the main page - so many people write stories of what they think is going on without fact checking them. Whether it's assuming they will be rejected for something that makes their quirky heart skip a beat, or because they are in the messy phase of improving their life, so many people find it safer to reject themselves before others can do so. Sometimes that shows up as being overly aggressive towards others or deeply picky and not just ""woe is me"". It sucks and I feel bad for all of them.  

Or they think there are hidden rules to make this process better, and desperately search for what to do so they ""do it right"" not realizing the limitations that brings. 

Also seeing people spending weeks or month messaging to try to learn everything about someone before having a date. You don't learn that through words alone, but through body language, facial expressions, behavior and other non-verbals. Go on the date, and make it a simple one so if it sucks you can leave and if it's great you can do more. 

Lastly, those who think being in a relationship will magically solve all their problems. That's how you get people who bounce from relationship to relationship after that ~3 month period when the NRE wears off. 

Any relationship that would be damaged by speaking up honestly about what you want and need isn't a relationship worth having."

datingoverthirty,10gjrcu,1674178780.0,Boyfriend too busy with arbitrary schedule. Makes it hard to plan anything.,"Tl;dr: Boyfriend too busy and works evenings and weekends. We live 1.5 miles from each other. His free time on weekends can be arbitrary depending on how much he got done that week. If I wait around like a doormat in the city we live in, I have more chances to see him. But this causes resentment in me as I can't plan my weekends easily. If I plan independent of his schedule, I don't see him even more (sometimes not at all for the whole week). Suggestions what to do?

My (34F) boyfriend (40M) is a lecturer. We've been officially together for 9 months (but prior to that, was in semi-dating status since Feb 2021). We live 1.5 miles to each other (close, but takes 30 mins walking). Weekdays we usually see each other 0-2 times, depending on his (very busy) schedule. I work 9-5 weekdays and leave work at work. He also works weekends. It's been like this since the new year and it will be this way the rest of the semester (until March).

My problem is: he usually has no idea how much free time he actually has for a particular weekend until the last minute. This means I can't really plan my weekends easily. This week he wasn't free to see me at all (today is Friday, we last saw each other briefly last Saturday). Today he told me that this weekend he has to work 'some'. From past experience, I know this can mean anything from only being able to have a quick dinner on Sat/Sun (worst case scenario), to being able to spend only half of Sat/Sun together (best case scenario).

Because of this, I've decided to plan my weekends as if he won't be free. But the problem is, that means I am guaranteed not to see him even more than if I had just waited around until he calls me to say ""I'm free now for the next 5 hours, want to meet up?"". I've done that (waited around) and it just made me feel like a doormat/like things are unfair. Out of semester time, he is still busier than most people but spend about 3 weekday evenings with me and most weekends (although he also travels a lot, out of semester).

I don't want to pressure him to somehow do something (I don't think it's fair since his job is important), but I also feel like if we don't spend time together I am starting to feel disconnected, and yet if I don't just live my life and plan independent of his schedule, I would build resentment. Don't really know what to do, appreciate insights/advice.","This sounds like an unsustainable system. I would recommend bringing it up in a compassionate yet honest way.

If he doesn‚Äôt want to/can‚Äôt, that‚Äôs fine, that‚Äôs his prerogative, but then you have to make a decision on if it‚Äôs something you‚Äôre willing to live with. To me I wouldn‚Äôt be happy with the inconsistency and last-minuteness, but that‚Äôs just me"

But, talk some sense into me....

I want more (text)communication but I don't want to explicitly say that because, the only thing worse than extremely minimal text(barely 1-2 times, every other day) is them only doing it because I told them to.

I think I've realized I equate number of texts to how often they think of me ....thus revealing how much they value me and our relationship.. which I logically understand isn't necessarily true. But obviously I'm having trouble shaking it.

So say something?
Or just accept we have different expectations in this area and decide to either stay or leave.

I expect someone to toss the ball back in somewhat equal measure - if they run away with the ball and I constantly have to chase them to get it back? I'm going to find someone else to play catch with...

While I get that it feels like you‚Äôre asking for something, at the end of the day it either works for you or it doesn‚Äôt.

If it doesn‚Äôt? You need to have a conversation about it. Don‚Äôt ever feel badly about what you want or need, but do make sure it‚Äôs not an unreasonable expectation.

That also being said? You‚Äôve drawn a really bad conclusion about text frequency being joined to how they feel or how often they think about you.

datingoverthirty,10fonpx,1674091697.0,Guys - would you date someone who was pregnant?,"I am a F (39) who became pregnant in my last relationship (birth control failure). Roe vs Wade was overturned about a week before I found out, though I really don't know what I would have chosen. Irregardless, that relationship has ended, and I am ready to enter the dating scene again. I'm not getting any younger, after all! And admittedly it would be nice to not go through it alone. I just don't know if there's any point in putting myself out there while I'm still pregnant... should I wait until after the baby is born and recovery is finished? Or would you date a woman who was already pregnant when you met? Any advice or feedback is much appreciated!

For info, I just started my last trimester (with a boy) if it's relevant, and I have 3 older children from a previous marriage F(15), F(13), and F(5). So I would obviously only be dating someone who was ok with children in the first place.

Edited for clarity: when I say I don't want to go it alone, I mean I want a romantic companion. I am NOT l looking for support for the pregnancy/ newborn. The fathers are active and get visitation, and the baby will be coparented between our homes (moreso after the newborn stage). Likely, any new partner would not even meet my kids for a while. I would want to take my time getting to know them without kids involved first, and it wouldn't be fair to them or the children to make introductions unless I knew it had potential to go somewhere. I am not looking for a replacement father, but if a relationship worked out they would obviously have to be ok with kids, as that would be an important factor in the future. I am mostly curious if men would consider dating a woman during that pregnancy stage or should I wait until after to start meeting people. I would not make a new relationship partner help take care of my newborn, that would be absurd.

Edit 2: I thoroughly appreciate everyone's honesty! Truly! I think I've been letting the loneliness (and maybe hormones) cloud my judgements, but you guys have certainly brought me back to reality. I think dating is just not feasible right now in my life, and I should definitely wait. I'm sure once the baby is here I'll have plenty of new love and stay plenty busy as well. Thank you all for being truthful, I actually really needed that.","I‚Äôm a woman who dates men so take my thoughts with a grain of salt, but the fact that you say ‚Äúit would be nice to not go through [pregnancy] alone‚Äù is not a great reason to date. I wouldn‚Äôt want to date someone who‚Äôs using me as a crutch to get through something incredibly demanding and important.

datingoverthirty,10fm17c,1674084848.0,How do you force yourself to care enough about dating to continue to put forth effort?,"At 38, I've realized I just don't really care to continue trying to date and I just wonder who else is in the same boat, or how did you overcome such lack of desire?","In contrast to a lot of the other comments here: I get it.  You want a comfortable relationship with someone you love, but the prospect of going out and finding that through dating isn‚Äôt easy.   Being 38 and having the clock ticking doesn‚Äôt help either.  The conventional advice is to not think about your age, if you don‚Äôt want to date then don‚Äôt, and that your person will just come out when you stop looking. 

Allow me to offer a pragmatic take.  Yes the clock is ticking, if you want to meet your person you‚Äôre going to have to overcome your anxieties and put in the hard work to get an attractive and confident version of yourself out there.  The magic trick you have to learn is to realize these pragmatic truths, but don‚Äôt allow yourself to be further driven into anxiety or depression by how daunting they seem and are. RELAX!

Maybe that doesn‚Äôt help you, but that‚Äôs how I feel a lot of the time about dating and forming new relationships.  Not everyone has an easy time dating and meeting new people, but we should all be able to find our person if companionship is what we want and we put in the effort."

datingoverthirty,10fq4xg,1674095830.0,Dating with alopecia,"Hello hello reddit,

I have had alopecia for the last ten years - I have a severe form in which I have lost all of the hair on my body (although some of my hair on my head is coming back in!).

I usually spend my days wig-free, but have had no success with online dating over the past two years... so yesterday I decided to make a new profile on a new app, but only with me wearing my wig. 50+ likes and 5 comments in less than 12 hours which is so, so much more attention than I've gotten in the last two years. 

Wearing a wig makes me feel better. It improves my self-confidence and self-esteem. It makes me feel like when I meet a guy, he's getting to know me for *me.* When I meet someone wig-free, people think I'm *alternative.* Or, that I'm sick (cancer). Or that I'm super sexually outgoing (no sir, I do not want to have a threesome), or that I'm just looking for a hookup - when all I've ever looked for is a long-term partner. I've been asked if I'm Buddhist (I'm not) and if I'm Jewish (nope). Baldness seems to attract a certain type of guy to me, and it's certainly *not* the boy-next-door kind of guy I'm looking for.

Friends, how do I navigate this in online dating? Do I go on a few dates with someone until I get to know them, and then tell them I have alopecia and remove my wig? Do I tell them on the first date? Do I mention it in my dating profile?

It's hard because I normally *don't* wear a wig. But while I'm very confident, being bald destroys my self-confidence in dating because I don't feel attractive. So while I can totally meet a guy wearing a wig, I would have to tell him the instant we start to do anything sexual, and you guys can imagine how much of a sexual shock it is to go from seeing someone with a full head of hair, to them bald.

I posted this in the sticky but I‚Äôm really really hurting bad and I wanted to make a bigger post‚Ä¶ At the moment I‚Äôm pretty proud of myself that I sent the conversation in a direction that lead to us breaking up. With my co-dependent nature it could have gone a different way, but I guess I did learn something in therapy and in life, because when he confessed his doubts I instantly felt all safety that I had with him evaporate and I was like Get this dude out of here now. It was touch and go in our second conversation today, if he‚Äôd maybe hinted at trying again I might have jumped at that but I know last night I was telling myself like No, you can‚Äôt put yourself through the insecurity of being with someone who has doubts, even if he wants to keep trying. So I stuck to it but it hurts like hell. For two months there we really seemed insanely in love, but based on actual compatibilities, values, long long conversations. So now it‚Äôs back to my depression that had already been brewing for a few weeks, my regular scheduled winter sadness. 


I just broke up with my boyfriend of 3 months. Predictable story of separated man thinks he‚Äôs ready but oh wait, he isn‚Äôt ready. He said he was having doubts, I said well I have to protect myself now, and we went from there, in two conversations yesterday and today. It hurts like hell. But it would have been extremely difficult, his divorce is a mess and he has 3 kids below 10. Still hurts. We said I love you and everything. He said he really thought he could do it, and that he saw a future with me, but as we progressed it just got more difficult and he was always so gloomy and needy. It‚Äôll take a while to get over this one, compatibility was off the charts.

1,5 years separated, but he and his ex-wife were bird-nesting, which means the children stay in the house and the parents are in the house on alternate weeks. And they were disagreeing about a lot of things in their settlement, it was going to be a really heavy divorce and the ex sounded pretty high-conflict. He was always going on about the ‚Äútrauma‚Äù of being in a pretty controlling relationship, although I do know that was only his side of the story. In a way I do feel somewhat relieved to be spared all that and all his gloominess about the divorce, but I know I would have done it gladly if it meant we would come out at the end of it, stable and still together. But even before these doubts emerged I was unsure, like what if he‚Äôll just use me as a comfort blanket throughout his divorce and then toss me. He ended up tossing me much sooner.","I'll keep this brief; it's never a good idea to get involved with, or date a person that is separated, and not (finally) divorced. ""Separated"" means that they are NOT completely available. They are NOT fully available emotionally, psychologically, and often ""physically"" as well."
datingoverthirty,10fkswu,1674081873.0,Should I bring it up or let it go?,"So..I (30F) dated him (30M) briefly. Right after he had asked me to be his girlfriend, he had to move for work. He had moved to my state during the pandemic because his work was remote. Then he got the notice that his office was requiring everyone to go back to the office. I decided that it was best for us to stop seeing each other because the relationship was quite new and I didn't think it would work long distance. Now, we would still see each other (once a month ) during the year he moved out of state because he frequently came back and I have been to his apartment in the other state twice. He moved back to my state last month and we just naturally started seeing each other again.

 Now here's what's bothering me...we started talking about us and he said that his issue with me is that I don't want to have kids. But that's not a secret, I make sure to tell the guy beforehand because I don't want to waste their time. I guess he told me this because he wants to make sure I am aware that he's not serious about me.  This is a guy who asked me to be his girlfriend and he knew from the start I didn't want kids. I am not mad that he doesn't want to be with me because of that, I just feel like he wasted my time from the beginning. I had assumed that he was okay with the no kids thing because he kept dating me. 

I am not sure if I should ask why he dated me back then (if he wanted kids) or just swallow my words since there's no chance for a relationship anyways?",[deleted]
datingoverthirty,10fdlzk,1674063974.0,How do you get past a new date reminding you of your ex?,"So I had a meet up with this guy a couple days ago. He‚Äôs perfectly nice and no red flags that I saw. I was just suddenly reminded on my ex when we met in person though. I wasn‚Äôt reminded of any negative qualities. Whether it was his appearance or how he behaved, etc. I was just reminded of my ex. And remembering my ex made me feel uncomfortable. My ex and I were together for 8 years, been apart for a little over 2. I haven‚Äôt felt this way with other dates. And I don‚Äôt want to judge this guy based on a feeling I have when he has done nothing to receive any fault. I never think of my ex aside from when he randomly messages me or in this occasion. So I‚Äôm wondering how does one get past this? I know this is a personal issue I have to work through I‚Äôm just not sure how. Any advice?","So I‚Äôve been on the receiving end of a ‚ÄúI had a really great time but you reminded me so much of my ex that we shouldn‚Äôt see each other again.‚Äù

Abstractly? I‚Äôd personally give it a second. Maybe it‚Äôs just an impression which gives way to appreciating how he‚Äôs different!

Or maybe it gets reinforced as ‚Äúhe‚Äôs my ex in a different meat suit, EW!‚Äù

In this world, everyone is different. We all have different experiences and things that set us apart. Though we also may have things that remind others of someone else.

datingoverthirty,10f1xw4,1674029319.0,Do you use any methodical approaches to dating?,"So, I have people pleaser tendencies that have led to me being strung along or hurt in the past. And I suppose my overall approach to dating is just meeting people, see how we get on, see how things progress, etc.

But lately I‚Äôve been feeling that I could perhaps benefit from a more methodical approach to dating to avoid falling into the same situations again.

Perhaps this could be setting some rules and sticking to them. For example, I‚Äôve been strung along by someone who took forever to reply to messages before, so I could set a rule not to entertain guys who take more than 24 hours to respond.

Or perhaps this could look like a checklist, spreadsheet, I don‚Äôt know.

Just curious to hear about any such approaches people take in their dating. I guess just any sort of logical framework that helps you take a rational approach rather than being led astray by emotions.","Know the difference between ""dealbreakers"" and ""nice to haves."" 

Be specific when you're looking for **qualities** and **values.** For example, people will say, ""I want my partner to read books"" when it's possible that it's not so much the reading of books that's important, but rather them being curious about the world."

I do a lot of filtering out in early dating, but if I've made it that far, I'm usually pretty excited, which means I'm always the one getting dumped at that stage.

I guess it's a good thing that I'm emotionally opening up. Sure makes it hurt more, though. I would never want to convince them to stay, but I can't help feeling sad about the potential that I saw. It's hard to tell if I should do anything different."
datingoverthirty,10etzks,1674005122.0,"Love, Emotional Roller-coasters, Second Chances, and Where Do We Go From Here??","A woman (31F) I've (35M) known for a long time and me had a casual but intimate relationship for around a year (friends turned to lovers).  She wanted to get more serious, but due to me being afraid to commit, and basically taking her for granted I turned her down and she quickly met someone else.  I immediately regretted my decision and expressed that regret to her, even before I learned she met the new guy, but it was too late at that point, she was frustrated and determined to move on, or punish me, or whatever.  Over the last 6 months we've had many near misses of reconnecting while she was seeing this other guy.  It was an emotional roller coaster of her getting somewhat close to me, but then ultimately not committing, and me getting angry and saying things I now regret.  We did that cycle multiple times.  I could tell she still loved me, and I wanted to reconnect, but she had feelings for the new guy and reservations about me.  She said on multiple occasions that she loved both me and the other guy.  It was a really unhealthy situation where I think she didn't want to let go of me completely, and I wanted to get back together.  So, she totally enabled the worst emotions in me of jealousy and anger.

Now her and the other guy have split up, but I made the mistake of misjudging where they were at, because she totally kept me in the dark about what was going on between them.  We had been getting somewhat close again, but ultimately I got fed up, angry, and basically told her off and said I wanted nothing to do with her anymore and I was sick and tired of being strung along while she was with someone else.  Horrible timing, this was right around when they split up.

I really love this person and desperately want to give it another chance.  We've talked a limited amount since all the drama, and I expressed that I was just emotional and didn't mean what I said.  She told me that she's hurt and just needs space right now.  I can totally respect that, and give her the space; but the irrational side of me is scared that I'll lose her and I'm dying for some reassurance that we have a second chance out there.  There's a lot of built up resentment we both hold over the messy situation we've been in for the past few months, and I think doubt on her side, some on my side too.  I know I just need to give things space right now and let her come to me, but I just can't stop thinking about her.  I've had a couple short flings with other people during the past few months and both of them I just was thinking about how I wish I was with her.  It's like I can't even date someone else or move on.

Besides just giving it time and seeing whether we can reconnect slowly, does anyone have advice on how to progress here? or what not to do?  I really want to reach out, but I know I need to respect her desire for space, and I don't want to turn her off any more than I already have by getting too emotional.  Is this even worth giving another chance after we've both been so unfair to each other?  

I know that my description of the situation is a lot to unpack, because it's genuinely complicated af.  So I'll be happy to clarify or add any details.","Seems pretty simple, you fucked up and you should move on and let this woman go. Take some time off from dating and sort your shit out so that you don‚Äôt fuck up things up the next time you meet someone as well. 

There is nothing complicated here, you are just trying to find a way to avoid taking responsibility for all the ways you screwed yourself here.

If you aren‚Äôt ready to commit to a relationship that is fine, but be honest with yourself and with your dating partners about that. Then you can avoid all this needless drama. If you do want a relationship, then you have to be ready to commit when the time comes. If you aren‚Äôt ready when they are, then you have to let them go, not do this unfair commitment dance you did with this woman. 

And you telling her off because she was stringing you along, WHILE SHE WAS IN A RELATIONSHIP WITH ANOTHER MAN, wasn‚Äôt horrible timing. It was just you being a horrible person. She was in a relationship with another man, she wasn‚Äôt stringing you along, you were stringing yourself along."

datingoverthirty,10eq53e,1673995602.0,How many failed almost-relationships (more than 4 dates but no exclusive relationship) have you been through?,"Just trying to give myself some reassurance that this is all normal.

Went on dates with 5 people, the fifth led to a 3-month situationship that went nowhere. A few more dates, then a 6-month relationship which ended due to incompatibility. Then dates with 20-25 guys last year. Among those, there were four guys that made it past date 4. One I ended, one he ended, two ended mutually.

I'm used to bad first/second dates. But in total, across a year and a half of active dating it feels like I've had six or so things getting past the month mark and feeling like ""maybe this could work, oh, nope"". Is that normal? I want a monogamous LTR and kids, and I date people that say they have the same goals. 

How many of these short-ish one to three month ""maybe this could work"" things did you go through before finding something that worked out? I know it's ultimately random and I have little control over these things. But, it feels the number of people I've gone on a date with doesn't take a toll nearly as much as the number of these ""maybe...?"" things.","Too many.

Dating is what you put into it. If you‚Äôre having that many bad first dates than you need to evaluate what you‚Äôre doing ahead of time I feel or what you‚Äôre bringing to the date.

datingoverthirty,10eitqq,1673978625.0,Being okay with hurting people,"Context: 30, online dating since I was 27 with a few 2-3 month relationships and about a zillion first/second/third dates. Big feeler and extremely sensitive to not wanting to hurt people. For examples, when I first started online dating I would torture myself over crafting the kindest rejection text after one date. One time I even cried! I'm more comfortable with that now, but still feel like shit when rejecting people.

I find that my desire to not hurt people almost guarantees that I end up hurting them. Many many times, I'm dating someone and see something that is not a problem now but could be a problem in 10 years (e.g. he is perfect and sweet and wonderful but his jokes are kind of corny and maybe I'll get sick of them somewhere down the line). Therefore, instead of being open and seeing where things go, I break it off because I'd rather hurt him now than in a year. I realize this is \*not\* a good strategy, but it's what's automatic for me and therefore I am seeking your input/thoughts!

Does anyone else relate to this? Or, if you don't relate to this, can you offer your reaction? Just curious how other people approach balancing not wanting to hurt people or waste their time, with actually giving people a chance and having an open heart. Also open to people telling me to just suck it up and get over myself (honestly would welcome this lol).

Even sent me a link for an application to work a job similar to hers. Said she would help me. I know this isn‚Äôt right it just feels so wrong. I would‚Äôve loved if this ‚Äúambition‚Äù thing came up earlier. It only came up a couple of days ago once I was attached. I don‚Äôt know what that says about me, being attached and not seeing things. I‚Äôve been dating the last couple of years and have avoided red flags fairly well. We just got along so well before that and was basically love bombing me without saying it a week or two before all of this. She knew what I did for a living since we first met. I told her what my cap paid and that I could get there fairly quickly, and she said she‚Äôd ‚Äútotally be okay with that‚Äù. Apparently not. 

She claims even if I applied to her job and other jobs that I would show drive and that she‚Äôd never resent me to for trying and failing. Maybe after that she would ask how high I can jump? The craziest part is I considered it. That maybe I could get an even better job AND keep her. It just feels so wrong to do that. I know I need to just bow out, call off the Friday night date and just wish her luck. It‚Äôs just really hard to consider right now even though I know that‚Äôs what I will do. Maybe tomorrow so she has time to plan some other weekend plans. Thank you for the many replies i didn‚Äôt expect so many. 

38/m have been dating 35/f for a month now. There‚Äôs been five dates. Long story short, things have been great. Plenty of communication and our communication styles seem to match. It seems fast but I was actually invited to a dinner at her parents house and had a good time, she says her folks really liked me. She has one son, a baby. 9 months old. She has been single about 6 months and dad is seemingly from her and her family, really not all that interested in him yet sees him  a little each week. He also lives 2 hours away, since they split he moved in with his parents who love that far away. She says I‚Äôm the first person she‚Äôs dated since then.

Obviously, since I took the dinner, I‚Äôm very interested in her. It‚Äôs been refreshing to not play games or think they‚Äôre being played. That being said, we were talking on the phone Saturday night and I mentioned being interested in dating exclusively and asked how she felt about that. She went on about how comfortable she is with me, that she feels often that we‚Äôre the same person. That her family liked me and that I‚Äôm so great with her son. She then expressed that her only pause that she‚Äôs trying to shake is that she fears that my career drive isn‚Äôt the same as hers. She has a better job than I do l, for sure. But I work full time, own my own house and pay all my bills. I‚Äôm self sufficient, not to mention when she gets child support, surely it would be significant, since her ex makes 100k a year. It wasn‚Äôt mentioned beyond all the nice words and this possible dealbreaker on her end. That obviously wasn‚Äôt a yes, which to me, makes it a no. 

That stung quite a bit. I haven‚Äôt brought it up the last couple days. She says she hasn‚Äôt gone on any dates since our first one. I‚Äôd like to believe that, with a toddler and very little help, her free time outside of when we‚Äôve been together, has to be scarce. I saw her Sunday and she suggested plans this Friday night at her place. She‚Äôs actually been the one to suggest the next date the last couple of times. Texting and communication is still the same as when before I asked about exclusivity. Almost like it never happened. I‚Äôve been taking a l small step back in things, we have a date this Friday, so there‚Äôs that. My texting probably has been a little different, since I think some defensive walls are coming up figuratively for me. It‚Äôs hard to put an idea like that that seems harmless and simple and not getting the answer you‚Äôd like. Definitely a blow to my confidence with her.

She texted me after I got off work today, asking ‚Äúdid I do something?‚Äù And that ‚ÄúI seem a bit silent‚Äù. We did talk on my lunch break and a little before work, so definitely not silent. Maybe different. Does she really not see or is oblivious to the fact that it was a rejection and that could cause someone to reassess their place with someone? 

I don‚Äôt know if I should say that since she asked, that the rejection did sting but that I wasn‚Äôt intentionally talking less throughout the day, or stay the course and keep it somewhat minimal as I did today? I think it‚Äôs weird that she wouldn‚Äôt put two and two together on that one.",Five dates and you've met her family? She has a baby and only six months since she split with the dad?

Let me preface this by saying, I appreciate women who know what they want.

At the same time, I've noticed lately I've matched with a few women who just cut straight to the chase of more ""serious"" questions, and I find that a bit of a turnoff too.  Like, lets have a bit of banter back and forth before just jumping into the meaty stuff.  If we match, lets chat about our day, or what we do for fun, or something before going straight to ""do you have kids?"", ""have you been married"", ""what are your intentions in dating"".    I don't want 3 weeks of idle chit chat, but I don't think it needs to be done by the 3rd message either.

I think to me, it almost comes across too transactional, as opposed to genuinely getting to know me to see if there is a connection.  Its like they have a list that they are checking off before even meeting in person.   It would be like going into a job interview and not even exchanging pleasantries before just jumping into ""So why do you want to work here"".

But, I'd be interested in hearing other people's thoughts on this.

Edit:  For those acting like I'm an idiot, I DO have on my profile that I don't have kids.  It doesn't stop people from asking.  I also have on my hinge profile that I'm looking for LTR, open to short.  So again, its not like I'm hiding anything in my profile.",I wish more people would get straight to the point.

So quick context: I (34F) match with guy (37M) on bumble. I swiped right on him over the holidays while he was in my town visiting his family, and he matched with me *after* he flew back home (side bar: what's up with that? was he just bored?). We quickly got along: weird, dry humor; mutual attraction; nerdy, etc.... we moved to texting off the app, which I initiated because bumble notifications suck, and we were messaging back and forth a lot. We sent pictures and got to know each other over text. 

I'm not one to beat around the bush, so after about 3 weeks of this, I ask him (not rhetorically) what he thinks is going on here. He replies, ""I have no expectations. It's fun to text but I like talking to you."" <--- WTF DOES THAT MEAN?!

Then about a week ago, the texting kind of faded out and I called him out on it and he said he's just been busy but was definitely still interested. If we lived in the same town, we most likely would've already gone out and then be planning our next date or have gone our separate ways. I'm at the point where I'm done just texting and want to move on to the next phase, but how do we do that if we can't go on a date? I've hinted at him calling me by saying: it'd be nice to talk to him on the phone, and I wonder what his voice sounds like. His response to that was: ""wouldn't it be funny if I sounded like a mouse?"" Ughhh. Lol. I did tell him I don't like the inconsistency of his replies and he apologized and said he would try to do better at communicating, but he hasn't really changed his behavior.

datingoverthirty,10danwl,1673862887.0,"He is not taking me seriously, right?","Edit: thanks all for the comments. I teared up a little lol. Dating has been so hard. I wanted to give it up so many times. Anyway I think you‚Äôre all right. Thanks for being my sounding board. A bit more context - 
1. When my therapist and I were digging into possible reasons why I haven‚Äôt had a single meaningful relationship for the past 4 or so years, she suggested maybe I focus too much on finding red flags than trying to find one good thing about a person. I thought she had a point, because man, I‚Äôve had more than enough first dates (50<n<100), but very few of them were ‚Äòmy type‚Äô. I don‚Äôt develop feelings easily anyway, and my attempts in ‚Äútaking time to get to know someone without being romantic/intimate‚Äù have always failed - either by 1) guys ghosting me first or 2) guys not seeing this developing into something romantic. As long as I have been single, I didn‚Äôt have sex for almost 3 years. I have cut off guys before I got intimate. So I guess this time I was trying something totally different from what I would normally do, but you are right that I shouldn‚Äôt let myself to be abused. 

2. Totally agree with the communication part as well - it definitely is what I‚Äôm not good at. I‚Äôm not good at speaking my needs, not just in romantic relationships but also in friendships too. I will take this as an opportunity to practice, and talk about how I felt and what I wanted clearly when I cut him off.

3. This is my first time learning the term ‚Äòneurodivergent‚Äô. There actually are so so many guys with some sort of social disorders in my industry - I‚Äôve met countless insecure guys and potentially AS, too, and how careless of me having let this one slide, just because he had many ‚Äúfriends‚Äù. Maybe I should try dating out of my industry.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

F here. While I have had a lot first dates, I haven‚Äôt had a serious relationship for a long time (3-4 years). In most cases so far, if I (or a guy) felt like this wasn‚Äôt going to work out, I cut things off within 3rd or 4th date. Then my therapist told me, maybe I‚Äôm avoidant and should try to be more lenient - and try taking more time than being too judgmental in the early stage.

So this guy I‚Äôve been dating for about a month now‚Ä¶ We are both in our early 30s and met on OLD. He did not give me a good impression on our first date. We met for coffee, and he didn‚Äôt seem interested in me e.g. not making an eye contact, not asking questions about me, only answering to questions I ask, etc. So I totally assumed he was not interested in me at all, and didn‚Äôt even wait for a text.

So I was very surprised when he reached out a couple days later and asked to hang out again. I told him I had other plans, but he waited and asked me out again 2 weeks later. So I was like ‚ÄòI‚Äôll give it a try‚Äô, and went for the second date, which turned out to be better than the first date. I still had to ask him a lot of questions because he wouldn‚Äôt talk much, but maybe because he was drinking, he was a bit more talkative and I actually had some fun. So we made out a little.

It‚Äôs the third date when I started to feel something was off. We cooked together at his place and got intimate. I was so surprised when, after we had sex, there was no pillow talk. No pillow talk at all - I have dated a fair number of guys and he was the first guy who didn‚Äôt have any pillow talk. What‚Äôs more, usually after having sex, a guy would suggest taking a shower together, or taking a nap together, etc., but this guy‚Ä¶ after a little while, he got up silently without talking to me, got dressed again, and started hanging out on his own in the living room.

It was a totally different vibe compared to before having sex. I felt so awkward - like I wasn‚Äôt sure what I was supposed to do. Felt like an uninvited guest. But because I had somewhere else to go afterwards, I left his place anyway and he gave me a ride. 

I didn‚Äôt feel great after the 3rd date. I noticed he didn‚Äôt text as much after the 3rd date, and his replies got shorter. I wanted to end things here, but reminded myself of what my therapist told me, and convinced myself that maybe there was not enough evidence to end things already.

Then he asked me out for a 4th date. He does come with plans but he only reaches out at the last minute [removed details]

I found out more red flags about him on the 4th date:
- He never asks me how my day/week went. He rarely asks any questions about me (persistent since the 1st date).
- I ask him questions and his answers are extremely short, and he doesn‚Äôt want to elaborate. e.g. Do you like X? ‚ÄòNo.‚Äô Why not? ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt know.‚Äô I get frustrated, the conversation stops there and, silence. He only occasionally talks/asks about topics of his interests.
- He doesn‚Äôt remember what I told him before. e.g. I will be away for 4 weeks and he didn‚Äôt remember that it was a long trip. And even after he was reminded, simply told me to ‚Äúhave fun‚Äù and that was it. He didn‚Äôt care.
- He gets carried away easily and seems to live in his own world. [removed details]
- When we went to his place again, his behavior was the same - being cuddly until sex, but after sex, doing his own thing without inviting me. When I joined him, he left me again to do something on his own. He didn‚Äôt even ask me if I wanted to sleep over. I was going to leave anyway, but felt like I was being kicked out. 
- The fact that he‚Äôs making me overthink and write this lengthy post.

I think these are enough red flags that he is not compatible and not taking me seriously. At first, I was making excuses for him that maybe he‚Äôs socially awkward or maybe he‚Äôs nervous - but he has many friends that he loves who plan trips with all the time. If this is the way he is, don‚Äôt want to try to fix him - don‚Äôt want to date a broken guy.

I wanted to get your opinions to make sure that, this time I‚Äôm not prematurely ending things. What do you think? It seems like I can never find good quality men on OLD.","Nothing in your post indicates you're into him at all. It feels like you took your therapist's advice of being more lenient too far. There's a middle ground where you give people a bit more of a chance, but can still cut things off that clearly aren't going to work."
datingoverthirty,10d55bi,1673843780.0,"I (35F) love him (40M), but‚Ä¶","Painting the picture:   

I‚Äôm 35F with no children, my partner is 40M with one 4yo child.

I grew up very poor, no advantages in life, and  worked very hard to reach my current career where I make anywhere between 120-150k incl commission. This is the first job where I have made enough to not live paycheck to paycheck, and for the first time in my life I feel like I can ‚Äúbreathe‚Äù (ie I have no debt, bills are paid on time, credit is good, I have money saved for a rainy day and I‚Äôm investing).   

My partner grew up in a gated community with a silver spoon and has always been taken care of, and I feel this has impacted his overall ambition and drive. 

He has bounced around between jobs making anywhere from $22-$26 per hour. Because this is not enough to match his current expenses, his other supplements his income (he shared with me that he has a ‚Äòtrust fund‚Äô but in fact he just has a mom who e-transfers him anywhere from $1,000 to $5,000 each month as he needs). Last year I believe she gave him roughly 30k üò±.   


I am with this man because he has the largest heart I have ever known. He is gentle, kind, compassionate, patient, understand, communicative, thoughtful, romantic and non reactive. If I am the river, he is the rock.   

After a few months of dating initially (we‚Äôve been together about 8 months now), I broke up with him. He was working a shitty job that required him to travel for up to a week at a time - often with little notice - and paid him $22 per hour for hours worked on site. This meant every evening spent in shitty hotel rooms was unpaid time that he was sacrificing from his child. His kid never knew when dad would or would not be around and it had a big impact on him. 

As someone who wants a child of my own, this was alarming to me. The cost was too high for such little gain.   

My partner hated this job and would often complain, but wouldn‚Äôt take any action at all. To make matters worse, if it was his week to have his child as part of his 50/50 custody agreement and he happened to be travelling, his mother (the one supplementing his income) would come stay at his home and care for his child (the child‚Äôs mother did not want the extra time with her child - she‚Äôs a real gem).  At one point my partner was in a car accident, and was injured enough that he had some time off work. Rather than using any of this time to look for a new opportunity, he wasted the days away playing video games all day.   

When he went to replace his vehicle after the accident, he asked to borrow the $1,000 down payment from me. Alarm bells went off that this man was signing for a vehicle that would cost $700 per month (a brand new Acura MDX) yet he did not have $1,000 in the bank.   

I lent him the money, and then broke up with him. 40 years old, no money saved, no drive or ambition to want more, all while having a child to support‚Ä¶ I was out.    


However‚Ä¶ a few months later we reconnected. He had lost 40lbs on a new strict gym regimen, was taking great care of himself, his son was in a new school and they had been following a new routine at home (it was the wild Wild West when I was around last), he had been regularly seeing a therapist since our breakup, had been journalling and reflecting daily, and he had started a new job that he was loving where there was opportunity for growth - and he had already got a raise!   

I remembered how much I adored this man for all of his wonderful qualities and could see that he had seen tremendous growth which he seemed committed to. I got back together with him.   

Fast forward four months and the relationship is going wonderful. We are having the time of our lives together, seemingly communicating well and openly, and I‚Äôve developed a wonderful relationship with his family. 

Then, after a long Christmas break of us being lazy and him playing video games all day for a week (no hate, everyone needs to unplug for time to time), he tells me he is jobless. Why? Because just before the Christmas break guys at work were talking (he was doing Reno‚Äôs) and apparently the owner of the company had been collecting deposits on jobs to make payroll, but wasn‚Äôt finishing projects. Customers were pissed and it was clear (so they say) that their jobs were on the line. So they all jumped ship.   

My partner started reaching out to the companies he had applied to when securing this job, and met someone for coffee to discuss a job opportunity. He was told they could have work for him in a week. However a week later, after he had already quit his job, they told him they actually can‚Äôt take him on until mid February.   

My issue is this: My partner has been talking to me about getting engaged, moving in together, even about when we would start trying for a baby. Yet, he did all of this with no communication to me whatsoever. He quit his job without even talking to me. If we were already living together, or better yet had already had a baby, and this happened‚Ä¶ I would be financially responsible for myself, a 40 year old man, his child and our baby!  

I do not feel okay about this, and as this all seems to feel very familiar I am reflecting on what has been consistent since we got back together. And really, it‚Äôs nothing. He doesn‚Äôt go to the gym anymore, he has not seen his therapist since we got back together, his child is running amuck again with no structure, and now he has no job - and still has nothing saved, still carrying his debt, but still driving his brand new Acura.    

I am 36. I‚Äôve worked hard to get to a place where I am ready for the next steps with the right person - ie marriage, engagement, children. I have my shit together and I am financially and otherwise independently. I am terrified that if I partner with this person I will wind up financially responsible for them - just like their mother is Joe. I do not want to fill her shoes.  I want and deserve a partner I can rely on, who can be an equal. This does not have to be to the dollar, but a consistent job and income that they are committed to and responsible with.   

All of this to ask‚Ä¶ am I just fitting a square peg into a round whole? Am I just driving us both towards a resentment?  On the other hand ‚Ä¶ what if I spend the rest of my life searching for all of his wonderful qualities?   

I‚Äôm 36, I‚Äôm in the last fertile window I have if I want a child of my own, and I am both terrified of wasting time while also terrified of losing a great love.   

Help! What would you do????","I didn't read all that. Turns out I didn't need to. 

You move on. There are guys out there that are going to have more ambition. My guess is you aren't even asking for a ton, just someone who is roughly as motivated as you to be financially secure. They exist. Don't settle for this guy. If you are going to be financially responsible for yourself and three children (let's be square, he's still a child), why not just go to it alone and be responsible for yourself and one child? It would be foolish to expect he is going to be much of a help when it comes to raising your child anyway."

datingoverthirty,10d1eqs,1673832878.0,Profile Review: 34M - Values or Interests?,"I was curious as to how others go about crafting their profile to be more than the pictures that represent them. I believe common values are important to developing a lasting relationship and I tried to convey that message. Things like generosity, courtesy, intelligence, kindness, and overall happiness are important to me in a partner but only discovered through witnessed actions while getting to know someone better. So I focused on the following: financial habits, interpersonal relationships, and environmentalism. I screen for drug use, prospective partners with children, excessive religiosity and extreme political views. These are things I will not compromise on. I think something like 1/3 of single women my age already have children and I wonder sometimes whether I should compromise on this point. I've been through the ringer with training (recently finished) and I would like to share adventures with a future partner before children enter the mix. 

&#x200B;

However, making a connection with someone new over values is much more difficult than bonding over common interests. It's much easier to foster a new relationship over a shared hobby or musical preferences. I infrequently get matches (Date 0 with someone new every couple months). I figure my profile is may be off putting to some and I screen pretty heavily up front. The people I have met have been great but things didn't work out for one reason or another. My interests include: art and fashion as a form of self expression, reading, hiking, rock climbing, listening to the symphony, playing word games (Boggle, Scrabble, Wordle) and discussing philosophy. I would love to meet someone who likes to play Magic the Gathering (lol). None of the above is a requirement which is why I focused on common values. It's rare to come across a flushed out profile (interests or otherwise).

datingoverthirty,10ctb33,1673812897.0,Emotionally distant and struggling to provide emotional support to my partner,"Hello datingoverthirty, 

I keep getting into arguments with my girlfriend over what she tells me is my lack of emotional support for her. She's an anxious attachment, depressed. I'm an avoidant attachment and also depressed. 

I grew up in a household with emotionally distant parents and siblings. So I've learned to just deal with my emotions instead of leaning on others. I believe this has led to a lot of moments in past romantic relationships where I simply did not know how to support a partner that was struggling with difficult episodes in their lives. They could have had a breakdown and I'd just be clueless about what to do to offer support in that moment. 

I'd usually try to support in the way I know how -- spending time with them, doing things for them around the house, trying to distract them from the issue, offering advice. But listening to hard emotions and 'being there' for them has always been tough. For example, sometimes there really wasn't anything that could be done about a shitty situation so I would just console my partner because there's simply nothing to do but accept and move on or try something different.  

In my current relationship, I'm constantly being called out by my girlfriend for not giving the emotional support she needs. She says that she is there for me in my rough moments. But when she is down or depressed, I don't give her the same kind of support she gives me. On one hand, I find this unfair because I do offer her support but it often seems to be simply not what she needs (as if it's lost in translation). I also always tell her that she can also just pull me aside and tell me what's bothering her. But she often puts her problems after mine and decides for herself that she can't share it if I'm already busy or depressed about something too. 

I'm already seeing a therapist to work on my emotional availability but it seems I am always failing to measure up to her standards of what emotional support should look like (e.g. ""I do this for you all the time, why can't you do this for me even just once?"" 

These dramatic arguments often leave me very bitter and frustrated that I don't seem to be able to support her even when I try. I'm close to just giving up on a relationship *again* out of frustration and disappointment over constantly being told that I'm not supporting her, which I read as ""not good enough as a boyfriend"".

I guess I'm writing here as a rant and also to understand : Where am I failing ? How can I become more emotionally supportive when emotional support is not my instinct?","My first piece of advice would be to to ask yourself what support techniques your partner uses to comfort you in times of need? Often, people support others the way they want to be supported. (hot tip: this usually works in the bedroom too; people will be intimate with you the way they want you to be intimate with them).

So I'd begin by trying to mimic her support techniques. Does she offer words of advice? Or simply listen (and *truly* listen)? Does she comfort you with physical affection? Does she try to relate to you by sharing times she's felt similarly so as to make you feel less alone? A bit of Google-fu should help you identify all the different techniques that people can use.

As an anxious person, she likely needs to talk about the issues and be heard rather than have them pushed aside in an attempt to forget about them. Forgetting about it and distracting really isn't an option for many anxious people. Lastly, as with all things, everyone is an individual, so use your knowledge of your relationship and your intuition when analysing the advice in this thread; for example some people *hate it* when you try to comfort them by relating to them with your own story as it feels like you're making it about you instead."

datingoverthirty,10c9e6j,1673753522.0,Slow start or friend zone?,"TLDR met 5 mo ago, quickly became friends. He has been subletting my place while I travel (Nov-April). We have been sending long voice notes several times a week, now even talking about trying to both move to the same tropical paradise (with his band mate) later this year. Is this a slow burning crush or am I reading into it?

Full scoop:

We met 5 months ago when he agreed to sublet my place for winter. He runs a Kirtan group and I have a masala chai business, so we started collaborating on events during my last few months in town. I got to know some of his friends and quickly became part of the crew. I‚Äôm now traveling and we exchange voice notes a couple of times a week‚Ä¶ often expressing gratitude for our connection and excited about what we are/can learn from each other. 

We both ended relationships last July with people we were serious with. I am absolutely over it, he has baggage from relationships in general and is on a intense spiritual path so not overly motivated to find  a new relationship although open to it. 

One of the things we have been talking about is wanting to move away from our current town. Similar vibe but some place warm. 

My issue is I can‚Äôt figure out for the life of me if he is crushing on me or not. I get it, we are not in the same place and no guarantees we will be in the future so why would we talk about being together. There is also this fact that he is subletting my space so I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs appropriate for me to broach the subject. He says things like my friends love you, and I love you, so I hope we end up in the same place. Has made comments that it would be cool if I joined the Kirtan group. 

I don‚Äôt know how any one on Reddit can answer this. But I‚Äôm going crazy. Is this a mutual crush or am I reading in to this constant communication and future daydreaming?

Thanks","From the outside, this sounds like friendship, not romantic interest.  

I am not sure I would continue daydreaming about him either way, because of this:  

> he has baggage from relationships in general and is on a intense spiritual path so not overly motivated to find a new relationship.   

He could genuinely think you're wonderful and still not be in the right place to date. I feel like people in this headspace will often say they're ""open to a relationship,"" and what it means is that if their fairy godparent showed up, waved a wand, and made the perfect match materialize, they'd be open to it. But I think this mindset comes with some idealizing and an unwillingness to compromise even on things that wouldn't be a big deal if they were in a healthier place."
datingoverthirty,10c43z7,1673738998.0,"He broke up with me and yet still wants us to be more than friends, just not in a relationship. Should I welcome that?","The relationship, 31/M, 34/F started as study partners and we talked online for several months. We met personally after 4 months and things became intimate right then and there. We didn‚Äôt realize we already were falling for each other that time. After several weeks, he decided to ask me if I was ok to be in this relationship as he already thought I felt the same way that we were already a couple. I honestly thought we were moving too fast but he was already saying he‚Äôs not planning to meet anyone else but me so I agreed. We were back to being in a long distance relationship as I had to go back to my country. 

Moving forward to this month, I got back and met with him. He stayed with me for a week and we got to know each other well. Unfortunately, there are differences in personalities and perspectives, made us fight a lot and have misunderstandings. Yesterday, he asked for some time to think if this is going to work in the future as we were both starting to settle down in a foreign country and this might end in a long distance thing, which is tough. He also said he cant stand fighting all the time and living together given our differences. After he left, he called and broke things up saying he can‚Äôt be a couple but he wants us to remain sweet and be friends. He still wants us to meet and talk just not be in a couple because of the future. I already had a feeling it was heading that direction and it only took him less than a day to think.

I agree this is tough to maintain in the future but I was willing to work things out and give us a try yet, he just wants us to be friends, still calling me darling. We both love each other obviously but him thinking of the future is what‚Äôs made him end it.

Should i continue talking to him and allow him to call me babe?
Would appreciate your thoughts. Thanksüôèüèª","What it is that YOU want?  Forget about what he wants.  What is it that you want?  Do you want to be intimate and emotional with someone who can't offer you a relationship?  Would that be what you want for yourself in 6 months?  A year?  5 years?

datingoverthirty,10bwn57,1673723605.0,Issues with finding a new apartment and dating,"Ugh I'm feeling like a toral jerk. I've been apartment hunting for some time. A major issue that's made it extremely difficult to find something even in the realm of my price range is (in the Bay Area!!!)that doesn't have major issues (such as bug infestations) is having a larger size dog. Most places have weight restrictions. I finally agreed to go a little higher in price and am now finding some units I'm considering, but most are top floor units that don't have elevators. I've been seeing a guy for about a month and half (though he was gone almost 3 weeks for vacation) who uses a wheelchair. I know he can make it up a few steps but I'm not sure if we could do a whole flight of stairs. One of the places I looked at has a bottom floor available, but it's a studio and I think it's way over priced. There's a top floor available for the same price and somehow seems nice and cozier. I'm still not sure whether I want to take either because I think it's overpriced for a studio. 

I reached out to the guy I'm seeing via text to see if me living on a second floor unit would be impossible. He lives at home with his parents currently, he's been saving for a home. So us hanging out at his place would be tricky too. 

I'm not sure how I feel about getting an apartment based around the needs of someone I've only been seeing less than 2 months, especially when it's been hard enough to find a place I can afford, is clean and safe, and can bring my dog. He is a really sweet guy but I'm not really sure about us long term yet. 

I plan to talk to him more tonight. I feel like this is a good time to ask what his plans are about his living situation. I don't think it should all fall on me to find a place, though I know the accessibility issue is part of what's held him back from renting and steered him into focusing on saving for his own place. 

Housing in the Bay Area if you're not a millionaire is an effing mess and I'm frustrated. 

Any thoughts?","*I'm not sure how I feel about getting an apartment based around the needs of someone I've only been seeing less than 2 months, especially when it's been hard enough to find a place I can afford, is clean and safe, and can bring my dog.

We met a couple of months ago when he had just resigned from his previous job - so he didn‚Äôt have a lot of tasks left, just transitioning his work, and was quite free. He was able to text a lot and could meet me 3-4 times a week.

Now that he started with the new company, his workload is back to the normal amount for his job (which is a fuck ton of work). He only has time to meet me once a week and texts only once per day (if that). For what it‚Äôs worth, I knew he‚Äôd be busier, but I didn‚Äôt realize that it was to this extent.

It may sound shallow and selfish but one of the reasons I liked him was that he was always available and gave me a lot of attention. Now that that‚Äôs gone, I feel sad and, shamefully, a little resentful.

Now I have some questions:

1. **Next Steps**: Should I wait this out and see if the situation changes? If I wait it out, how long sounds like a reasonable period of waiting? Should I bring up this need, knowing that he is at a transition point (new coworkers and new environment) and probably can‚Äôt give what I want anyway? Or should I just recognize that we have different priorities and schedules and let go of this amazing person?

2. **Am I the problem?** Are my expectations unreasonable? This guy clearly has healthy habits (he takes his rest after a vicious work week, schedules instead of ‚Äúbooty call‚Äù-esque dates, doesn‚Äôt text while at work, is attentive and doesn‚Äôt focus on his phone while we are together) so maybe the issue is with me?

I‚Äôm looking forward to your thoughts and advice!

Edit: Of course, I am working under the assumption that his busy schedule is the reason for decreased contact. He may actually be slow-fading me.

**Editing to answer commonly-asked questions:**

Re: work

- I work, but it‚Äôs a remote 40hr/week tech job that is I enjoy and rarely requires extra hours from me 

- his work requires him to be physically away (in another city or, sometimes, country) from Monday to Thursday every week

- he is not allowed (or at least, it is a very bad look) to use his phone during working hours

- this has been his job/career ever since, he is not new to the job itself, only to the company

- he really likes the work. ‚ò∫Ô∏è

- he has a goal promotion that he‚Äôd like to hit this year, he has mentioned this casually on the second date, I think 

- he once casually joked: he recognizes that this line of work ends up in divorce so (this part seriously-) he is planning on switching to a different but similar career ‚Äúsoon‚Äù (no concrete timeline)

- I knew his line of work was busy, BUT I had no idea they were *this* busy

- I‚Äôve asked about his new work several times (both in person and in text) and the answers are varying details of ‚Äústressful but interesting‚Äù. He is less detailed in texts, so I try to gauge whether he wants to text about it some more, use open-ended questions, that sort of thing.

Re: slow fading / timeline  

- I have tried to wait until he initiates the texts, and when he does, I am able to reply within the hour (almost often within the first 15 minutes). I ask light questions and check in with him. After that I usually get a reply after work hours, or on the morning of the next day

- when he does schedule dates, it‚Äôs a couple of days in advance, but if I‚Äôm not free (or unable to move my plans around) for that specific day, then it‚Äôs unlikely we‚Äôll meet for that week

- again, I understand that he is prioritizing his work. Anyone would do the same. But if that means dating is pushed out of the top 10 or 5 or whatever list of his priorities, then I think my concerns are warranted.",Yeah just talk to him about expectations around communicating and how often you each other.

datingoverthirty,10az5xu,1673628434.0,Do you believe in second chances in dating? Let's hear the successes and failures,"I (m) recently had a short term exclusive dating experience where I was very much taken with this woman.  I had kind of felt her moving away for a bit, and she eventually mentioned her ex and said she was confused about what to do given where she was at emotionally. I'm quick to make decisions, so I immediately thought it'd be best if we no longer see each other.  I know a lot of guys will stay and try to fight for a woman, but I've always felt like if I have to fight for her, it's probably not worth it. I've always put a lot of value on myself and what I bring to the table, so second chances are not in the cards.  I've broken things off with other women before after developing feelings for someone else, and I'd never go back to the first woman even if I liked her because I think she deserves better than me the second I say I have feelings for someone else.  If someone else distracted you once, what's to stop someone else from distracting you later down the line?

Am I an asshole or too firm in my beliefs about this?  Women, do you actually want men to fight for you in times like this? I'd love to know anyone's success and/or failure stories. Thanks.","Second chances are very much an ""it depends"" kind of thing. In general, I don't think I'd give any of my exes a second chance because a lot of my relationships ended due to incompatibility. Even if they could demonstrate that they had changed, I think I'd struggle to open up old wounds. 

That being said, my current girlfriend and I are a ""second chance"" situation. When we met about a year ago, we both felt a strong connection but things fizzled out due to bad timing and poor communication on my part. I'm delighted we have a second chance and I care about her a lot. I think the important thing is that things didn't fizzle out due to incompatibility but more timing. And, some time passed in between, allowing us to focus on ourselves and grow."

datingoverthirty,10ag4bj,1673570467.0,Need encouragement - how to summon the courage to ask a girl out who (I believe) is out of my league,"Connected randomly with a girl on IG a few months ago. Since then, we've msg'd each other sporadically about random stuff and it's always a good vibe. I really like her posts, positivity, music taste, and WICKED sense of humor, so an IG crush has developed. There's an age difference (me mid 40s, her mid 30s) and we're both parents to two kids.

Recently I saw her on Bumble and swiped right HARD :) I haven't matched with her, so either she swiped left, never saw me, or has me filtered out. I've been trying to get the courage to ask her out for a while now. Here's the problem: she is drop dead gorgeous and part of me thinks I have absolutely no chance, so why risk the rejection? I think I'm above average looking, maybe? Girls have told me that. But she's on another level. I have no problem asking girls out on dating apps, because at that point we've matched and there's expressed mutual interest. What's the worst that can happen? She says no, and I feel that nasty sting and the self esteem plummets again. I've had my fair share of rejection recently, once or twice is no big deal, but after enough times it starts to pile up and affect your feelings of self-worth.

Anyone have any tips on how to approach asking someone out on a non-dating app? Or maybe the reason for this post is to ask for some support and encouragement. I've been trying to psych myself up for weeks now. I understand that I'm being ruled by fear of rejection, but getting over this hump has been challenging to say the least.

datingoverthirty,10aapcb,1673557561.0,Success story: Just got married to the man I met on Reddit,"Hi r/dot! I wanted to give an update on what will hopefully be my last post on this subreddit. I'm married!

Five years ago, I found out my now ex-husband was trying to cheat on me with multiple people just two weeks before my 30th birthday. I entered my 30s feeling lonely as fuck and hella confused. I went on a couple dates in the first year but really started heavily using the apps around age 31.

Like a true nerd, I kept a journal of all my dates. I went out with  14 guys in 2018, 18 guys in 2019, 20 in 2020, and then 23 in 2021 with the 23rd guy being my now new husband. That's 75 people! I'm not going to sugar coat it, it \*sucked\* most of the time. You can check out my profile history to see how wound up I would get over mixed signals, ghosting, bad sex, all of it. 

In 2021 I started to lose hope and realized that if I went out on that many dates with guys from the apps, that the apps were not solving my problem. I decided to branch out and try to meet men in other ways. I started flirting in person more and I also started perusing r/r4r30plus. I eventually saw a guy post from my state who lived 2.5 hours away but seemed cool. We started texting and even had some video chats. About two weeks later we met at a halfway point for our first date and we've been practically inseparable since. 

On our one year anniversary he proposed and we just got married in November. We are currently trying for our first baby, which is something I've dreamed about for years and started to fear wouldn't happen for me.

He is the most amazing person. He's kind, patient, affectionate, grounded, hard-working, funny, and family-oriented. He's also totally my type physically and I still catch myself on a regular basis thinking, ""wait, am I \*sure\* this guy is ALL MINE?!"" 

In hindsight, I cannot believe the shitty behavior I would put up with from my dates in the name of ""realistic expectations."" I cried over some crusty-ass men who did not deserve my tears at all. GOOD people still exist out there, they're just harder to find. And trust me when I say I am completely average-looking as a woman, maybe even slightly below average-looking, so it's not like I have an upper hand in any way.

I think some things that helped my chances:

1. **I was willing to (and did) move for love.** I work remotely and moved 2.5 hours away to live with my husband. This expanded my dating net widely.
2. **I gave him a chance when he seemed kinda boring over texts at first.** For example, my man is not well traveled. He went on his first plane ride with me ever last year. In the past, I would have written that off as not adventurous enough. But now I know he's just someone who doesn't like to travel alone and that trait has had an insignificant impact on our relationship.
3. **I started asking for what I wanted right away.** I used to shy away from the marriage and kids conversation until the 3rd date or so in fear of scaring men off. In my last few months of dating, I started mentioning it immediately. I said hey, this is what I'm looking for. I'm looking for a man who is excited about having a wife and kids someday. And when it scared someone off, good. No more wasted time. When I told my husband that, he was \*relieved\* I said it because he wanted that too.
4. **I looked for guys outside of the apps.** Someone said on this subreddit once that the way to find your partner is to write down what kind of person you're looking for, then start putting yourself in places where that person would be. I knew that my ideal man would be someone who hates the dating apps. And that's when I had the epiphany to stop using them. My husband \*despises\* dating apps. He used r/R4R30Plus and that's it as far as online dating goes. If I would have never looked there, I would have never met him. 
5. **I kept my life open to be rearranged.** I know this gets so harder as we get older and more established in life, but I knew I had to keep myself flexible if I wanted a live-in marriage and kids someday. I was willing to rearrange things in my life in order to combine it with someone's elses. My weekly schedule looks a lot different than it used to be. My husband has cut back on WoW since his group had a rigid multi-day per week schedule. I'm very happy that we've found ways to make a new life together rather than expect each other to work around our current way of life no matter what.

This subreddit meant \*a lot\* to me when I was single so for any of you that gave me advice in the past or shared their experiences with me, thank you!","This is reddit, so I fully expected it to end with...Then I found out about his other wife.

datingoverthirty,10a3xow,1673541300.0,Men that talk about sex a lot,"I‚Äôve (32f) been talking to a 36m for about a month now. We‚Äôve not had sex yet, he knows I‚Äôm not ready and is OK to wait. He has said he is also looking to build something serious.

But he uses innuendo a lot in our chats, is very suggestive, and when we‚Äôre together, he‚Äôs very quick to cuddle and touch me. In fact, he even felt me up before we‚Äôd had our first kiss, cuddling on the couch.

It‚Äôs starting to feel like mixed signals. Verbally, he seems to convey he wants a relationship, at least when asked, yet his behaviour would suggest he‚Äôs after something casual. We do have strong sexual chemistry, but this still strikes me as being heavily focused on the physical side of things. Thoughts/experiences?","Other commenters have brought up whether or not he‚Äôs violating boundaries you‚Äôve set, and that‚Äôs up for you to decide and then communicate. But assuming he‚Äôs not‚Ä¶

You stated that he has verbalized the desire for a serious relationship but that the physicality seems emblematic of a desire for a casual relationship.

I would challenge that pretty strongly.

His desire for physical intimacy is likely a direct reflection of his desire to increase the overall intimacy he has with you. Emotional intimacy is just one side of the relationship equation and physical intimacy is, at its most biological level, the mechanism that our bodies employ to increase the intensity of a social relationship.

The complaints surrounding hook up culture aren‚Äôt that sex is a casual thing and that what‚Äôs get left out is the only REAL stuff (emotions). The complaint is that sex is ALSO a very real way to create relational intimacy and bonding (just like acts of emotional intimacy) but hook-up culture can lead to a diminished recognition of sex‚Äôs value in a healthy relationship. The casualness of continued hook-ups can ‚Äúcheapen‚Äù something that can have a tremendous value in a loving, securely attached relationship.

So I think your guy is not sending you mixed signals. Again, assuming he‚Äôs respecting your boundaries and everything is engaged with enthusiastic consent, he‚Äôs more likely sending the signal that he REALLY wants even more of a serious and connected relationship with you. 

I hope that helps!"

There's a lot of stigma around many of these issues. Some of these comments really reflect that stigma.","Wear who you are like a badge of honor, if you‚Äôve adapted and overcome struggles that speaks to the caliber of your character.

No need to spin a shiny web of lies to conceal your truth and life experiences.

I‚Äôd be careful about trauma bonding with potential dates, stay focused on your present life with an emphasis on where you‚Äôre going next rather than where you‚Äôve been. Offering up too many details early on about your past trauma can ultimately be a disservice to that end. I‚Äôd keep things generalized, light, and on the table for further discussion down the road‚Ä¶once you‚Äôre in a relationship where you‚Äôre fairly serious about each other.

We all have baggage. You don‚Äôt necessarily want to connect to the shitty underbelly aspect of life when you‚Äôre out and about, dating and meeting new people. What you want is to be able to meet someone who is open minded and willing to open their baggage up to you equally over a period of time. Time will serve as the measure of security for both of you to share the more intimate details about what you‚Äôve overcome.

Better to focus on the road ahead: look for shared life goals, your last big accomplishment(s), where you‚Äôre going at the end of this month and where you see yourself at the end of this year. The past certainly influences who we are, but it doesn‚Äôt define who we are.

On top of that, I see a lot of the same people that I‚Äôve seen on apps over the years. Many of them don‚Äôt even bother to update their profiles and are still using the same pictures from years ago.

Some people take the time to take new pictures, consider their profiles, even post for feedback on the internet.  However, most just use whatever pictures they have, say they love travel and food and call it a day.

There might be some fatigue when it comes to using apps and what you're probably noticing is your own disappointment with it.  ""Surely by now I should have met someone..."" while people who have only started using it are still getting that fresh hopeful experience.

Dating apps are still as popular as they ever were.  Probably even more so.  Which also has the (un?)intended effect of polluting the space.  There's a lot more...interesting...characters to be found now.  The signal to noise usually doesn't grow in our favor.

My general advice is that dating apps should be an accessory to finding dates, not the primary method.  It's far less depressing when it's just part of your strategy.

as per title i‚Äôve had a string of terrible relationships, assaulted by most, emotionally abused by another, cheated on by one. the last guy was actually decent and i opened up and decided to try hard to trust him then out of nowhere the thing that walks like a boyfriend talks like a boyfriend was never a boyfriend all along despite numerous conversations about being on the same page. 

i‚Äôve come to a stage where i am beginning to resent men (and i sincerely apologise but i only date men so it‚Äôs hard to say otherwise) for taking and taking whatever they can get with no consideration or respect for others feelings, even when i‚Äôve set clear boundaries. i‚Äôm in therapy and trying to fix my issues. 

but i wonder if other people have had strings of terrible relationships and how they found the ability to keep believing the best and hoping for a different outcome the next time?

edit: i‚Äôm overwhelmed by the quantity, kindness and maturity of the responses. you inspire me and give me hope in people. thank you for making this one woman‚Äôs suffering a little lighter.","I don't know if you've been getting in these relationships back to back, but if you haven't taken a break recently, I would also suggest considering it. This would allow you to focus more energy on therapy and healing. If you imagine a hurtful relationship as a scab, you can keep reopening the wound if you don't give it time to heal.

In addition, I would suggest reflecting on what ""hope"" means and requires. I think people often have a magical conception of hope where if I just keep thinking positive things, they will eventually happen. When, in reality, this can mean that you're engaging in the definition of insanity: doing the same thing over and over again hoping to get different results. 

Instead, what if hope is something that you actively work towards and cultivate? How can you approach relationships in a new way that may yield better results? Maybe it's a different approach to meeting people, to filtering people, the types of topics you do/don't discuss, attending more to your feelings than pleasing theirs, etc. Some may work, some may not, but once you stop trying, you often resort back to magical thinking.

This approach to hope isn't a one time thing but an ongoing thing, including once you enter a long-term relationship."

Even after a year, we never talk on the phone! If we did I would feel comfortable calling him up to have this convo. We only text and hang out in person.

One thing to be careful of here (and not to your actual question) is relying on others to ""fix"" your social behaviors and habits. That's a bad way to end up in a unilateral codependency that's unhealthy for both parties. But, moving on....  


>We only text and hang out in person. Am I supposed to set up another in person date just to break it off? Can I text my intentions and offer him the choice to meet to talk about it? 

So you're in a bit of a weird spot, but a 1+ year ""relationship"" even if it's kind of loose and casual is quite a chunk of time invested. That being said, myself and plenty of other folks posting here all aren't a fan of having an in person meeting just to get dumped. It sounds like as of a month ago you told him it wasn't going well, so this shouldn't blind side him.   


I'd just be direct at this point, use whatever communication you think they'd prefer (text or in person), and not overthink if one is ""right"" or ""wrong"" compared to the other."

I will say at the point I asked her, we weren‚Äôt communicating all day everyday of talking as much because I tend to reserve a lot of myself for until we make it official. Just dating = fun, connection in person and seeing if we have great chemistry.

The second quality is what side of you they bring out‚Äîyou want to make sure that the person brings out the best side of you and makes you feel desired, sexy, and beautiful.

It's going really well and we've established exclusivity & talk every day, even while traveling and over holidays. Dating him has been an amazing practice in secure attachment for me ‚Äì I tend to be more anxious but he is consistent, reliable, and communicative.

His job is sending him abroad for 3 months and we've decided to continue dating while he's gone.

Now what I'm looking for help with: I want to send him with some small gifts for things like Valentine's Day, his birthday, etc. He'll be living in hotels & Airbnbs and traveling around quite a bit, so they have to be really small and easy to pack.

And I'll say upfront that I know this is an anxiety/me problem, not a relationship problem. It's something I plan on discussing with my therapist.

I started seeing someone I really like (33F) in November. And I mean really, really like ‚Äì¬†the connection I feel with her has been more or less immediate. After a tough breakup last summer and a lot of bland dates, I know this is something I want to pursue and the feeling is clearly mutual: this woman is responsive, I feel she takes me and our relationship seriously, and we've had a conversation about being exclusive.

As part of getting more serious, I‚Äôd like to start introducing this woman to my friends. However, one of my friends (34M) is quite conventionally attractive and confident and also loves to hit on women. He's constantly dating and he's the guy that everyone loves. I'm not proud to admit it, but I'm feeling so hesitant to introduce him to my new girlfriend because I'm feeling...well, insecure and worried about a mutual attraction forming between them, or at least him trying to hit on her. What's weird is that I'm not generally nervous about my girlfriend around other men: she has tons of male friends and I don't feel any anxiety at all about it, nor am I nervous about her meeting other male friends of mine. I'm not sure what it is about this friend specifically that's prompting a lot of anxiety.

I guess I'm looking for a gut read on this situation and ‚Äì if you've struggled with this yourself ‚Äì advice for navigating it/managing the anxiety it provokes. As I said above, I know this is something I need to work on ‚Äì¬†because obviously pulling away or acting out of insecurity are sure ways to spoil both this new relationship and my friendship.

Putting social media profiles on dating apps seems to be common now. I think people do it to get followers/likes/attention ETC. I personally don't agree with it and ignored profiles where people state their usernames (When I was on apps) as I don't have any of those accounts."

datingoverthirty,105yj9i,1673122691.0,Does anyone else have trouble dating because their life is so fulfilled?,"Common advice for single people is to lean into bettering themselves, being involved in hobbies, and building a good support network of family and friends to be emotionally fulfilled. All of these things will ultimately make you a good partner and in a good place to start a healthy relationship. 

Has anyone ever found that doing all of this has actually led to them having trouble dating or starting relationships?

I‚Äôm 31F and live in a large major city. I have a great job in tech and live a comfortable life. I‚Äôm conventionally attractive, in good shape, and just genuinely really like myself as a person. I‚Äôm never bored or lonely, I have a small but really great social circle, hobbies and activities I love to do. I travel solo lots and throw myself into new experiences. I feel like I‚Äôve built this incredibly fulfilling life as a single person, that it‚Äôs hard to break away from it to date and start relationships. 

While I would like a partner I don‚Äôt feel any sort of despair over not having one. I‚Äôm happy to be single unless it‚Äôs the right person - I just worry I won‚Äôt meet the right person because I‚Äôve filled my life with all these other things that I can‚Äôt make space for them. 

I don‚Äôt have trouble getting matches on OLD or getting dates. I‚Äôve been on lots of dates with plenty of nice men but it‚Äôs like the more I‚Äôve invested in myself the less I‚Äôve been able to find a connection? I can chat to anyone and have a good time but it just always seems like something is missing. 

I guess my question is - does anyone else experience this? Were you able to date or find a partner regardless? Do I need a mindset change in how I approach dating? Or should I just avoid OLD and actively trying to date entirely?","I think part of why people give that advice to throw yourself into hobbies, bettering yourself etc. is so that when you have the prospect of going on another date with someone, you're thinking, ""Is being with this person better than being alone?"" rather than ""Is being with this person better than being lonely?"" People who are answering the second question will get into unhealthy relationships much more easily."

datingoverthirty,1059pi6,1673049144.0,Dangling the carrot‚Ä¶,"I posted on this board a long time ago, over a year ago about having feelings for a work colleague. He was married at the time and so I tried to move on from it. 

In the last year I dated one male for a short time and ended it because I didn‚Äôt have feelings for him. Then I got into a short term relationship (4 months) with another male but ended it at the beginning of December because I just didn‚Äôt feel the same way as he did for me. 

All the while still seeing my colleague about at work sometimes although we don‚Äôt work as closely together any more but both knowing the feelings we have for each other are still there. He would show some kind of jealousy when I was with these other guys telling me he didn‚Äôt like them for one reason or another and the chemistry between us was still there in the air like you could physically touch it. 

These feelings have been brewing for well over two years now and after sending drunk messages on New Year‚Äôs Eve, on New Year‚Äôs Day I told him I can‚Äôt take it any more and I need him out of my system. I told him he was blocking me from having feelings for anybody else and I told him I wasn‚Äôt prepared to wait around forever for him. I told him I was frustrated at the situation. He agreed but then would say things like, you never know what will happen and we end up getting flirty again. 

He isn‚Äôt with his wife any more, but I‚Äôm at the end of my tether and although I like him so much, he‚Äôs like an addiction, he gives me this little bit of hope, dangles the carrot and then nothing comes to fruition. 

At the end of this month, an opportunity will arise where he can spend some time with me. Should I tell him if he doesn‚Äôt take the opportunity a line will be drawn and I‚Äôll be done and give him that one last chance to act upon the feelings or do I just already once and for all call it a day? 

I can‚Äôt understand why after all this time, he is still worried about moving anything forward.","Ok...I'm probably going to come off as an asshole here. I went through your post history to understand some context.

You went through a bad breakup, then pursued your married collegue. And before you say you didn't pursue him, you told this married man, who had a wife and daughter at home, that you had feelings for him. Of course, he gave you the classic ""marriage has been over a long time "" line that cheating married men often give. So now, apparently they're no longer together. Are you sure? How do you know? Is that what he said or have you done anything to confirm this?

The guy sounds like a bastard to me. Cheaters like to bait you to keep you hooked.

My advice is to start seeing a therapist as you may not be over the break up and you coped by pursuing someone unavailable."

***************************************

I browse this subreddit a lot and really value the discourse here. People give a level of depth I see lacking in other dating subreddits. I do date people aged anywhere from 25-40, so I think this post is appropriate. And yeah I did get the go-ahead from mods that it would be okay to post even though I'm not yet 30.

I'm a weird hipster dude located in Brooklyn, and that's the type of person I'm going for. Into all genders. I'm just curious what vibe my profile gives off, how I can improve, etc.

I have two versions of my profile, the [former](https://imgur.com/a/ZestaAc) of which I had for a year-ish up until a month ago which I think is more universally likeable but more generic. The [latter](https://imgur.com/a/Wd099KS) I switched to about a month ago, I think it's objectively worse but the pictures show my personality better. The latter definitely feels more zoomer-y to me too, so it'd be interesting to get a gut check from y'all if that's true. I've been getting a surprising number of likes sent to me on Hinge with the latter, so not sure which I prefer yet.

Open to any and all feedback -- as you can probably tell from the collection of photos across both profiles, I rarely take photos of myself, so I try to more heavily rely on the personality the photos portray rather than to generically look good. But I might be going too far in that direction.

Thanks y'all!","Yes def feeling the presence of zoomy youth reading this 

I get that Gen Z has a different lingo and that younger people's profiles are more casual and slangy, but if your *goal* is to match with people in their 30s this comes across as too juvenile to me (2 b, Idaho baby, etc)

What seems carefree when you're in your 20s feels like ""trying too hard to be casual"" in your 30s bc no one else is doing it. However I am pretty normie these days so a rebellious heart might beat different 

I imagine most of your matches are in the younger age range but I could be wrong, I don't represent everyone's tastes - also am not as familiar with how discerning gay men would be if you're dating both/all genders, so ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"

Hi Reddit! 

I(34/F) have a date tonight with a guy(39/M) I met on Stir, an app for parents trying to date üòÇ so far the conversation has been good‚Ä¶ definitely improved once we swapped phone numbers‚Ä¶ but I‚Äôm nervous and just want some advice from men (or women!) on what NOT to do on a first date that may not be obvious. 

For background, my ex and I divorced a bit over 2 years ago and I spent the first year very casually dating, oftentimes being drunk, and not taking anything seriously, just doing my rebound thing. I‚Äôm now ready emotionally for something serious and he is too, but I‚Äôve never really been on a ‚Äúgrown up date‚Äù before, as sad as that sounds lol. I don‚Äôt drink anymore for personal reasons and we are going ice skating, which I think is very cute, and will give us plenty of time to talk. 

I‚Äôm not socially weird or anything but I‚Äôm kind of a goofball and an oversharer, and I sometimes swear like a sailor lol. I‚Äôm going to try and cut down on the oversharing and swearing (at least for tonight!) but was hoping for some insight on what makes a good first date. 

Wish me luck!! Thanks for any thoughts!","It's just a get to know you moment. Don't expect to fall in love or find your soul mate immediately.  Keep the expectations low: a good conversation, learn about someone new, learn how to share your story, and it will most likely be successful. 

Also, remember that he may very well be as nervous as you. Try to put him at ease. Ask him questions, and actively listen to him."
datingoverthirty,103ww22,1672918717.0,Thanks for giving me the courage to speak up about wanting a relationship,"It sounds silly, but I grew up watching these dating coaches advising you to NEVER talk about wanting a relationship if you didn‚Äôt want your date to run away out of pure pressure. They made it seem that if you didn‚Äôt put on an air of mystery, you wouldn‚Äôt ignite any  desire in the other person. You need to trigger a need to ‚Äúhunt‚Äù or ‚Äúpursue‚Äù ‚Äî which, looking back, ew.

It took me an (embarrassingly) long time to realise how dumb that is. Part of the reason I was eventually able to shake off those beliefs is this sub and the conversations happening here. So many of you have encouraged openness, honesty and clarity in your dating style ‚Äî and for someone growing up with low self-esteem, the advice has been invaluable. My whole life, I‚Äôve had a lot of shame about my own needs. But it‚Äôs ok to want what you want and express it, and it doesn‚Äôt make you any less attractive.

Last night I told someone who was giving off very casual vibes exactly what I wanted. And I asked him what he wanted. And to my surprise, he got vulnerable with me and told me he wanted to build something serious too. He had seemed very fun-loving and breezy up until that point, and this conversation let me see another side of him. It also made me feel confident in dating him ‚Äî that we were on the same page.

I previously would have stayed quiet and hoped we‚Äôd end up somewhere, or then walked away out of anxiety that I‚Äôd eventually get played.

So thanks to this sub. I may have learned later rather than sooner, but I got the message now.","I really don't understand playing games, or being disingenuous over such things - be genuine about your wants, needs, & desires &, if the person you're with isn't compatible, you'll know quickly & can both move on.

datingoverthirty,103mycs,1672885773.0,How does one deal with a complete 180 when things are good and they end it?,"I was seeing this guy long distance for four months. We knew each other previously being old coworkers about six years ago. We had even hooked up a couple times then. 

We ran into each other in the summer and it just kept going from there.  Things were going well. Everything felt comfortable and safe. We have insane chemistry. I usually have extremely bad dating anxiety (it‚Äôs literally my Achilles heel) and I wasn‚Äôt feeling it at all during this time. 

We went on a trip together for a week and it was awesome. Afterwards the communication was still good.  Out of nowhere he pulls the rug out from under it and says he was genuinely not trying to get into a relationship, but when he saw me in the summer he thought it would have been stupid not to pursue things but misjudged the situation and has since realized he can‚Äôt put the energy into a relationship. He has a lot to work on still. Out of respect for me he‚Äôs letting this go (despite this being good).

There‚Äôs a ton more additional context to what he said but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs necessarily relevant to get the point across and don‚Äôt want this turning into a twenty paragraph post. 

I am having a really hard time right now and really hate being in my head. I can‚Äôt stop psychoanalyzing this.

datingoverthirty,103kyx8,1672880498.0,looking for insight from those with inconsistency issues in relationships or those who have been in relationships with inconsistent people,"TLDR: my three month relationship just ended because of my inability to deal with inconsistency issues in our relationship / their inability to improve these issues. looking for advice and insight from those who have experienced something similar.

at the beginning of our relationship this person made their interest in me incredibly clear - texting throughout the day, wanting to get to know me, excited to take me out, talk of future dates, etc. our first two dates were great - and at the time of our second date, he suggested that we set aside one night a week for date night in our schedules - this communicated to me that he was serious about moving things forward. around this same time, (about 6 weeks into the relationship), i had only seen him three times in person at this point, and i had felt that his texting behavior had become a bit hot and cold, and felt him pulling away. this coupled with the fact that id only seen him three times in six weeks, i started to feel like i was on unsure footing here - that his actions weren't matching his words. I brought this up as part of a longer conversation of where we saw things headed, and what we wanted from our relationship. throughout this conversation we both communicated to each other that we really liked each other, wanted to date each other exclusively, and wanted to try moving forward with the intent of an LTR. he communicated to me at this time that his inconsistency issues had caused all of his  past relationships to end, but that he wanted to try to work on it. he was not able to articulate exactly how this time would be any different, but that he really wanted to try. i agreed to stick around as long as i saw improvement and that they were trying - i was fully willing to be flexible on timelines as long as i saw effort and an increase in consistency. i wish at the time i had asked what it was about consistency that is so difficult, or what it is that scares him about it (intimacy? rejection? i can now only guess).

the week after this conversation, his texting behavior went back to ""normal"" - lots of messages throughout the day and i felt he was making an effort to maintain the connection. during the first week after our conversation, he had a stressful work week so we pushed our date off to the next week. the week after that he got sick, and it got pushed again. we finally meet again, and things were great - they are always great in person and i feel very cared about. i start to feel momentum and connection coming back for us, and i assumed this was the start of our weekly dates - when he left he kissed me goodbye and said i'll text you later to pick a day for next week. although we talked throughout the following week, it took him 8 days to reach out to see when i was free the following week. i thought about reaching out earlier myself, but in our last conversation it felt like the ball was very much in his hands to reach out more often and show more effort, so i waited. when he reached out, i told him three days i was available, and got the response ""im thinking probably x day or x day"". the next day he narrows it down slightly and mentions ""right now im thinking x day is best"". the next morning, i said that i needed him to let me know by the end of the day so that i can plan other things - he says he will be out with his friends for NYE but that he absolutely will. he does not. i text him a photo of my outfit for NYE that night, and he doesn't respond. next day, he says nothing about my photo, and just asks how my NYE was. i let him know that im hurt he never confirmed our date when he said he would, and that he left me on read all night and that it made me feel like i wasnt on his mind. this text was the beginning of the end.

the next two days we go back and forth about how he really cares about me and wants to be with me, and that hes sorry for dropping the ball and being inconsistent. he says that just because he didnt respond to my text or confirm our date night that it doesnt mean he wasnt thinking about me and that it doesnt mean he doesnt want to be with me. he says maybe we should reconsider our relationship if he isnt meeting my expectations. i get immediately frustrated that my communicating my hurt feelings results in him immediately suggesting a breakup as opposed to him trying to repair, but i guess i can't fault him for being self-aware that it's just not working. we go back and forth a bit and ultimately i communicated that i can see he is trying sometimes but ultimately if i can't actually FEEL his feelings for me by him showing me them through actions, that its all in his head. that his words and actions must align for me to feel truly cared for. and that we clearly want and need different things from this relationship. we end up on a soft and caring note, wishing each other well, telling each other that we will miss our time together, and that we dont regret the time we spent together.

now this is where i'm looking for advice, insight, or stories from others that are similar. for those who have been inconsistent but really did care about your partner and your relationship - what was it about consistency that was difficult for you? was it a fear of intimacy, something else? i know everyone is different but i am really struggling to understand how someone could provide me commitment and intent, but then fail on consistency. i feel like consistency and commitment are often paired, so to get one without the other was hard for me to grapple with. for those who have experienced my side of this in relationship, did it ever get better or do you wish you had gotten out sooner like i did?

i am absolutely heartbroken about this because there was so much potential. there was SO much in our relationship that was so good (didn't really go into detail about it here, but we have tons of overlapping life experience, similar sense of humor, very caring and kind, great sexual compatibility, and a huge spark). but this issue of not seeing each other frequently enough to build momentum was a huge problem for me. i keep going back and forth in my head if there is anything i could have done, but realistically i just wasnt willing to make my needs smaller and become someone i'm not to force this thing to work. but the what if's are killing me. i saw such a great future for us - he was so kind and loving when we were together, and i already miss him so much. i hate that i will theoretically never get to talk to him again, never get a good morning text, never wake up next to him, never get another forehead kiss. ive already started fantasizing about six months down the road maybe he will be different and it will work. i know this is foolish. but im in so much pain.  i cant help but second guess everything.

thanks everyone for listening. <3","It sounds like y‚Äôall‚Äôs chemistry was stronger than compatibility. You can vibe with someone and have all these amazing feelings and not be compatible . I have experienced that a numerous amount of times. Also , I‚Äôd recommend when someone tells you who they are/ how they operate the first time believe them . He told you that his inconsistencies was a deal breaker with other women and you experienced them as well and stayed . It‚Äôs challenging to do , but something I‚Äôm learning is you have to operate from a logical standpoint. If you‚Äôre still trying to figure out what you want in a partner understandable , but if certain characteristics/qualities in a person doesn‚Äôt work for you ‚Ä¶learn to cut it off early . It‚Äôll help your heart in the long run."
datingoverthirty,103jo9u,1672877177.0,"Friend Ghosted Me, Trying to Get Over Her by Dating"," Around last February, I met a girl at a Hibachi place, and long story short, while we never dated, we did become very good friends. Some of you might or might not remember when I asked for advice after getting her number. [https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/sscm2a/comment/hwyeh9j/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/sscm2a/comment/hwyeh9j/?context=3)

 And for several months, I had the best several months in recent memory. She invited me to go out to bars with her friends, who shortly became my friends. We went to Sea World several times, and at times spent the entire day together, and even that didn't feel like enough time for either of us. In May, I told her that I would like to become more than just friends when we both had a stable career, and neither of us had to work 2-3 jobs to live. I figured that if there was going to be any fallout, it would follow shortly. That we weren't dating now didn't matter. She was the type of girl that I wish I met in high school or college. And more importantly, she encouraged me to pursue my dream of going back to college, and supported by choice to try to go back on Social Security (I have Asperger's Syndrome and ADHD, so working 2-3 jobs like her probably wouldn't end well). I figured that even if she wasn't in to me, as long as I was with her group, they'd probably help me find someone to go out with. She had already introduced me to this one girl from Mexico who was over-the-top gorgeous, and she quickly became a good friend of mine as well. If she hadn't moved back down to Mexico, there was a good chance I would have asked her out, and there was a good chance she would have said yes. Around June, my confidence in myself and the future was at an all time high.

  June through September, I thought that we were okay. She still seemed to be reciprocating my attempts to spend time with her. Whereas before, I felt lonely, frustrated, and increasingly jealous of guys with a girl of their own over the building over the past several years, I was actually genuinely happy and content.

 As of now, she almost never returns my texts, starting on October 11th, and doesn't read them. Perhaps looking back, that she kept cutting our time together short starting around May, and the last time that we were together was in June should have been a warning sign. As should have been when I asked about seeing a movie with a friend she introduced me to, and forgot who I was talking about, which looking back was a foreshadowing.  One of her friends, who once called me my friend, also started ghosting me in October, even though I never asked why she wasn't returning my texts. And while it might well be that they are just busy, nobody should be too busy to return the occasional text, or tell someone they just won't have time to get together for X amount of time.

 As of now, I know that I need to move on, and I'll never do so as long as I'm alone like before I met her, so I've dusted off my dating profiles, and tried making adjustments. To be fair, I finally did get an honest-to-goodness first date, like my first ever. But it wasn't the fairy-tale ending I was looking for, and I rarely ever get any more matches. Which is not what I want. I feel that the longer I am alone again, the more depressed and bad about myself I'm going to feel. The way I see it, if she no longer wants to be friends with me, I should find someone to actually date, because that will help me feel happy again.

 I figure that there must be something I can do in order to get more matches. I was inspired by a post another member made about how changing out his wardrobe made an enormous difference, and women started to approach him in real life, which would work best for me, because I'm introverted, and find that it feels more natural when other people initiate.

 So I've taken photos of my Facebook dating profile, and posted them here. What can I do to improve it?

 Living with my parents, not currently having a career, and no longer having a car are obstacles that I am aware of. I also have early onset male pattern baldness. The first two are not going to change for at least two years, and there is nothing I can do about it. 

 Are these obstacles insurmountable? 

 Is it my wardrobe that needs a complete overhaul + a new set of photos? What should I be wearing in order to attract potential matches?

 Can they be compensated/overcome? I know that I'm not perfect. I'm not expecting whoever I date to be so either, but I am using that to drive me to improve myself by doing things such as going to the gym, and starting sessions with a personal trainer, and to overcome whatever the odds may be, and I hope to be extended the same consideration.",Only one piece of advice. Embrace the baldness. Get a very close buzz cut and never look back. You can‚Äôt half ass hair. My current gf loves it and says my in between hair stages looked awful.
datingoverthirty,103cv11,1672861322.0,I feel silly for getting the ick over this a small interaction I had with a man about a shared hobby. Is my gut onto something or am I being a little sensitive?,"I(32F) met a guy at a bar about a month and a half ago. We chatted for a while at the bar and got into some good deeper conversations. We exchanged numbers and have hung out at his place a few times since then and out with some of his friends once. We haven‚Äôt even kissed so I‚Äôm not sure he wants anything romantic but my gut says he‚Äôs open to it if I make it abundantly clear that I‚Äôm interested. I‚Äôm not actively dating so I‚Äôm just going with the flow and getting to know him platonically first. 

Chess is one of the things we bonded over the night we met. I play casually online daily but have put next to no energy into studying the game. He mostly plays on a real board at his job between clients appointments. 

I challenged him to an online match and won! The next day over text he mentioned food I left at his place and I told him he could have it, joking that it was the least I could do after kicking his butt so hard in the chess game. He responded by telling me he was not impressed and thought I would checkmate him sooner but that he was looking forward to a rematch. 

A few days later I challenged him again and again won the game. Over text we confirmed plans to meet tomorrow to watch a TV show and play a physical game of chess. I again joked that I was giving him the benefit of the doubt that he stands a chance against me on a real board and to remind me again how he wasn‚Äôt impressed. He again responded that he was not impressed and told me I only won because he made a blunder. He followed up saying that a probably play a lot and am barely intermediate. 

I‚Äôm making it very clear that my words are playful in tone (with emoji‚Äôs and exaggerations and such) but he didn‚Äôt make it clear if he was being serious or not. It honestly read as being quite serious. I‚Äôm already put off by his words, but want to stay on a playful note without letting him put me down like that in case he‚Äôs being serious. 

I remind him that I am indeed a casual player who said when we met that I play a lot but almost never study the game and that maybe he should be impressed by my casual skills (of still beating him twice in a row in under 30 turns with ample material still in the board). I half joked that I‚Äôm pretty one has to win a game before they can start talking shit to their opponent. Again, I found a way to teeter a line between playful banter and ‚Äúyour petty put down games aren‚Äôt cute so quit it‚Äù. 

His response was that he‚Äôll just pay $100 (like I did for the yearly membership) to talk shit to a casual with the eye roll emoji. I have a hard time interpreting that as anything but serious and instantly gave me big ick vibes. I know I‚Äôm talking a big game but I took care to phrase it in a friendly way and well‚Ä¶I *did* win both games! 

I really didn‚Äôt like how he brought up how much I spent on a membership that I haven‚Äôt really utilized since I first got it. Or how he is seeming more and more incapable of admitting that I just might be a better player than him, casual or not. I know how silly that sounds but I feel like it could be an indication of how he‚Äôd act in similar situations. 

Thoughts? What would your next move be (pun intended)? Would you let this slide, bring it up, or stop seeing this person?","Broadly, I don't think there's anything strange or improper about getting turned off by someone being overly competitive.  That is not particularly attractive.  
  
That being said:  
  
You give a back and forth of your communications.  You describe all of yours as ""I was being playful,"" ""I was joking,"" ""I walked the line between not being serious but respectfully letting him know I wasn't putting up with nonsense.""  You describe all of his communications as ""he may have been joking or serious, but I'm pretty sure he was serious.""  
  
I wonder if he would have the exact opposite take: ""this woman I don't really know is making fun of me, and it feels kind of mean spirited, so I'm trying to 'give it right back' without being out-and-out mean in the hopes that she'll just move on.""  
  
I mean, we don't really have any way of knowing.  Whenever there's a post here, we're always getting only one side of the story.  Based on your descriptions, yeah, it sounds like the guy is being a bit of a jerk, and it would turn me off too.  And I don't have any reason to think your impressions are off or unwarranted (I want to be really clear: based on what you've written, it absolutely sounds like you're being playful and he's taking things way too seriously).  But I'm just not sure we can give an objective answer to this just based on what we have here.  I think the best we can do is ""if it bothers you, it's not unreasonable to end it because of that."""

datingoverthirty,1033fbt,1672838069.0,Would you date someone going to med school?,"I [32M] started dating a 26F grad student the last 4 months. At first it was mostly to hook up but she has really been caring and thoughtful and we‚Äôve ended up spending a lot of time together. We‚Äôve done relationship type things the last few months (dinners, gift exchanges, watching each others pets, introduced me to family). 

She is graduating this summer and then starting med school. I‚Äôve been really thinking about it and if she was planning to start a career in the summer I‚Äôd be much more inclined to keep things going. But hearing her plans for med school and the 5-6+ year commitment is very oft putting. I‚Äôm pretty established in my career and ideally I find someone similar

I just haven‚Äôt connected with someone as a person like this in a long time and it‚Äôs a bit of a bummer. I can see myself chasing after these qualities about her in someone else but have a difficult time finding it.","As someone who‚Äôs gone through vet school, a brother through medical school and multiple friends in other professional schools‚Ä¶ nothing can adequately prepare you for the time suck these careers take from you. School alone is 4 years. Then residency is another 4+ years. Not to mention the incredible stress from exams (regular and board). Since you‚Äôre established in your career, will you be ok with sparsely seeing your partner? And when you do she could be a bundle of nerves and try to only talk about school. Are you ok with her missing family functions or big parties? Working over the holidays as a student and early resident? 

I‚Äôm not saying it can‚Äôt work. But I think a more established relationship would be better able to survive the beating having seen this myself. I‚Äôm not saying dump her now. Just keep it extremely casual if you think there‚Äôs a chance you can consider her longterm to spare both of ya‚Äôll‚Äôs hearts. But just know the first 3 years of school is awful. And the first 2-3 years of residency is equally bad. If she wants to be a surgeon or dermatologist, gastroenterologist, etc even worse."

He was so insistant to walk me back despite me refusing that I ended up faking a route and entering a random building with someone else.

[Edit: It was fun to go through your stories, thanks for participating despite the dreadful typo! 
Sorry if you didn't get to date, may you find comfort from our horror stories.
A sum-up, if you don't want to be a terrible date:

- Don't lie about your age/put deceitful pictures
- Show up, or cancel like a grown up if you are not ready to date, met someone you like or are in a terrible mood
- Communicate about being late (getting french fries for yourself is *not* a good excuse)
- Shower/don't be covered in dust, strong smells, especially if there is a chance you'll get naked
- Pick a sensible place (not a sensible place: your car/van, your mom's place, a lavomatic, a restaurant where you can't eat anything...)
- Don't monologue about you ex ffs
- Don't monologue about one gender being one thing
- Don't monologue about politics 
- Don't monologue about strip clubs, porn or your fwbs
- Don't monologue on a topic your date knows much better than you (their job, their neighbourhood...)
- Don't try to test your date's knowledge all evening 
- Don't try to do your date's mental health diagnosis 
- Be grateful if someone pays for you
- Be aware of people's commute time and efforts
- Offer to split the bill
- Accept to split the bill if you're frustrated about finances
- Chill, don't yell at your date or serve them the silence treatment 
- Come alone, nobody prefers a 1st date with your mom, friends, church choir, a dealer or a badly trained dog
- Don't do coke or any other hard drug 
- Don't flaunt an animal (or human) cadaver lmao
- Don't put your hand on your date's mouth, don't squeeze their head, don't forcefully hug them
- Don't use your spit as body lotion, especially not on someone else (???)
- Say goodbye in person rather than from the toilets
- Yes, keep on disclosing your previous felonies

I met him at a sushi restaurant and was surprised to find he was also meeting a couple friends there. He introduced me as his ""woman"" to everyone. It was so cringe, I had only matched with him that day and basically the only conversation was logistics, no reason to think we had built any kind of connection to where that would be appropriate. He proceeded to spend the evening basically boasting about his lifestyle -which honestly sounded like he is living beyond his means. At one point his friend's wife and I were alone and she asked me how long we had been together. I told her we weren't and showed her his profile and our conversation. She told me she had been a little grossed out because he's in his 50s (profile said early 40s) and she thought I was in my early 20s (actually 34). She was really nice once she realized the situation and we actually had a nice conversation. I called the shuttle immediately after dinner, he made a move that looked like he was going in to hug and/or kiss me goodbye. I backed up a bit and she got in between us and told him ""she doesn't want to kiss you, you catfished her and then acted like you were more than you were, be glad she didn't make a scene and was fun, leave her alone."" I hugged her goodbye and left. 

Real low opinion of him but that lady was awesome so, silver lining."
datingoverthirty,102vlf4,1672811786.0,"Update - ""what to make of people who change their minds in extremely early stages""","Two weeks ago I posted about a guy who rejected me when he'd been shown my profile by a matchmaking service (after I'd said yes) but reached out three months later via email asking for us to get to know each other:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/zs9oma/what\_to\_make\_of\_people\_who\_change\_their\_minds\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/zs9oma/what_to_make_of_people_who_change_their_minds_in/)

We had a phone call that verged on absurd. He spent a very long time describing his childhood and his relationship with his sister and how our very small ethnic community ostracized them after his sister's divorce. He used to receive lots of marriage inquiries and after the divorce those inquiries stopped and  he had a few breakups caused by it too. He signed up for the matchmaking service to get away from our community (told the matchmakers that too) and rejected my profile because he wanted someone from outside.

He then said he wanted to talk to me ""because of our similar interests"" (hobbies that both of our profiles mentioned). I asked him what changed (why he was now open to talking to people within the community when he wasn't before) about 12 times and he never gave me a real answer. Just that he had paid a lot of money to be shown profiles from outside our community, but that we had a lot of similarities. I kept digging and then he said he never opened my profile to begin with so didn't know how similar we were. He said he talked to every single other person the matchmaker showed him. He reached out to me one day after his 3-month subscription ended.

It felt like an ""I thought I could do better and now I'm going back through the reject pile"" situation. He offered to send me receipts and emails between him and the matchmaker to prove he paid for his membership himself (and not his parents) and that their initial email didn't show my full profile. He came across as very negative and neurotic on the phone call. I am not interested. The end.","Assuming desi community, yes, it is very common."

We know dating can be frustrating and this is the place to talk about it.,"(37, F) After countless disappointments on the dating apps, I took a long break from them (nearly a year!). Decided to give them a try again last month. Went back on Hinge, and started talking to a guy (42, M). Exchanged a few nice messages before Christmas and then exchanged phone numbers with the plan to meet up at some point for a coffee or drink. 

He asked if he could call me last night for a chat and I said sure. So he rang and we chatted for a bit. Just by our conversation I could tell I wasn‚Äôt really feeling him, but decided not to judge too early and still commit to meeting him f2f. After about a 20 minute convo and agreeing to meet for a drink next week he said he needed to tell me something. I said ok sure. 

He told me he wasn‚Äôt actually the age he put on his dating profile and that he was older. I didn‚Äôt t even ask at the point what age he was, I just said ‚Äúoh‚Äù. He proceeded to then explain why he had lied about his age. He said he read somewhere (from some dating guru article or something) that women don‚Äôt mind if men‚Äôs ages on their profile are within 5 years of their actual age as long as they tell them before meeting. He said he wasn‚Äôt getting matches with his actual age and that he connects better with people my age anyhow (said all his friends are in their 30s and he often gets mistaken for being in his 30s too). He finally told me he was actually 47 not 42. 

I told him I didn‚Äôt even have a problem with his age, but I did have a problem with someone lying to me from the get go. He then told me that‚Äôs why he told me upfront before meeting because he didn‚Äôt want to seem disingenuous. I told him it‚Äôs disingenuous to lie about your age (or anything) on your dating profile in the first place to get more matches and that it‚Äôs extremely manipulative. 

Long story short, I told him I was going to pass on the date because him lying about his age really didn‚Äôt sit well with me. So, dating apps in 2023 for me are off to a flying start! 

Men: don‚Äôt lie about your age or anything else on your profile to get more matches thinking women will be okay with that. They won‚Äôt be.

datingoverthirty,102e5jr,1672767604.0,Cutting off contact? and how?,"I think I should cut off contact with someone I was dating almost half a year ago. Im looking for advise if you  think it is indeed the best thing to do and how to do this? I would like to be respectful about this.

For context, I went on 5 dates with her before I went travelling for half a year. Both of us agreed that despite liking each other, there is no point in committing if Im away for such a long time. We should both just enjoy our lives, and we will just see how time flows and maybe meet again when Im back.

We stayed in touch by text quite often, every 5 days or so, in the beginning flirty full of jokes but messages became more updates of travels over time. Not necessarily bad, I liked giving the updates and the conversation kept flowing. It was platonic, but I always had in my mind to just go on a date again when Im back home.

Then I met another woman on my travels. We hit off so well! I totally fell for her and vice versa. Unfortunately I had to say goodbye after a month of being together on daily basis, but I think about her all the time and still text her a lot.

In a month I will be back home, but I dont think Im in the mindset that I want to go on a date with anyone else at the moment. I also noticed that I got less interested in giving travel updates to the woman I was dating before  (much more time in between updates)

Would you agree to cut off contact? And if so what do I even say?  And should I at least wait another month when Im back home?","I would wait the month. The conversation is platonic, keep it that way while you are still thinking about this other person. But realistically, it might be a matter of out of sight out of mind, and a month from now with a living breathing person in front of you, you might feel differently."
datingoverthirty,1021har,1672730838.0,Intercontinental trip but he doesn't love me (yet),"**TL/DR:**  My boyfriend and I are not on the same page in terms of our feelings for each other, and I would like advice about how to give him more time to develop deeper feelings and feel comfortable expressing them without damaging myself or the relationship in the process. We're on the same page about this being a critical need for me, and he wants to develop this capacity (versus just doing it to please me).  

OP:

Hi all, my boyfriend and I are starting to plan a two-week trip in February to his home country to meet his family for the first time. We went on a week trip in November to visit my parents on the other side of the US. I'm feeling hurt and concerned today because I brought up my need for us to be able to express love to each other verbally (for the 2nd time, first significant conversation was a couple months ago) and he doesn't feel it for me yet. He's a 39M and was not verbally affectionate with his previous long-term gf either. He says he's trending in that direction, the trip will help, and he's working on this with his therapist. We've been exclusively dating for 7 months, casually dated for 9 months prior to that, so we've spent quite a lot of time together. The rest of the relationship is good - he's emotionally supportive, affectionate and consistently kind. I wasn't fully emotionally available either when we first met, recovering from a couple tough relationships, but have done my best to show up for him emotionally since we've been committed to each other.

I think I'm willing to go on the trip and see what unfolds afterwards, but would like some advice on how to cope in the meantime since I'm starting to feel hurt, extra vulnerable and rejected."," I'm not sure how ""in the weeds"" you've gotten about what he's working on with his therapist... maybe it would help to know in order to understand that this isn't a ""you"" issue, if it's in fact not. It might be helpful to understand if the hold up is expressing the feelings (and why) or if the hold up is developing feelings. Maybe it would be helpful to have him explain how the trip factors in, why it will help? Is he concerned about his family rejecting you? Maybe it would help to hear him express the things he admires and appreciates about you, even if he stops short of saying love?   

To be honest, giving this advice feels wrong. I feel like what you're asking could be rewritten as, ""how can I be happy that a reasonable need of mine is not being met after an extended period of time"" - and I'm not sure there's really good advice for that, honestly. I don't think the goal should be to turn yourself into Swiss cheese to try to fit into a relationship."

I thought it went well, it was just an hour or so, but the conversation was decent. She was really cute and seemed nice and I messaged her right afterwards sending my number, but never heard anything back.

Met up later that evening with some friends at a bar for drinks. I was excited about the date and had just finished telling my friend about it when she walked in the bar on a different date with another guy!

datingoverthirty,101r4bz,1672701615.0,Social media and dating misinformation,"I don't know if you think the same, but it seems to me that social media sites are not really into promoting ""real"" dating in general. I have lost count on how many times I have seen stories where one or both partners film each other for reactions on intimate events just for the clicks.

People exaggerate little things to seem more attractive to audiences, make fun of important things, or their partners individual tendencies. The worst thing is when I see those moronic challenges that make me question how humanity is not extinct by now.

People take the frustration out on everybody, frustrated ""gurus"" spread ideas to gain popularity among unsuccessful people(mostly males) in the scene, and there seems to be a lot of revenge/betrayal going on.

I don't have any of those channels that come in these stories followed, but I imagine someone has to follow for those to get promoted(implying there is an algorithm promoting these clips/videos).

The easy way out would be to just not consume it, but that is not the point I am making. There are obviously people consuming it, filling their minds with things that might be very harmful to them and the people around them, not necessarily the ones they are currently dating.

Matched with this woman (35), I‚Äôm 38. It was a bit before Christmas so after some  back and forth and not finding a good good time to schedule a date, I suggested we could set one up after the holidays. She through out the idea that I could come to her NYE party at her place with a couple of her friends. It sounded like a lot, but I didn‚Äôt have plans yet so I figured.. why not? Fast forward to NyE, I text in the early afternoon to confirm our plans. She mentioned her baby (one child) was not feeling well and that she was trying to get her parents to watch him. A couple of her friends flew in (she‚Äôs from PA), so she still had them there since they were staying with her for a few days. I told her to lmk and that I could make other plans if it wasn‚Äôt going to work. She only replied that she did want to meet me but had to tend to baby the last few days. Nothing either confirming or denying. So I made other plans and wrote it off. Mentioned she felt bad for friends that flew in with the sick baby and everything. 

I went to hang with some work friends at their place and all was good. She texted me after midnight saying ‚Äúshould‚Äôve been here!‚Äù. I asked what she meant by that. ‚ÄúI wish you were here‚Äù. That she was ‚Äúnervous with the baby‚Äù. I sort of shrugged like okay.. I would‚Äôve been there had she confirmed anything. 

She suggested Monday the next day, I told her I was working afternoons through Thursday. She then said she thought we stopped talking as much and that it made her sad. Which is ridiculous because I‚Äôve always been the initiator leading up to the potential date. Mentioned she likes to talk to someone she‚Äôs interested in everyday. I thank her for sharing but this was the very next day after she basically cancelled the date. She suggested a Friday afternoon date which I agree to. Some hours go by and she was ‚ÄúI feel like you aren‚Äôt as interested as before!‚Äù I assure her that I isn‚Äôt true and she said maybe her just being exhausted. 

I‚Äôm not a fan of afternoon dates early on but that‚Äôs the plan for now.

**TL;DR:** I met a Tinder date at his participatory art exhibition. He ended up yelling at me and ushering me out in the middle of the experience. I was told I need to be more respectful of people's time.

\_

I liked this guy on Tinder because we're both artists and I thought his art seemed interesting. Normally I like profiles based on the bio only, but in this case I felt that the visual content was speaking enough (in addition to the brief bio), so I made an exception.

Usually I want to exchange some messages before meeting up, to determine initial conversational compatibility. His responses were very limited. A couple words, a full sentence at best. I couldn't get any idea of his personality. But he was extremely busy building an exhibition, so I looked past that and made another exception to my rules when he invited me to see it. I know what it means to be insanely busy, it's how things are sometimes for artists. So I agreed to go see the exhibition, which was open for a limited time only. First I told him I might be able to do it on day X, but then some work stuff happened and I had to completely reschedule everything and was fully booked up until a trip to see my family for Christmas. I communicated this promptly.

The info I had of the exhibition was from its website: opening days, opening hours, free admission, address. A description saying that guests were intended to participate in it and influence the form it would take. Very intriguing, I thought!

At some point he mentioned he was running some equipment that makes it interactive to the visitors, and that he was there all the time. He also said the last day would be a week sooner than it says on the website, which made it a lot harder for me to come up with free time to visit. Upon returning from my trip, I let him know a new date that would work for me, and he said ""I can reserve you the 5:15 slot"". This seemed a bit odd, given that it was free admission and the opening hours were from ten to six pm - there was no mention that guests should have an appointment. I shuffled up my schedule to make that specific time work.

On the day of, I texted to double check we were still on, but received no response until 25 minutes before. The response was something like: ""I didn't think we needed another confirmation, but there are in fact some technical problems I need to take care of. So maybe another day?"" I was already on my way by then, and said so. He said it was okay.

When I got there, the entrance to the building was locked (it's not a normal gallery space, it's on the top floors of a larger building). There was a sign on the door asking guests to call a phone number to see the exhibition. Some guy who was coming out just then let me inside, and I took a lift to the correct floor.

He met me there without greeting me at all, with slightly standoffish demeanor. I thought to myself he must be stressed out about the technical problems. There was no one else there. He explained the layout and the basic structure of the exhibition. He instructed me to first see a short film, then follow him upstairs. When I did, he was sitting behind the equipment desk and said ""since you came up so soon, you can go take a look in the other room over there"", which I did. To me, that comment sounded like ""you came up too early, I'm not ready yet"". So after the other room, I decided to go back downstairs to see the short film again, because it reminded me of the opening scene to my favourite feature film, and I very much enjoyed being immersed in it. I saw him still behind the desk, let him know I'm going back down, and that I'll be back afterwards. There was no response.

When I wanted to go up again, the lift wasn't on my floor. There was a sign on it that said: ""Please use the lift. It's very slow but worth the wait."" So I waited for a while, but it never arrived. There was a staircase, too, so I decided to use it to go upstairs. I reached a glass door, through which I could see my coat hanging in the rack I'd placed it in earlier. The door was locked, and no one seemed to be inside. I took the stairs further up, where one part of the installation was set up. I saw a hatch in the ceiling and a ladder leading up to it, and went to explore if I might be able to open the hatch. No such luck. I then went back down the stairs and double checked that I hadn't missed anything I could use to ""influence the events"". When there wasn't anything, I called the phone number he told me to call in case I needed to reach him.

He replied and said he was coming down. He handed me my coat, told me he closed the exhibition (20 minutes before closing time), and began reprimanding me on how disrespectful I was being of his time, yelling things like ""Care to explain why you disappeared for 20 minutes?"" but then not letting me get a word in edgewise. We got to the exit floor, he ushered me out and slammed the door shut, telling me to learn some manners.

I find the whole thing hilarious, but I'm also a tad spooked that someone could be so harshly critical of me taking my time enjoying his art, and unwilling to discuss in a civil manner. It is now clear to me, in hindsight, that the intended participation was to happen *in the room with the equipment*, not in the other rooms. To him this was clear, of course, but I couldn't have possibly known that when walking in!

\_

This clearly isn't someone I'd like to get to know more, given the explosive temper. I did feel a deep connection to him via the art, and it's a damn shame that things had to happen the way they did. I sent him the following text:

'Hey Name, I wanted to thank you for your time today and apologise for my part in the misunderstanding. Based on the info and opening hours indicated on the website, I was expecting to be able to look around and explore freely. After the fact, it occurred to me that I was intended to participate with the artist, not so much with the exhibition itself like I‚Äôd thought. I wish there would have been a moment to calmly discuss the experience, because I was in fact enjoying myself quite a bit, until I got ushered out the door! I wish you all the best for the new year. Kind regards, Name'

Not expecting a response, moving on. However, I'd love to hear everyone's ideas and suggestions wrt what you guys would have done differently, because in every experience, there is always something to learn.

\_

ETA: I see people asking how come I felt I have to apologise. I don't. It's just how I roll. Whenever I've been a part of a misunderstanding, I take responsibility for my part even when my intent wasn't malicious. What's more, in our country the professional art circles are quite small. It's fully possible that I'll run into him in a work context later on, so it's just the smarter thing to do to make it clear that there are no hard feelings - just to let him save face.","He was rude before and during the date. The only thing you could do different is not going on that date. 
Your bad gut feeling was confirmed when you met him in real life. 

What you could do better is to learn to trust yourself and the vibes you get. I think you are being too sweet in that text to him afterwards, he was basically an ass to you and you sent him such a kind text. 

Perhaps write a bit more with people or even better; have a phone call before the date, I usually do that and it reveals A LOT. 

I think you did your very best and you seem like a kind person that thinks kindly of others, which is a great quality. But also take care of yourself and be in tune with what your body and feelings are telling you."
datingoverthirty,101jx6a,1672684645.0,Doing the work on ourselves and giving grace to others when dating: what's your personal self-care goal for this year?,"I just recently read two Reddit posts that made me think a lot about the things we assume about others when dating. Whether it's us making assumptions about the other person or having assumptions being made about us. For example, a person said they got sick and needed to reschedule. when they contacted their match, the match stopped responding probably thinking they weren't being genuine. Another also involved being busy and needing to reschedule, but the person assumed that the other person had the worst of intentions even though it didn't come across that way for many other users. 

One of the hardest parts about dating can be reigning in those automatic negative thoughts which act to protect us but also serve as a barrier that can prevent us from connecting with other people. In the prior examples, the people involved should have been able to at least meet their matches, but didn't due to assumptions guiding their actions on at least one side. These thoughts can lead to:

* Over-generalizing(""all guys are like"" this or ""if they wanted then they would respond soon"", etc..)

* Catastrophic thinking(""they're using less exclamation marks so they're becoming less interested"" or ""they didn't schedule a date immediately after the last one so they've probably met someone else"" etc..)

* Drawing a selective inference(his body language was tense so he must not be into me)

* Discounting the positive( despite the date going well, she asked to split the check, that's a bad sign)

These types of maladaptive and negative thinking patterns can lead us to personalize experiences even when they have nothing to do with us because we often have incomplete information. They cause us to try and become mind readers. As a result, we put up barriers that stop authentic connections from forming. These experiences compound and become self-reinforcing. The thoughts become even more automatic until we don't even realize they are happening. We treat every new experience like a continuation of the previous one even though every person we date is different and has their own circumstances. 

This isn't to say that we shouldn't be aware of our own patterns when it comes to the people we select or be aloof to mistreatment. Dating begins with self-care.  We can't give grace to others when we aren't willing to give grace to ourselves. **What is your personal self-care goal this year when it comes to dating?**

Mine is to focus more on my hobbies. I dabbled in OLD during the middle part of last year and every time I did, I noticed I became more fixated on that rather than my hobbies and personal relationships. The more I focused on OLD, the less I felt I was spending on caring for myself and other relationships. I notice that when my relationship with myself and others is meaningful, I'm more than willing to give grace in my dating life without even having to think about it.","I want to be more mindful overall while dating. I‚Äôm challenging myself to pay more attention to actions than words, including my own, and to bow out at the first sign that my needs aren‚Äôt being met rather than wait for things to get worse or getting dumped. Boundaries for the win!"
datingoverthirty,101izy8,1672682438.0,How would you react if a guy opened up and became more vulnerable (seeing pyschologist)?,"Hey! 

I was wondering what you think of being more vulnerable. Life was going great but a year ago a emotional scar opened up again that I (M30) never properly dealt with. 

4 months ago I started seeing a psychologist and that has been helping me a lot. It's not something I'm assamed of and I've already told friends and people that I care about. It's nothing crazy but just so that they are aware that I'm sometimes drained.

After watching Brene Brown on netflix and reading her book, see said something along the lines: ‚ÄúThe truth is that most women can‚Äôt stomach it,‚Äù she writes. ‚ÄúIn those moments when real vulnerability happens in men, most of us recoil with fear, and that fear manifests as everything from disappointment to disgust.""

and men fear being vulnerable, which is true as I never liked to talk about these things and just wall up. Basically the societal pressure that showing weakness is bad, 'man-up'. 

Now, I wasn't planning on dumping my entire history on her (F34) but more like: ""Hey apologies if I sometimes feel a bit distanced or avoidant, it's nothing to worry about but I started theraphy to get over a past trauma.""

How would that make you feel? Should I open up more or keep this between friends and family? 

Appreciate any of your insights / experiences in such situations.","Two very important things I‚Äôve learned here a man who‚Äôs spent a lot of time in therapy:

1. Learn to experience the difference between relying on someone else to solve your emotions and sharing your inner life with someone else. This is a thin line lots of men struggle with because we‚Äôre so used to not having any support that we over-rely on our partners. Cultivating closer friendships outside of your partner helps.

2. Honor your emotional life and protect it. Brene Brown is right: a lot of women say they want an emotional guy and then recoil. If a woman recoils from you sharing your inner life, she is not for you. Full stop. You deserve someone who will accept all of you and build a relationship through that emotional connection."
datingoverthirty,101idkd,1672680970.0,What are your biggest revelations about yourself as you've entered your thirties and how has it changed what you are looking for when dating?,"I keep wondering because I think in my mid-20s I was looking for someone who was really like me in terms of mutual interests / and someone who was sensitive like I am. Those relationships tended to be quite volatile. Now that I am older, I find myself pursuing women who are while very warm and caring, also very pragmatic and level. I found these traits really compliment my personality well and make me feel a bit more level myself. I'm also more sure of what values and traits are the most important to me in the other person, and that some overlapping interests, but not completely aligned interests is important to me. I don't want to date someone who is exactly like me in that regard.

I've had enough experience now to realize what traits I would need in someone else to make a lifelong partnership work (which is what I want). I also recognize my strengths as a partner and what I bring to the table, while knowing my own shortcomings. In some ways I just feel really confident in who I am and like who I am because I've taken a lot of time to reflect and grow. 

So my fellow community members, what are your biggest revelations about yourself as you've entered your thirties and how has it changed what you are looking for when dating?","The best thing about dating in your thirties is that most people are looking for something serious, know what they want, and have enough experience to know what doesn‚Äôt work for them.

The worst thing about dating in your thirties is that everyone feels the clock ticking which makes a lot of people hesitant to actually commit to something.

He had the type of profile to suggest he wasn‚Äôt looking for anything serious (without saying it outright). As I am looking for a relationship, when he messaged me one of the first things I asked him on the app was what he was looking for. He responded ‚ÄúI am really wanting to meet new people and find someone I click with and then that‚Äôs me.‚Äù 

He asked me the same question and I told him I wanted an ally, someone to do stuff with ‚Äî a relationship. He said it sounded like we wanted the same things, but it‚Äôs only now I‚Äôm realising he could have meant the ally part and doing stuff together, not the relationship. 

He travels more than anyone I know, and said that he would likely leave the country if he were still single in a year. Through text, he also mentions his love for cuddling quite a bit, which gives me casual vibes. He‚Äôs also charming, attractive, and am sure has no trouble with women.

I don‚Äôt know how much I can expect something stable with this man, and as I‚Äôm quite attracted to him, I figure it‚Äôs best to nip this in the bud sooner than later if we do want different things.

What questions do you ask to truly discern whether someone will be open to a relationship or not?

I realise as I‚Äôm asking this, that I could simply bring this topic up again and explore it with him further. I suppose I worry about drowning initial attraction in serious relationship talk, but maybe that‚Äôs just my old fears talking.

At least right now because I recognize the difference in life experience, maturity, and stages in life between me at 30 and a 23 year old.

Well last night I went to a NYE event and I approached an attractive guy. He ended up telling me he was 23 and I told him I was 30. He had thought I was younger, like 25, because I look younger to most people. He didn‚Äôt care at all about the age gap but I was hesitant. However, I felt that we could have a good time and hang out for NYE and part ways after.

We danced together, talked, and even shared a new years kiss. It was fun and he has turned out to be a really sweet guy. Super respectful towards me and I can tell he‚Äôs really into me because he‚Äôs been texting me all day today and suggesting activities we can do together, as well as asking more about me.

He‚Äôs still in college and working on getting his life and career figured out. Meanwhile I‚Äôve been in my adult career for 3 years and have been looking for someone to have a serious relationship with that would ideally lead to marriage.

If we go on a date I will talk to him about his dating goals like I do with all my dates to make sure we‚Äôre on the same page and not wasting time.

But does this even sound reasonable or am I being dumb? I like him more than I thought I would and we have a lot in common, such as that we don‚Äôt like drinking and prefer to do outdoor or other activities.

Update: I went on the date with him. He was the first one to bring up dating goals. He is interested in a relationship, marriage and family and isn‚Äôt looking to just have fun. We had a lot of fun during our date and he was super sweet. He is already throwing out ideas of what we should do for our next date.

I'd like to hear about *how* anyone else has approached or been approached by a friend, and what you would have done differently, or wish they would have done differently.

Anecdotal: My best guy friend in college and I had a flirty texting relationship for a year or so.

Anyways, we hooked up twice, he ended up not liking me in that way. I was devastated at the time. We ended up drifting apart, and it was for the best. 

A coworker asked me out. He did somewhat of a grand gesture by giving me a small present. I do not see him that way, and I was a bit disappointed that he asked me out after I explicitly told him the day before that I was not looking for a relationship at the moment. Anyways - things are not as friendly as they used to be. But they‚Äôre for the best! 

So honestly: even if they say no, you kind of learn to live on without. And if they say yes, well that‚Äôs pretty cool too.

I work with people, i have family (parents siblings etc) I see a couple times a year, but outside of that there is no-one. All those interactions are pleasant, nice, fun etc. From the outside, anyone looking at me would think I'm a totally normal person. Except, when i leave those groups, its just me. If i work from home for 3 weeks i wont see or speak to another person at all, zero friends at all. Not hyperbole, that is the actual number.

The reason I'm asking, is thay while I'd like to be in a relationship, I'm starting to think I'm just not cut out for human contact. If I cant/dont have any friends is looking for a relationship expecting way more than what is possible?

Note, i HAVE had friends before, large groups of people id hang out with and id also hangout with them individually. So while I at least was capable at one point i just don't have any now (or for the last 5-8 years).","Just wanted to offer my POV, I am 38F and my bf is 42M and he is/was this way when we met. 

I am fairly social, definitely have a handful of friends, family and work friends I meet to visit with or go to events. He has zero friends and all his family lives in another state. We met organically at our work building and I could tell he wasn‚Äôt used to being social, even in our initial interactions of getting to know each other. For instance he spoke very softly and even his vocabulary and sentence structure stuck out as kinda odd. His hobbies and interests were very personal, solitary type activities that I didn‚Äôt know much about so even finding common ground at the start was a bit of a challenge.

But, all this to say we were attracted to each other, enjoyed each others company and I kept an open mind throughout it all and we ended up doing great! All of those quirks at the beginning have ironed out and he even now a year later, will join me at work lunches and family functions and really enjoys himself. He still doesn‚Äôt have any personal friends but not sure he wants any? He is naturally an introvert/loner type I think, at this stage of his life anyway. 

I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything wrong with having a loner type lifestyle, if you are confident and fulfilled in how you are it won‚Äôt scare anyone off.

datingoverthirty,100pflh,1672596780.0,Profile review: 34GQ,"Thanks to everyone for helping with pictures earlier! I finally got onto the apps and... I'm getting very few likes, let alone matches. Single digits, even with the new user boost. Would love some more help.

Bumble and Hinge profiles: [https://imgur.com/a/6pp1dim](https://imgur.com/a/6pp1dim)

Trying to figure out what's potentially turning people off here. Is it the pictures? Mentioning relationship type, or kink, or HRT? Something else? I tried to write things in a way that shows off who I am as a person but doesn't get so hyper-specific as to deter people (e.g., referencing specific shows). Also trying to avoid springing any surprises on people, but perhaps mentioning things like kink and HRT are better left to in-person.

I do have some other pictures I can use ([https://imgur.com/a/wXZ6ZQX](https://imgur.com/a/wXZ6ZQX)), and I'm working on getting some more, but I don't know if that's the issue. I'm listed under non-binary, so it is a smaller dating pool, but this still seems a bit low.

Could switch to female since I'm moving in that direction gender-wise, I suppose, and women-loving women will certainly be a better match than straight women. I haven't yet transitioned publicly, though. I do get noticeably more likes on Her, including from lesbians, just generally not from people that match what I'm looking for.","You've narrowed yourself into quite the box here -- with mentioning ENM, kink, and unfortunately anime/gaming/etc, you're taking bold positions that _will_ turn some people off, but hopefully they're the wrong people anyway... 

There's actually a _lot_ you can do to improve your profile without needing to leave your house at all. Some rough notes:

* Don't list what you're into. Lists are tiring. Elaborate on something specific pulled from those lists. What literary tropes tickle you? What have you been tinkering on? Make me want to match you and talk to you. That caption you have about the Metabolism architectural movement is the best text you have in your profile, it shouldn't be hidden behind a picture. 
* A policy wonk in DC? Color me surprised! You don't need to put that in your profile, it's assumed unless otherwise specified.
* Keep in the volunteering/dinner party stuff. That's good!
* With stating both monogamous _and_ monogamish ENM, you sound wishy-washy between the two. If I'm either of the two camps, I'd be afraid you aren't really committed to what I'm looking for. In a similar vein, remove the disclaimer in your long-term relationship blurb. Also makes you sound wishy-washy.
* Being queer myself on many dating apps, I rarely see people list their position/kink outside of... grindr and maybe tinder. I'd just slash that, it can come up in conversation. If it's _really_ crucial to even the initial stages of a relationship, sure you can keep it, but do know it adds a certain gravity to your profile I'm not sure you're intending to portray.
* Add some pictures of you doing fun things or with other people! Make your life look more enriching. Have some friends help you choose photos where you look your best and look fun to be with.
* Aggressively remove anything generic on your profile. You like good food, exploring cities, and going off the beaten path. You like being dorky, going on adventures, cuddling and watching shows. You're a nerd. Cool, you match the thirty other profiles I just swiped past. I wouldn't be so harsh here if I didn't see the actual salient content hidden in your Hinge photo captions.
* Keep that you're on HRT, mainly as a self-protective move against weirdos out there.

And for your photos... I'll sort into good/meh/bad.

* Good: #1 (good smile, good lighting on your eyes), #6 (full body shot, you look happy), #9 (real smile!)
* Meh: #2 (fit of the suit isn't great), #7 (great composition but you're grimacing/not smiling with your eyes!), #8 (decent fit, meh composition)
* Bad: #3 (you're not smiling with your eyes), #4 (you're in shadow), #5 (you're in shadow)"

I did bring the conversation up too early, at about 4 months, but made clear that it wasn't something I wanted in the near future but I wanted to understand how he felt about it conceptually, to make sure it was something he could see himself doing *eventually* (as he had never lived with a partner before), and to get an idea of what his timeline was (to manage my own expectations). We ended up revisiting the conversation around the 10 month mark and he slowly started moving in around the 11 month mark. We are now past the 13 month mark and he still has his lease for 2 more months, but things have gone well and he's officially given notice at his place.   

At 9 months, I think you should be able to have conversations about ""what does our future together look like?""

(not in a relationship but we both agreed to not see other people) 

Our dating has been on and off since we travelled a lot between (his work and mine and his recent family visit trips) 
Saw each other for 2.5 months early last year (2022) 
Then 5 months hiatus 
Resumed dating back in Aug 2022 which was going great until three weeks ago when he took a trip when I started feeling like he‚Äôs been Mia (less texts and no calls) I assumed it was because of family friends travels etc
This morning gfs sent me bumble photos of him.
He arrives here where I live tomorrow and I meet him in a couple of days 
I need advice on how to approach this conversation 
Do I confront?

*EDIT - Bumble will tell you ‚Äúnew here‚Äù when a new account is created and his description clearly states he is flying back to the place I live so everyone saying his account may not be active, it definitely is.‚Äù

Edit - thanks everyone for your super helpful tips and great advices I‚Äôm really glad that I posted it here.
Bumble profile is fake and he has shown me proof about it. And I trust him. He did all he could to prove that he hasn‚Äôt been on any dating apps since we began seeing each other beginning of last year. Though it hardly matters now. 

I will take in everything everyone wrote as a lesson. 
We didn‚Äôt have enough time with ourselves in a place together to establish things and he came clean about not wanting to string me along or keep me hanging 
We are done and I got my closure, without which, it would have been so much tougher for me to accept this. I‚Äôm really hurt right now that things cannot be what I imagined they would be for the both us together but it only makes me a step closer to finding my person 
And this time for real, I can say I don‚Äôt regret a single thing 
He was honest with me and it couldn‚Äôt be what I hoped it would be. It‚Äôs alright. We all get hurt. 
I hope I find the person who will return me all the love, energy  and effort I put into them. 
And I also hope each one of you don‚Äôt have to go through such heartbreaks. 
Writing this on our last night together.
It‚Äôs been very emotional for me. But thanks everyone.",Time to move on

datingoverthirty,zzzerj,1672508619.0,"Why is dating giving me constant anxiety, no matter what happens?","It's been a few months since I've had an in-person date. Got stood up for the first time last month and it really shook me. So here I am, putting myself out there, and somehow managed to get a date with a beautiful girl who I've been talking to on IG for a few months. She has \*always\* been a sporadic and random texter: messages can be long, or just an emoji, or no response at all. She had given me her # at one point, sometimes she messages from IG, sometimes via text. I mean, this girl is all over the place.

I figured that date would be a total fail as she seemed to be responding sporadically over the last few days. But it turned out to be really good. She was talkative, lively, smiling, asked me lots of questions. The conversation was easy and flowed naturally. After a 2hr dinner, I walked her to her car, gave her a quick hug. She said she hoped we could do it again soon, and I agreed. I left feeling really good... until now.

No matter what happens, the before/after of a date is just constant anxiety. I catastrophize leading up to it, then during the date I'm usually calm and relaxed. Afterward, I ride a rollercoaster of ""what ifs"" and can't seem to chill. It makes me feel like it's not worth it. I texted her late last night saying I got home safe (she asked me to), had a good time, etc. It's barely afternoon the next day and she hasn't responded. I realize that she's not communicating any differently than she did before the date, only now I'm having extreme anxiety, analyzing her social media posts, ughhghghghgh.

Reading the above, I sound ridiculous. I know what I need to do, I need to feel good that I had a great dinner in a great restaurant in a city I don't get to visit often. And leave it at that. I need to stay busy living my life, and if something comes of this, it will. But that's easier said than done.","You need to calm down your thoughts, if you both vibe well it is definitely going to work out but staying calm and taking care of your mental health must be a priority.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I've decided to get back out there, and do some dating. I moved from a huge city to a medium sized city a few months ago for work. I'm fairly settled in now and in a good place to pursue a relationship. 


I'm sure my profile could use improvements, and I was hoping to hear your thoughts so that I can make it better. I've been on Hinge for a week or so, and haven't had any matches, unfortunately. I assume that means there's something wrong with either the profile or with me as a person, and I'm hoping it's the former. 


I am 5'10, have no kids, no pets, live alone, vaccinated, employed, and have a post-grad degree. I like guitar, weightlifting, tech, longboarding, rock climbing, and a variety of entertainment media (tv, music, books, movies).


I drink sometimes, no cigarettes, and smoke pot sometimes.

*Edit: I removed my profile links*

Thanks!","I'm a straight guy, so take my advice with a grain of salt, but I'd suggest some different pictures of you smiling while looking at the camera."
datingoverthirty,zyrrk0,1672377088.0,Is this a sign of a scammer?,"I've had two men do this from chatting on an online dating site. They contact me and are very polite and formal. We chat a bit and they want to move to an app or exchange phone numbers. The first man I'm sure was a scammer because he said he grew up in Thailand but when his parents died in a car crash when he was 7, he went to live with his grandparents in Russia - but when we spoke on the phone he sounded very African and not at all Russian. I just stopped responding to him. 

The second guy had an American accent, but every time we'd try to video chat, his video wouldn't work and he'd accuse me of turning mine off. He wanted to talk a lot about investing (first red flag) and said his goal was to buy a house with whoever he found to be his life partner - in January (yes, this January). 

Both men categorized themselves as widowed, no kids, and both men seemed to always have some excuse about why they couldn't meet me in person despite being in the same city. I try to meet in person quickly to see if there's actually a connection since I've been surprised both ways (someone I felt meh about virtually but actually really liked in person and vice versa). I had my back up with both of these guys almost immediately and paid attention to that. I'm pretty sure they were both scammers. What other ploys do you see on the online dating platforms that reek of scammers?

I was so disappointed as my last go-around with online dating in July resulted in a quick match and I dated him for a few months and really liked him until it ended in mid-November. I was hoping to repeat that!","Yes I would guess they‚Äôre scammers unfortunately. The unwillingness to meet up in person, video chat not working is a good indicator. Trying to move you off the app quickly can also be a sign. The good thing is you noticed it quickly and have managed to avoid them!"
datingoverthirty,zyoaxm,1672367069.0,Solo parent - hope after a break tip?,"The guy (38M) I‚Äôve (36F) been seeing for 8mo told me today he‚Äôs been doing some soul searching and now that I have full parenting time (of one young elementary aged kid) his ‚Äúheart isn‚Äôt 100% into it‚Äù and he‚Äôs thought about the life he wants and ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt it.‚Äù

We had been working on plans to meet each other‚Äôs kids soon so this cut pretty deep. 

He‚Äôs got the standard high level professional suburban single Dad package - 50/50 parenting time of two elementary aged kids with a reliable even if not easy to get along with coparent, high earner with plenty of disposable income and tons of vacation time for travel and a very accommodating flexible work schedule. I think he just prefers that lifestyle which is fine but that‚Äôs not the life I have. 

It‚Äôs just very disappointing because I was 100% into it and thought it was moving forward something long term. 

Full parenting time (no visitation) is new for me as of a few months ago, previously had 50/50, but he‚Äôs been in the loop every step as things have changed the last few months, so this isn‚Äôt new information. 

I‚Äôm glad he told me before we met kids (that would have been a first for both of us) but it still hurts. My kid is always going to be #1 (and not in the dating profile ‚Äúmy baaaaby is my whole wooooorld way‚Äù, but like a responsible loving parent way) and I certainly don‚Äôt want to be in a relationship with someone who isn‚Äôt interested and enthusiastic about eventually integrating our kids into the mix. 

I‚Äôve dated on and off over the last few years and the prior two guys (a couple to a few months each) didn‚Äôt have kids and ultimately broke up with me because our lives were too different. 

I‚Äôd like to find something long term eventually, not looking to have more kids of my own but open to a partner‚Äôs kids. 

I don‚Äôt even know how the logistics of solo parent dating are going to work because I‚Äôve never done it from the start but I know eventually I will want to get back out there

Anyone else been in this situation and eventually found a good match or have any word of advice or encouragement?.","Best advice I can think of: have a thick skin. You are going to face a lot of rejection. I also have 50/50 custody and I pass on women with full custody (and ones with 50/50 if our schedules are poorly aligned). It's just too challenging to find time together unless the kids are a lot older, but often then they aren't interested in me because my little one is... little. It's not a judgment against you, though. It's a recognition of an incompatibility, so you can't attempt to own someone else's rejection as necessarily a fault on your end.

Get solid child care. Since the one you have full time is little as well, you can't leave them alone (probably) for long periods of time, so you will need to rely on child care often to date. Maybe that's another kid of yours if they are old enough, or a babysitter.

When you plan dates, make sure they are things you'd be happy to do alone if it came to it. We should *all* do this, but especially if you need to get child care. If you go through getting ready and getting childcare and they bail, you need to still be happy to go do whatever solo and have a good time."

Our date isn‚Äôt until next week, but he‚Äôs been messaging me and has said things like, ‚Äúsee you then, beautiful‚Äú or ‚Äúlooking forward to it, lovely.‚Äù 

I have been burned by shitty men/relationships in the past. I am now very cautious, and I am looking for a genuinely good guy, but I also intend to move *very* slowly to ensure that when I am interested in someone, they are also interested in pursuing a relationship with me as well.

That being said, some of my experience is with men love-bombing me and making me feel like they are really interested very early on, then bailing once they get what they want. So him using these words when we have not gone on a date yet is bothering me but I don‚Äôt know if I am making a big deal out of nothing. Any thoughts?

Now that I know my negative status I‚Äôm unsure about how to proceed in potentially sleeping with new partners. I understand that this testing isn‚Äôt part of a standard STI panel. Is there anyone who requests this specific test of new partners before unprotected sex? It seems like a lot to ask since one has to go out of their way to get tested. Just curious if anyone has taken this approach and how they go about it. 

FWIW, I would have no issues sleeping with someone with HSV2 who is taking antivirals, but I worry about contracting it from someone who doesn‚Äôt know they have it. Is dealing with this uncertainty just part of dating and having sex for most people?","Tests for HSV are unreliable without an active outbreak anyways.

datingoverthirty,zyc26c,1672337652.0,Am I being love-bombed?,"I \[30M\] have been talking to a woman \[35F\] for about a week. 

The chemistry is there. How I asked her out was super dorky, awkward, and cute. A snowstorm kept us from meeting last week but it's finally happening tomorrow. 

I have told her so much about me that I feel mentally naked. We know so much about each other in such a short amount of time. We talked on the phone for 3 hours of amazing conversation . She calls me ""babe"" sometimes and sends me good morning texts. She talks of our movie nights and what we'll be doing in the future and I have to remind myself that we haven't even met yet. I have avoided the pet names at all costs.

The worst part about all of this is knowing that if tomorrow doesn't go well, this will all go away in a heartbeat. So I'm just waiting to see how we vibe in person and if things go well, I am so in. It's actually pretty scary as to how much I like her already. 

Am I being love-bombed or am I just being too cautious? She's well established (owns a home) and doesn't strike me as the type who would need me. Talking to her his past week has been insane.","I don't think she's love bombing, but she might be romanticizing the relationship"
datingoverthirty,zy9idz,1672331436.0,Have you ever had to end a friendship to protect your relationship?,"I'm 31F currently in a relationship with 29M and some of my friends say I may need to cut off 40M whom I consider a genuine friend.

29M and  I dated before, broke up and now have been officially together for about 3 months. It's great. He treats me well and I've gotten over my initial discomfort re dating someone outside my race. We take trips abroad together and all in all are moving at a healthy pace.


40M is technically an ex. We dated for about 5 or 6 months about 3 years ago. After he failed to DTR, I ghosted. Not proud to have done that but being transparent. In fact, in our short stint dating, I ghosted him twice and shortly after the second time I moved abroad for a while and we were no contact for several months. Once I unblocked him, he did apologize for things that happened between us.


Fast forward to present day and we've become genuine friends. We work for the same organisation (in different departments) and since I returned we ended up doing a lot of projects together which made us get to know each other in a completely platonic way. He supports my private endeavours. He helps me whenever I need help with whatever and we communicate often, typically starts out due to work but then gets personal. If I had to give him a label, I would say he's become my male best friend. We absolutely do not cross any lines in our friendship.


The problem is that since I started dating... things have changed a bit in very subtle ways. Case in point, he's sent a video of a man saying males and females can't be friends and the male is usually just waiting on an opportunity.  There are other subtle behaviour that have made me raise an eyebrow. He knows about and seems to support my relationship. However, at least 90% of my platonic male friends have confessed feelings for me in the past and ruined our friendship. My history with this particular friend makes me even more wary. 

Should I consider ending this friendship to protect my relationship or is there a better way to handle this situation?","The video thing of men and women alone would make me consider ending it.

That said all of my female friends have said stuff that I‚Äôd call questionable. One told me that she dreamed that we had sex. She has no filter so I excused it for that reason, and she seems truly happily married. We never dated etc. and she has (edit) not repeated or ramped that up. 

Another said this vague statement about how a guy can know her better than her own husband. I made a non committal statement, but hanging out with her has become almost zero since then.

I know this is just an observation, it's possible they paused their account and deleted the app.  

I'm assuming women have similar experiences with men, and seeing the same people appear on their search feeds on the apps long-term. 

Is the success rate for OLD really that bleak for women and men? 

*Note - I'm not bashing the people because I'm single, and I can't say that OLD has always been all that great. I've met some great people but things unfortunately didn't pan out as I had hoped. It happens.","When I last used OLD halfway seriously, it was match.com.  Instead of it being just one profile at at and swipe like everything else is, you could set your search parameters and see all the profiles that hit these parameters. Then you could ‚Äúsort by‚Äù and one of those sorting options was by ‚Äúlast activity‚Äù.  You even then saw indicators for like ‚Äúonline now‚Äù, ‚Äúonline in the last 24 hours‚Äù ‚Äúonline in the last week‚Ä¶last month‚Ä¶3 months‚Äù (I think it went to 3 months) and then just the rest with no designation. 

So, in my experience, I could put in my search parameters, get let‚Äôs say, 80 profiles that met the search, sort by activity, and mayyyyyyyybe 8 profiles were ‚Äúonline in the last week‚Äù or sooner. Another 5-6 would be in the last month. And the rest were either 3 months or older.   I learned pretty quick that there was little reason to even bother looking past the first 10 or so profiles when sort by new because those were all gonna be users who left or found someone or whatever the fuck.

Also I‚Äôd read the profiles of those 8-10 recent activity ones, find maybe 2-3 that I could see in their profile that seemed like there was a commonality I could use as a talking point in my first message, send said message, get no replies, repeat every other day until I realized I was going to die alone forever and it was pointless to keep making match.com executives more wealthy. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
datingoverthirty,zxxr5u,1672294335.0,Am I just paranoid and insecure or is something else going on?,"I (F36) was scrolling through Instagram when I decided to look at the accounts that my boyfriend (M40) of about 8 months was following. When we first started dating I had briefly skimmed his profile and who followed him, but I‚Äôm not a huge social media user so I didn‚Äôt investigate further. What I found made me very uncomfortable and I can‚Äôt tell if it is because I was cheated on in my previous relationship or not.

First, I saw that he follows a lot of fitness models. Muscle-y girls lifting weights and showing off their abs and ass. I know he is attracted that body type, and I‚Äôve been told I have it too (I have a huge problem with body dysmorphia that I‚Äôm always working on). As I looked more, I realized that 25-50% of the 650-ish people he follows are some kind of ‚Äúfitness model‚Äù whose feed is about 50% softcore porn. Some of the accounts were set to private, which could be totally normal, but I know that a lot of porn accounts are set to private and some of the avatars looked similar to the girls that my ex was chatting with him cheating on me with. 

It freaked me out, so I kept scrolling and looking at the accounts to see if I was wrong. I was trying to prove to myself that it wasn‚Äôt as many accounts as I thought, and that the account weren‚Äôt that bad, but the more I looked, the worse it looked. So I scrolled all the way down in his ‚Äúfollowing‚Äù list to see if it was just a weird pattern in the algorithm.

I came across the account of a woman who, based on her bio and what I know about her, is obviously his most recent ex-girlfriend. She‚Äôs got that fitness model vibe and her avatar is a photo of her showing off her abs. So he is following a bunch of scantily clad women and his ex-girlfriend (dunno if she is scantily clad because her account is set to private).

He lived with her at some point. According to him, she was abusive, hit him, they had a very volatile relationship, etc. I‚Äôve had some of this corroborated through comments from his family, so I think he‚Äôs telling the truth about how awful she was. But even though they broke up a few years ago, when he and I first started dating, he had some of this woman‚Äôs very personal property (can‚Äôt tell you what or it would make the story too easily identifiable, but it wasn‚Äôt nefarious or sexual, just something very important that she would want stored nearby), stored at his one bedroom apartment. He told me that he thought she had left it on purpose because she would want to wiggle into a relationship with him again at some point. He also said that she told him that she needed to leave it because she and her new boyfriend, now, husband, we‚Äôre looking to buy a house and didn‚Äôt have enough room in her apartment to keep it (I call bullshit because the items could fit in about 3-4 cubic feet of space). When I asked him about it further, he also said that he did not want to deal with communicating with her ever again, and that is why he didn‚Äôt ask her to come get it when we started dating. Fairly recently we had an argument about trust and boundaries, and I brought up my discomfort with him, keeping the stuff stored at his place and a few weeks after that I was able to convince him that I really meant it and that it really bothered me and he called her to go pick up her stuff. He kept reiterating how much he didn‚Äôt like her, how mean she was, and how much she didn‚Äôt want to deal with her.

So why is he following her on Instagram? I can‚Äôt think of any reason that makes me feel comfortable. Same for the question of why he is following so many booty fitness models. I feel flashes of PTSD from when I was cheated on, sure, but it also just feels gross and disrespectful. I also feel very insecure about my body, even though I objectively know there is nothing wrong with it.

So now I‚Äôm lying awake in bed and I can‚Äôt sleep and I‚Äôm just stressing out over what all this means and how to talk to him about it. We are also supposed to go on a two day trip a few hours out of town. I was looking forward to this trip, and I was in a place to feeling secure and happy in our relationship, but now I just feel sick.

Are any of these feelings reasonable? How can I deal with them? How can I talk with him about this? How can I move forward regardless of what it all means?

Using a throwaway.","> I was looking forward to this trip, and I was in a place to feeling **secure and happy in our relationship**, but now I just feel sick.

Girl, in your comments you say he has ""an explosive anger problem"" and told you to ""fuck off"" or ""go fuck yourself"" when you tried to have a calm conversation about your concerns.

Instagram accounts aside, this sucks.  A tragic backstory about his abusive ex does not make it cool for him to audition for the role of YOUR abusive ex.

The fact that he's in therapy and **still** behaving like this should have you *running for the door.*

ETA: As to how to talk to him, send him a text ""As much as I care for you as a person, I do not care to pursue this further or see you again.  Please respect my decision and do not contact me again.""  Then immediately block him everywhere."
datingoverthirty,zxtc1l,1672281735.0,"Men - At first, are you trying to win her over or find out if she‚Äôs right for you?","I was listening to a podcast earlier today and a guest mentioned something interesting about behavior he‚Äôs exhibited in the past and that he sees pretty commonly(particularly in those who are avoidant). The podcast host said he also did it a lot in his 20s. I‚Äôm curious to know if this resonates with any of you currently, or if you exhibited this behavior in the past. 

The gist was:
Men will go on dates and put their energy into trying to win over the woman without self checking if this woman is right for them. 

You‚Äôll ‚Äúget over the woman‚Äôs wall,‚Äù make her feel safe, and once she communicates that she likes you, then you actually start the process of investigating if she‚Äôs actually a good match for you. 

Essentially, a man is into the idea of a this woman liking him without asking himself if she‚Äôs actually a fit and if she‚Äôs the women he wants to like him in the first place. 



If you used to do this, curious to know what clicked for you that made you change your approach? If you think you might do this currently, is there a reason you can point to? 

It was an interesting point because it did align with some behavior I clocked early on in my 20s, recognizing the men who were pretty much out purely for the game of trying to get a woman to ‚Äúgive in‚Äù to something she didn‚Äôt initially want (e.g if she only wants a hookup, try to convince her to want a relationship and vice versa). I think what this guy is explaining is less intentional/malicious, but still lends to the same outcome of the person feeling manipulated and bait/switched.",[deleted]

datingoverthirty,zxilfj,1672255925.0,Moving closer to ldr,"So I've been in a long distance relationship for about 8 months now and my partner is getting ready to move to new state for work. I would like to move closer to her for our relationship and really like the place she is moving to. I can move pretty freely due to the nature of my work. She likes this idea however is supper hesitant about having me move just for her. I've tried to explain I'm ready for some where new to live and would rather be closer to her than further. We're not looking to get a place together but separate homes. I feel like she's putting alot of of pressure on herself about be moving there. 

I understand it is alot of pressure however its also my own choice to move there as well. Also it's hard for me not to see this as a Yellow flag for the relationship If she's scared of the idea of moving closer.","My guess is she's already anxious about ~herself~ having to move, so you following her is just going to pile on even more anxiety.  Do yourself a favor and back off the subject for now.  Let her move and get settled first.  Instead of trying to brush aside or downplay her concerns, let her know you understand her hesitation at having to manage both moving, her job possibly changing ~and~ stepping up your relationship at the same time.

Basically she's expressed a worry and respecting that right now is a slam dunk for the future of the relationship.  Listen, understand, be compassionate.  You're looking for someone to spend the next 40+ years of your life with, you can weather another 4~5 months of long distance before bringing it up again."
datingoverthirty,zxgnr6,1672251424.0,Should I actively discourage oversharing on a first date?," I say ‚Äúoversharing‚Äù without really understanding where the line is between someone being open with me and emotional dumping. By default I‚Äôm pretty open to most topics but am now wondering if it‚Äôs a problem.

After many first dates I‚Äôm starting to notice a trend: quite often, guys will share deep personal details and fairly raw self-reflections with me that I suspect they don‚Äôt share with many other people in their lives. Things like family drama, traumatic experiences, breakup baggage, existential angst, nuanced political views etc. In some cases I‚Äôve even witnessed them working through fresh realizations in that moment as they‚Äôre sitting in front of me. 95% of these dates are via apps, btw.

On the surface this has never seemed like a bad thing: I find these kinds of conversations interesting, it‚Äôs good to know that they‚Äôre capable of reflection and intimacy, and in theory you‚Äôd think it would be a good way of connecting with another person. Also I would assume that if someone is comfortable getting into their deep dark stuff with me, the date is going okay.

But here‚Äôs where I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs a bad thing:

1. Guys who get into deep sharing territory seem to be more likely to ghost or slow fade before a second date. It gives me a bit of whiplash because these are usually the same guys who voice their eagerness for a second date while still on the first.
2. Relating to the first point, I feel a bit like a therapist rather than their date. If I‚Äôm into them and we‚Äôre going to continue getting to know each other, great. But over the course of many dead-end first dates it gets exhausting and feels like work. If I‚Äôm being honest I sometimes feel a bit used, emotionally.

Some additional context: creating a space where people feel comfortable sharing their intimate personal experiences and non-judgementally listening to what they have to say is what I do professionally. I suspect that many of the things that serve me well at work bleed over into my personal interactions and have something to do with why dates tend to get emotionally intimate so early. But because it‚Äôs second nature, I don‚Äôt know how to turn it off. The people I work with sometimes share things that start crossing an ethical boundary, and I have tools for managing those situations in a work context. But those tools for managing disclosure don‚Äôt translate well to a date interaction. For example I can‚Äôt have them read a legal notice reminding them of the bounds of the interaction, because that would be‚Ä¶ weird.

So guess my questions for you all are these: 

Is getting deep on a first date problematic? Any experiences from men who have shared deeply and then felt negatively or positively about it and why would be particularly helpful

What are some tactics for keeping things light but not shutting down future intimacy?","You are not alone in this experience! I actually posted a thread on it earlier this year, I called it ""the oversharing phenomenon"". I tried a lot of different tactics when I'd run into this, and here is where I ultimately landed:

1. If they are oversharing about sexual stuff, it's an automatic no from me (see my post for what I mean). This to me signals poor social skills and when I tried to work with it and set boundaries about it, it never got better. These men were too far outside of my range of compatibility.
2. If they were oversharing about other stuff like past relationships, family stuff, etc, I would usually let it happen and see if they'd hit a natural point where they realized they were maybe telling me too much for a first date. Sometimes that happened, and I think it was good to leave room for the guy to just be human and realize he'd gotten lost in the moment. If he didn't realize, I would say something like ""would you be okay if we left this sort of detail for later dates when we know each other better?"". They'd always agree but only sometimes would abide.
3. If I had to keep setting oversharing boundaries, it became a no from me. Boundary whack-a-mole is exhausting and it seemed to signify this guy had poor boundaries himself, or no coping skills, or no other systems of support. 
4. I learned to stop viewing oversharing and ""getting deep"" on the first date as a green flag. I used to crave this and thought it meant the guy was comfy with me and definitely interested. You and I both know that's not true :) so when it did happen I would actually realize this was a potential yellow flag and that I should prepare myself for him fading/ghosting after."

I‚Äôm getting anxious. Where do we go from here?,"I met this guy and all our dates have been incredibly amazing. He‚Äôs the guy that I would love to have a long-term relationship and I really like him. everything about him fits with the kind of life I imagine. He‚Äôs kind and fun. We hung out on the weekends for a month and then he left to travel the world. He said he doesn‚Äôt expect exclusivity from me so early and would expect that I‚Äôd be seeing other people. The thing is I did go on a few dates after him but I don‚Äôt like anyone as much and I wanna build something with him and see how things go. But he‚Äôs gone and I don‚Äôt know how to continue dating him. He texts me whenever he can. I don‚Äôt know if he‚Äôll continue to do that. Also I have a big fear of rejection so I am pulling away a bit and I‚Äôm only talking to him when he initiates.

REdit - he‚Äôs gone for a month and he texts a little bit to make sure I don‚Äôt feel disconnected. It‚Äôs only been a week since he left so I don‚Äôt know how it‚Äôs gonna be. He talks about stuff we should do after he‚Äôs back, like places to try etc. , but my heart is so scared.","I'll just address one piece of your post - I did and have done so many things in my life to avoid rejection. Sometimes, I succeed and avoid rejection. Sometimes, I get rejected anyway. Every single time, I have felt the sting/pain of rejection, and every single time, that pain has passed. But everything I did to avoid rejection, I have regretted, and the pain of regret has *never* passed.

Regret hurts more than rejection.

Basically, pulling away should be done because it is the rational, right thing to do, where you have done your part, and he isn't doing his. It shouldn't be done as a rejection defense mechanism."
datingoverthirty,zxam5i,1672236945.0,Dating someone super busy: what was your experience with this? Good? Bad?,"I‚Äôve always told myself I have no interest in dating someone super busy. I work a straightforward 9 to 5, with vacation time, good work life balance, and I was looking for the same.

Well life happened, I met someone, we‚Äôve been seeing each other for a couple months now. But they are SO BUSY. I like a lot of things about them, but I don‚Äôt know if I can handle dating someone like this.

They work 10-11hr days, they have very little vacation, they think it‚Äôs acceptable to answer work things after hours, they sometimes get called into last minute things with clients (outside work hours). They also have a shit ton of friends, family, etc. There isn‚Äôt a single day of the week where they‚Äôre just home. They‚Äôre always out somewhere with someone, usually fitting 2 different social things in one day.

Now. I‚Äôm not gonna tell an adult how to live their life. Good for them, have fun. But I don‚Äôt know if *I* can deal with it.

My two pet peeves, involving this situation, is that a) they usually show up late when they do make plans and b) they make plans by saying ‚Äúlet me wait till it‚Äôs closer to Saturday so I can confirm the details‚Äù. Which leaves me always waiting till two days before to even know what‚Äôs going on.

They really, truly seem very interested. We‚Äôve started texting a lot more, they‚Äôre very sweet, and we seem like a good match on paper (goals, values, lifestyle). It‚Äôs just that that‚Äôs how they treat everyone in their life. The last minute plans, the always a bit late, the needed to check work stuff. To them, this lifestyle is just normal.

If you dated/date a busy person, how did that turn out? Was it a disaster? Did they improve later? Was it worth it? Terrible?

Any advice is much appreciated.

Who said anything about me wanting a rich husband?? I make 150-190k a year and im a lesbian. Please stop projecting your issues onto my post. Jesus.","Personally i couldn't deal with this. I had a very busy boyfriend in the past who worked 12 hour days and it didn't turn out well. 
My friend for example married someone like you're describing. Their courtship was a bit lonely for her I think because he was never home and she spent most of her free time alone as he was out socializing. Now that they're married he expects her to socialize with him just as intensely, to the point that she's exhausted because every single week night and weekend they have engagements. I haven't seen her in 6 months. I dunno. Draw your own conclusions.
Edit: I haven't seen her in 6 months because she's picked up the charming habit of never setting up dates at specific times, just saying ""I'll have to see my schedule when it's closer to that time"". This is disrespectful to me tbh and I never follow up. When she reaches out with ""can you meet in 2 hours"" the answer is usually no. I value my free time and plan it so I can enjoy it."

datingoverthirty,zx3ho6,1672212525.0,Red flag? Am I overthinking this?,"A very good friend of mine (33F) has set me up with a guy (38M). She wanted me to meet him for a while and it finally happened tonight. The three of us had dinner and watched a movie. It turned out that he was actually very fit & good-looking and he came across as polite & easygoing. At one point I even felt this person was a bit ""out of my league"" in terms of physical attractiveness. 

However there was a language barrier between us. Some sign language and my friend being the translator helped with the communication but perhaps this was why I didn't feel a strong connection right away. 

After my friend left, I drove him home. He began to tell me more about his life. He's new to the country and is currently on a student visa. He wants to get his permanent residency and a lawyer told him ""only 3 ways - marriage, going back to school or sponsorship"". Immediately I started having questions in my head. I don't want to make assumptions about people I hardly know but part of me couldn't help but think, this could all be part of a strategy to get PR?

I dropped him off and he mentioned to text him when I'm free again. My friend also texted me to see ""what I thought of him"".  He seemed eager but I'm debating if I should pursue this. Am I overthinking that he might be looking for a marriage of convenience?","Ignoring the question about marriage of convenience, are you interested in him at all? Your short list of things that were good was ""he looks good, he's polite, he's easy going."" What are you looking for in a partner and is he meeting that?  Are you okay with needing a translator to communicate well with him?

Your concern isn't necessarily unwarranted. Seems like an odd comment to make if it's not something regularly on his mind. However, your first priority should be whether or not you two are actually compatible and able to connect with one another in a meaningful way. If not, your concern is unnecessary because you two aren't compatible anyway."

I moved out of home six months ago after getting myself a high paying job that allowed me to live by myself. During that time I've been figuring out what I like and getting all my crap together, my social life however is kinda garbo.

I used to roll with furries, and if you know anything about them, well the community wasn't healthy for me (value misalignment really). So I dropped out of it. Recently I've been hanging out on the Melbourne meetup discord and went to an orphans picnic in the city, which was fun, everybody devoured the food I brought since I'm a pretty damn good cook.

I do archery once or twice a week, and once a month I do a military simulation laser skirmish in the deep woods with 30 other guys.

But i honestly only hang out with somebody, in a friend sense for catching up or lunch. Two or three times a year, you won't find anybody that had a problem with me, but nobody really knows me. I'm just wondering how people would feel about my situation.","I never had many friends, and I have slowly lost my social circle since getting out of college.

Fortunately, it‚Äôs never been an issue in my dating life. I have hobbies like the gym, golfing and hiking so I keep myself occupied. I‚Äôm also super close with my family, and look after my parents as they are retired.

I think it‚Äôs one thing to have no friends, it‚Äôs another to have no life. I‚Äôve always been more of a lone wolf type, but I have hobbies I enjoy, a high-paying job that allows me to do those things, and family that is a great support system.

On the fourth date, we were at his apartment and things went to the bedroom and he could not get it up. This was the first time we tried being intimate. Then the rest of the night he seemed upset and not mentally in the present moment, like something was on his mind.

datingoverthirty,zwjzjf,1672159682.0,First date expectations?,"Had a bit of an odd experience lately of a date being cancelled because according to her.. I didn't put in enough effort to plan the date. 

This is through online dating, we chatted for a few days, I got her number and asked if she wanted to meeting up.
We had talked about meeting, and she mentioned liking coffee and walks.
So planned to meet up for a walk and get coffee afterwards, I had asked was there a particular coffee shop she liked (I don't drink coffee myself) and asked when worked for her.
She said I should decide since I asked her out.. so I said ok let meet here at time X. Figuring ok we'll go for a walk.. then get coffee something like that.

Few hours later she says she no longer wants to meet because I didn't put in enough effort and she expects more from someone to plan a date if they ask her out.

This seems a bit much to me seeing as we've never met in person and as I see it this is just a chance to chat and get to know each other better.

I am way off base planning simple things for a first date to have the opportunity/focus of getting know each other?
Should I be doing more for a first meeting? 
What are you expectations for a first date/meeting with online dating?

Edit: It was a walk around center of city early in the day lots of coffee shops around so I just figured we stop at one along the way.

Might just be cultural or preference as mentioned but probably a mismatch between us regardless ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Thanks for the responses!

Edit 2: from reading through comments going forward I'll likely change my approach.

I generally care very little what we to, I just want to meet and get to know them better.

So I have always asked questions trying to determine when/where/what they would like to do. I thought of this as considerate but sounds like this is coming across more as low effort/annoying/off putting.

So instead I'll suggest something and then give them the option to agree or to offer alternatives at that point.","I don‚Äôt think you did anything wrong but you consider these things as a sign of incompatibility and shrug like ‚Äúfair enough‚Äù. I know a lot of women often get the ball batted to them in terms of planning setting up a date and I‚Äôm often left stunned that my bare minimum (ok, I‚Äôve booked this bar for 7) is often met with some variation of ‚Äúthis makes a change, they usually want me to pick somewhere‚Äù. Again, I think what you did was fine, you sought her input and preference and made a suggestion on that basis but it seems like you were hoping to stumble across a coffee place as opposed to figuring out which one. If that wasn‚Äôt enough for her? Then fine. Not sure how much dating you‚Äôve done but I assume it‚Äôs enough to know that not everyone will have these requirements exactly but do prefer the guy to set something up.

datingoverthirty,zwhs25,1672153888.0,Boundaries or unrealistic expectations,"I‚Äôve been seeing a lot of posts about early dating (less than 2 months) and people setting ‚Äúboundaries‚Äù about communications and dating. For example, I‚Äôve seen the following:
 - not seeing someone for a second date because they didn‚Äôt remember their birthday;
- being upset that the person is not prioritizing them over their friends and family over the holidays; and
- being upset that the communication is going down because of the holidays.

Conversely, I‚Äôve also seen posts where people in the same two month period are introducing kids, spending Christmas with families together, and planning vacations together.

Is there an expectation that we just jump full on into relationship mode after just meeting someone at our age? Is it an acceptable boundary to be upset if it‚Äôs not this automatic relationship mode or is it just unrealistic expectations that shouldn‚Äôt ruin a good start to a relationship?","The problem I see it that boundaries and expectations are being confused or interchanged. Boundaries are something you set for yourself,  you decide what is acceptable to you, and walk away when it is not to your liking. Expectations are something you put on others, actions or characteristics you expect in another person. By laying down all of this too early,  you don't get to see the other person in their true form, they could be trying to present themselves to match what they think you want.

When is it too early for it to feel like work? Should there be a honeymoon period first that kind of helps you build up a strong base for when the work is needed? 

There were never sparks/butterflies but I was trying for a slow burn. (Sparks DO NOT mean toxicity for me.) Character and commitment wise, he was probably the best guy I've ever dated. Truly committed to his friends, family, community, stable job, consistent and kind and committed to me, etc.

Both of us were pretty depressed/anxious/stressed with work, so spending time together felt challenging. the fridge was empty, neither of us were comfortable at each other's places, co-working together was typically a mess due to volume levels, a lack of space, and our work and sleep schedules were off by 4 hours. I was coming off a 6 year relationship, and pretty scared of getting trapped again.

Physically, it felt like every time we had sex I was leading a workshop. I appreciated his interest in making it a good experience for me, but it also felt like it became the focus and so I was always teaching rather than enjoying. The kissing was bad too... so I didn't really want to kiss or linger in bed.

We never actually effectively communicated about either issue, and there just wasn't enough lust to power through the above issues. He began testing me in various ways and interpreting everything the worst possible way. This led to lots of fights and I ended things.

What kept me in it for six months was the fact that he really was perfect on paper. But it felt like we would have been in ""working on it"" mode from the beginning. There's nothing to be reopened here - he's moved on - but I need to put this question to bed in my own mind. Is it fair to end something just because it should be easy and fun in the beginning? Do you NEED a honeymoon phase?

tl;dr I feel like the first part of the relationship needs to be easy and exciting. But it seems like so much dating advice I read is anti-sparks, pro slow-burn and ""building"" something together. If it feels like work from beginning, does that mean you're not a match?","TBH, even after the honeymoon phase is over you should still want to kiss your partner!

We just spent Christmas Eve and Christmas together where we cooked dinner together and breakfast. We played cards. We watched movies and had an exceptional time. The thing is- we haven‚Äôt defined the relationship. We haven‚Äôt had the ‚Äúexclusive‚Äù talk or asked what each other has wanted but we did talk about traveling together and we booked a trip to Mexico for my birthday in March.

IMO you should stop ignoring your own needs because you don't want to be seen as rushing the question. What you want is to know where your relationship stands. That is perfectly valid and an empathetic partner will be willing to understand that.

The way to find out is to ask. If he wants to be in a committed relationship with you then you'll know right away where you stand or where he sees your relationship going.  Also, if he's secure then he's going to listen and not be afraid to commit if he is ready for that commitment. At the very least, he won't beat around the bush the way someone with say an avoidant style might. 

If worst comes to worst, then you know and you can begin moving forward and finding someone who can give you the kind of relationship you want.  You can take charge of your Mexico trip by still going at some point, but inviting some close friends so you can enjoy yourself. On the other hand, if you stay in this relationship and he isn't looking for something then you're just wasting time when you could dating someone who can give you the relationship that you're looking for."

I (30F) have gone out with a guy (30M) 4 times over the course of about 5 weeks. I‚Äôm now away for the holidays.

He‚Äôs not on social media and since we first matched on bumble, his messaging is infrequent. I‚Äôm guessing he just isn‚Äôt on his phone all that much? Or he isn‚Äôt as interested in me as he seems when we are talking.

The two guys I went on dates with before him texted me all day long, and it was honestly too much for me. I think because I‚Äôm very interested in 4 date guy, I view his infrequent texting as a negative. When we do text, he‚Äôs extremely engaging, sweet, flirty, thoughtful. He is also this way in person.

I'm looking for something serious, although I worry that perhaps my profile might be coming off as ""too serious?""

Been on Hinge for 2+ years and I send a few likes per week (always with comments). Looking to attract a professional in their 20s-30s, wanting to date seriously, settle down, and start a family.

In the past, I was able to reliably get dates in California, New York, etc., but after recently moving the the PNW/Portland earlier this year, it's been pretty rough.

Averaging about 1 like/match a week, however the last dozen matches have pretty much gone radio silent or ghosted after 1-2 replies ‚Äì with the assumption that I'm trying to write meaningful and respectful messages/questions that carry the conversation forward.

Would appreciate any feedback on order of photos, editing, deleting, new prompts, etc.

Thanks!

datingoverthirty,zuarym,1671891682.0,"If you live in an area that doesn‚Äôt have good public transportation, would you date someone who doesn‚Äôt drive?","First of all, I live in the US, which doesn‚Äôt have good public transportation unless you live in select major cities (NYC, Chicago, Boston, etc). Other than that, it is pretty hard to get around most places here without a car. 

In the area I live (Midwest), if you don't have a license here you are either handicapped mentally/physically, have a suspended license, or lazy.

I once dated someone who didn‚Äôt drive and after that I swore I would never do it again.

I always had to be the one who drove to go see them (they lived 30 minutes away), and the one to drive when we went on road trips. It got really old after a while, and one of the reasons I ended things with them. It was just a huge inconvenience and it made me feel like I was  the only one making the effort.

I'm a firm believer that a relationship should be 50/50, and if one person in the relationship doesn't drive, a good portion of the responsibility is by default put on the person who does drive. 

I‚Äôm amazed at how many guys on the apps don‚Äôt drive. I was talking to a guy and was planning to meet up until he told me he couldn't drive. I told him that the no driving thing doesn't work for me, and he told me that was shallow.

This just isn't something I'm interested in dealing with again. To avoid inevitable resentment, this is a dealbreaker for me now.

If you know X thing will cause resentment, that's more important than someone else figuring it's a petty thing.

datingoverthirty,zuglad,1671909327.0,Thinking through some uncertainty related to dating and remaining positive,"Recently I've been finding myself struggling with dealing with the uncertainty that comes from getting to know someone. It's been made worse due to the holidays being here when everyone is busy. In particular, I(31m) asked out someone(27f) on a date who I've been interested in. This person seems to be interested in me as well. I thought that I might as well ask and get it over with so I could move on if I misread them. However, her response was ""This sounds great and so fun! I would so love to however I'll be going away this weekend on an X trip!"" It's a positive response, but I was left wondering if she really meant it and it left me feeling uncertain. When we talked about the holidays some days later, she told me she was going to be away and busy with family which is entirely normal. Afterward, I gave her a holiday gift of some small ornaments which she really liked and told me so multiple times. When I was leaving her, she even stopped me to remind me again how much she liked it, before hugging it. I think at this point my interest has been communicated.

Where I'm feeling stuck with trying to cope is trying to manage the uncertainty because now I have to wait until after the holidays. When I was younger in my 20s, I would have most definitely read it in a negative way and would have abandoned ship. This led to a lot of self-sabotage since I was letting myself get in the way of forming relationships with people. For whatever reason, I believed the idea that people should automatically prioritize us as much as we prioritize them. This probably came from reading too many dating advice sites. So for example, I automatically assumed busyness meant ""no"". I also confused initial spark/chemistry with gauging how well a relationship could work when often those things were just me falling into comfortable familial patterns so I was really considering other great dates. None of these were healthy. Everyone is different, everyone has things come up, everyone has different communication styles, and it's also completely normal to not prioritize people we barely know. Good relationships take time to grow. Once I realized these things, the quality of my dating life, relationships, and my self-worth improved a lot.

Now that uncertainty is coming back which is bringing some anxiety. My takeaway going into the holidays is that I should take this as a positive since her responses to me were positive. However, I'm afraid I'm going to self-sabotage myself because of the uncertainty of not knowing for sure which is where my mind is at. Even though I planned to send a happy holiday text during the holidays, I've even thought about just ignoring my text messages so I could not be preoccupied with this person. Or maybe I should and I'm overthinking it? Now I'm here wondering what everyone's experiences are with situations similar to this. I think just hearing how other people have dealt through uncertainty or overthinking could be helpful. Any advice is appreciated.","Send her the happy holidays text, that‚Äôs totally acceptable and I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôd find it nice as well! Just try not to text her random stuff fuelled by anxiety - text with intention, like sending her holiday wishes IMO. You‚Äôve already got things right with what you wrote that you‚Äôve learned in the past, you just need to reign in the anxiety.

What works for me is I choose to believe people mean their words and actions until proven otherwise. She‚Äôs acting interested? Then believe that she‚Äôs interested. The anxiety stemming from ‚Äúbut what if she‚Äôs not interested?!‚Äù is just your emotional brain scared of potential pain and is trying to protect you, but it ends up being counterintuitive in this situation."
datingoverthirty,zuehvo,1671903164.0,What to consider a couple of months in?,"Merry Christmas to everyone celebrating

I (35F) have been dating a guy (34M) since the end of Oct. It‚Äôs been going really well. 

In the past, I‚Äôve mostly dated emotionally unavailable men whose needs I placed above my own. I would jump into those relationships very, very fast, without evaluating if they would actually work for me. Since my last relationship ended - and after years of therapy - I‚Äôm approaching dating/relationships very differently. Looking for something much healthier. I also want kids and generally understand myself a lot better, so I‚Äôm dating with intention (the intention being to find a life partner) and don‚Äôt need to date for ages to figure out what I want. 

But I‚Äôve never done this before and there‚Äôs a part of me that no longer trusts myself to make the right decision, especially when I‚Äôm infatuated with someone. 

So far, the things that are important to me are there. Primarily (aside for being compatible in many ways), what I‚Äôm most excited by is our incredible level of communication. We both bring up anything and everything that we want, are worried about, etc. He‚Äôs also been in therapy for a while and has a good sense of self that he can articulate well. We both strongly believe that people should be willing and eager to grow over time, and that it‚Äôs a life long process. I think this willingness is necessary for a successful relationship, which requires hard work, lots of talk, compromise, and the ability to weather the storms that come up. It feels like we have what it takes to build a strong partnership.

But still, there are things that can be dealbreakers or incompatibilities that will only be revealed with time. For example, where each person wants to live (what city, what type of environment). And I‚Äôm having trouble figuring out what those things are. I have anxiety that I‚Äôm going to devote all this time to this person only to find out it‚Äôs not going to work and be even older and even more heartbroken than when I started. I understand that this is always a possibility - all relationships have the chance of ending one way or another. And I‚Äôm not just trying to shoehorn this man into my life because I‚Äôm desperate for kids. I want to make sure he‚Äôs the right person to do that with first.

But I don‚Äôt really know what to look for now that it‚Äôs around the 2-3 months mark. What‚Äôs normal at this stage? We haven‚Äôt met each others friends or families yet and it wasn‚Äôt something I was thinking about much but now I‚Äôm starting to overthink it. We‚Äôre going to a party with my friends soon and most of our friends/fam live in the same city as us so it‚Äôs not a logistical issue. 

I know 2 months isn‚Äôt that long but my past experience has me gaslighting myself. I recognize that I keep approaching certain relationship questions from a place of fear and I‚Äôm trying not to. But I‚Äôm scared! 

What should we be asking each other and talking about? What should we be doing? What should I be looking out for?

I have therapy next week and I‚Äôll talk about this then but in the meantime thought I‚Äôd ask a bunch of internet strangers.

Thanks!

Edit: thank you all for taking the time to share your advice! I really appreciate it. What makes the most sense from everyone‚Äôs comments is to be watching out for consistency, day-to-day compatibility, how he shows up now that it isn‚Äôt the first few dates and we‚Äôre settling into more of a routine, and whether his actions match his words. So far so good! ü§û","I (33F) feel the same way. I was in a long term relationship for 3.5 years and in hindsight I also realized I ignored a lot of things for the sake of being with someone/wanting a relationship/a certain life instead of approaching it the way you are now: with security, confidence and intention. I also through therapy and just time, have decided I cannot emotionally go through that again and this has created a little bit of pressure to ‚Äúnot fail‚Äù again and ‚Äúwaste time‚Äù, but as you said, there‚Äôs always a risk with any relationship that it could fail. This could be for countless reasons. This could happen within a few months or after 30 years. This gives me a lot of anxiety, which is what it sounds like you are also experiencing.
I tell you all this to say you‚Äôre not alone: most people feel this way who are seeking a meaningful relationship. Even your partner may be having very similar thoughts. I think 30s are a reasonable time in our lives to bring up things about the future like kids, where you ultimately see yourself, financial plans, etc. earlier than those in their 20s. If someone in their mid 30s is put off, defensive or deflective when you bring up these things, they aren‚Äôt in the same mindset and are not at the level you are. If they are looking for the same things, they‚Äôll discuss these things openly and won‚Äôt find it weird if you bring them up. I think after 3 months is fine to ask these questions; waiting until a year to talk about these things is wasting more time than if you were to bring it up early and work through these questions and core elements of a potential serious relationship early on. There are no ‚Äúshoulds‚Äù but my advice is don‚Äôt hold back if you want to talk about these things now and don‚Äôt let the fear of it being too early stop you from starting those conversations."

datingoverthirty,zto90t,1671818006.0,Am I weird for holding a deep grudge against someone I dated for a few months?,"Hi all!

I‚Äôm trying to work out if it‚Äôs normal to hold a grudge against someone I dated (more like situationship) briefly for a few months last year. It was intense, at least for me. 

I‚Äôve since spoken to him a couple times in the last year and half, as he‚Äôs in my circle - though thankfully not close.  But I feel a deep resentment and grudge towards him, which I really can‚Äôt seem to let go of. I‚Äôve made it clear to him too, I can‚Äôt really fake niceness :/ which is why I‚Äôve stayed away from him to avoid any issues. 

I was very hurt at the time, (granted I made my boo boo at the end by saying some angry things), and he never has apologised. If anything, he acts better than me and arrogant, which winds me up. 

I know it shouldn‚Äôt affect me, and I don‚Äôt even like him as a person now, but somehow it still really affects me. Id understand if it was a long term ex, but logically and in reality, I barely knew the guy. I only ask because there was a group chat message to all meet after new year (which he‚Äôs in). But I can‚Äôt fathom being able to sit anywhere on a table with him, that‚Äôs how deep the grudge goes. It‚Äôs been a year and a half - surely I should have let go of all that by now? I feel childish for holding onto it.

datingoverthirty,zt9xof,1671782864.0,Should I end this?,"Im 39f cute successful have a couple degrees. Lived all over the world. Met a guy while I was home visiting, had a whirlwind of a romance. I quit my job and moved home. 

He has two kids from his previous marriage whom I adore. 

Since we were long distance for a while, when I moved back I stayed in an air bnb to acclimate. Then that got expensive so I moved in with my parents. It‚Äôs been rough, not having a home and all. I‚Äôm on edge. I‚Äôm commuting back and forth to his place overnight for quite some time and was planning to move in in January. I was so excited to finally have a place to call home. 

He has been upset with me lately for being negative. I understand that he is positive and doesn‚Äôt want to be brought down. I do have some challenges with anxiety and depression and I‚Äôll admit that I complain a lot sometimes and I‚Äôve committed to stopping. 

We have a therapist and just had a session this week. 

We have been dating just over a year and plan on hosting Christmas Eve at his place and my family is coming. We are also planning to take his kids to Disney in March. We signed a lease in Arizona for a vacation property that we will spend 50% of our time at when we don‚Äôt have the kids kind of going back and forth. 

In the past when we fought it got very toxic. Emotionally abusive. Name calling threats insults silent treatment for days. It got really bad. Most of it did come from
him which he now admits. 

I ended things in September when I got tired of him being an absolute asshole to me when he was mad. He went to therapy, and he did seem to improve. It was ROUGH two months of fighting when we fought. But the we seemed to solve it. 

Now he‚Äôs complaining about my negativity, which i accept. It seems that he doesn‚Äôt want to hear any complaints from me in the moment that I‚Äôm frustrated. Okay, fine. 

Anyway, without knowing the severity of this, I complained about my mom today. He said he didn‚Äôt have capacity for it, so I asked when we could set a date to talk about it (there‚Äôs an actual problem that needs a solution). He gave me a date. I dropped it and started talking about other stuff. 

Anyway he wouldn‚Äôt drop it. Kept going and going about how this isn‚Äôt resolved. What isn‚Äôt resolved? I complained, you said no, we picked a date. Why couldn‚Äôt we move on?

Well from there his old near abusive (but not as bad) side kicked in. Later that evening he went off on me about how he doesn‚Äôt want my mom coming to Christmas Eve, that I shouldn‚Äôt come over tomorrow (when we were going to be preparing for dinner),and now that he doesn‚Äôt want me to move in in January because I‚Äôm ‚ÄúToo chaotic‚Äù and he doesn‚Äôt want me and my family‚Äôs chaos infecting his kids. I can understand that. But it was such a minor complaint (I‚Äôll post it in the comments) that I was surprised. Truth be told, things ARE chaotic. I‚Äôm living with my mom, I have no space or privacy, I quit my lucrative job and am getting another degree and starting a business. It‚Äôs chaotic. But we have discussed this and like two days ago he was counting down the days until I‚Äôd move in and the chaos would be over. I decorated his whole house for Christmas, baked cookies with the kids, it‚Äôs been lovely. 

Now he‚Äôs afraid I can‚Äôt handle the chaos of his life. He‚Äôs an entrepreneur and we would be commuting back and forth between Arizona and Jersey a couple times a month. I tell him this is different because we have two HOMES. It‚Äôs not a constant clusterfuck. 

Anyway, now he wants me to rent another air bnb for 2-3 months while he assesses if I can handle going back and forth to Arizona. It‚Äôs $1800/month for an air bnb, which is so much for me since I‚Äôm not working. He doesn‚Äôt seem to understand that bc he makes millions of dollars as an entrepreneur. I tell him and he doesn‚Äôt care. 

I don‚Äôt know. He‚Äôs worried that my personality is just chaotic and the truth is that it kind of is. I go to therapy, I AM a therapist, I am committed but sometimes I don‚Äôt handle my emotions well. I own that. 

So he just dropped all of this on a few hours ago (in a mean, condescending way). I found an air bnb that would work. 

But there‚Äôs a little voice inside me saying‚Ä¶this is your chance. Leave. Get out. I have enough savings to last me a little over a year and I should start making money within a few months. I could go to Arizona and rent my own air bnb for the same amount of money and not have to deal with his crazy schedule. 

But I am 39 man. I don‚Äôt want to date again. He‚Äôs a good guy mostly, aside from these occasional totally mean outbursts. He has a beautiful house, he is smart, he plans dates, he takes care of himself, he wants a dog (but also hates my cat, which is a whole other issue). I know he loves me. 

And I understand that my negativity isn‚Äôt cool and will fix it. It‚Äôs also an opportunity for me to fix it, too. 

His communication has improved so much since therapy and tonight was just a shock. I also think he was drinking.  But now I‚Äôm up at 3am wondering if I‚Äôm supposed to tell my mom we aren‚Äôt going for Christmas Eve? Is it right for me to live in an air bnb to ‚Äúprove myself‚Äù to this guy?

I AM negative sometimes. Probably too much. He doesn‚Äôt want me to bring him down and I get that, and I should fix that for me. 

But that voice‚Ä¶.when I think of leaving‚Ä¶.I feel a little relieved. If my business were going I wouldn‚Äôt be so afraid. I‚Äôd probably leave tbh. I froze my eggs, i can still have a baby if I wanted. 

I‚Äôm trying to decide if I should stick around for someone like this, or just leave. 

Sometimes I just want to leave.

EDIT: if I leave, where should I move to? I have Canadian and US citizenship, and have extensively traveled. I do have a cat who would have to come with me. I‚Äôm into the spiritual stuff, maybe Austin?  Or maybe I could road trip Miami > Austin > Denver > Portland > Vancouver? With my cat, and work remote? Spend a few months in each location?","So many words in your post...He's just not that into you. You accept him name calling, threatening and insulting you.

Then suddenly he puts his dick out and forced my hand on it trying to get a hand job from me. And now he asks me to kiss his neck and keep massaging his dick .

I love you‚Äô run around in my head when we see each other the last few times. before it was ‚Äòi think I‚Äôm falling for this person‚Äô. and now it‚Äôs becoming like an internal siren. 

We‚Äôve been seeing each other so much lately. I think about 5 times this week? In my last relationship we saw each other generally once a week, and even on trips we had away together it didn‚Äôt feel like we spent this much actual quality time. Now even though it‚Äôs been a short period (8-9 weeks) it‚Äôs been so good. I mentioned to him yesterday that I just feel it‚Äôs so effortless to be around him and he agreed, said it‚Äôs a good way of describing it. 

We went climbing and came back to mine afterwards, we started making out petty heavily, only kept getting distracted because we were also taking about other things. When I realised that we were sat on the couch for the last two hours in this funny state of being half undressed, touching, laughing, our bodies intertwined with my legs on him and his arms on me, i felt almost consumed by the desire to tell him I love him. I instead said that I love how even though the sex has been so‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ epic, and we mostly end up naked and at mine, we seem to also get so much joy out of just chatting that it doesn‚Äôt at all feel like it‚Äôs all about the sex. He laughed and said it‚Äôs definitely not all about it. Theres just such an ease to this. It‚Äôs easy telling him hard things. It‚Äôs easy being myself with him. He said he feels I relax and centre him. 

We‚Äôve also been getting a lot more‚Ä¶ ugh‚Ä¶ gushy when we have sex. It‚Äôs all praise and declarations of various ways to say ‚Äòwow‚Äô from both of us. I keep thinking I‚Äôll slip an ‚Äòi love you‚Äô in there. I never understood how in movies/shows/whatever people keep saying they‚Äôve said it first during sex, since it was always so different for me. I rationalise my feelings, dissect and explain them, I let them form gradually - and although this formed gradually, it also feels overwhelming at times. As if the desire to express this new found love is imminent. There‚Äôs so much of it, it‚Äôs too big to contain. This feeling feels like it isn‚Äôt mine, like it‚Äôs bigger than me. 

We went to sleep and I found myself in my new favourite position, middle spoon between him and my dog. When we woke up he snoozed his alarm. I don‚Äôt have work today, he does. We cuddled for a while and made out a bit, then when we both got up, he made my bed. I didn‚Äôt ask, he just did it. He said that it‚Äôs always made when we go upstairs, so he knows I like it made up, and it only takes a second ‚Äòit‚Äôs one less thing for you to do today‚Äô. I love this man. It‚Äôs weird how it‚Äôs never the obviously sexy things he does, however hot they are, that get me to absolutely melt from the inside out. It‚Äôs the little things. It‚Äôs the ways in which his kind and caring personality shines through his actions that I just find so disarming. I have no walls with him. It feels incredibly vulnerable and scary. It also feels worth it."
datingoverthirty,zt0n1v,1671752379.0,Dating someone who doesn‚Äôt share some core interest(s). How do you feel/deal with it?,"If there are couples in the audience, please feel free to answer, since your experience will be even more enlightening in this case.

Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre getting to know someone, dating them but not official. They have many qualities you like: kindness, outgoing, attractive, etc. Any qualities you admire.

However, there are core things about you that they show no interest in. For example: dance, or poetry or sports or reading. Something that feels very core to who you are. You can‚Äôt connect to them at all on that level. Maybe you text them saying ‚ÄúOh wow I just read this amazing novel, the writer really explained the depth of‚Ä¶‚Äù and their replies to messages like that are ‚ÄúOh, that‚Äôs cool! Sounds like a good book!‚Äù. No engagement about what you actually said, no curiosity or interest on that topic.

But you have fun when you go out, you have similar values, you want similar things in life.

Is this a matter of ‚Äúnobody can ever be everything for you?‚Äù Or is it incompatibility? How do/did you decide whether something was too important to be missing from a relationship? And/or how do you cope with your partner not being interested in a core part(s) of who you are?","For me, it all comes down to what exactly matters to you. 

Here's my scenario. My bf (34M) and I (33F) are actually complete opposites. He is an introverted homebody who likes the outdoors and enjoys solitary activities like carving. I am an extrovert with a small circle of friends who likes talking and who works as a social worker for a living. My BF is a graphic designer who works from home full time. We have had arguments about things like travelling (I like to travel, he hates it), money (he penny pinches, I splurge), vices (he likes to drink, I do not) and gifts (he hates surprises and presents and I love them).

Now, for some people, some of these things are non-negotiables, and that's fair. 

However, my non-negotiables involve my values and my personal faith/religion, which he meets with me 100%

Our political leanings are the same, our views on religion are the same, our views on marriage, family and commitment are the same. We agree on key fundamental things like loyalty, honesty, faithfulness, and trust. We both love animals and both want kids. Most importantly, we are constantly working on how best to communicate and respect each other's differences and what to do when we butt heads / don't agree. 

To contrast, my last long term ex seemed to be a dream come true. We had many similar interests: travel, extroverts, movies, music etc. Our families were of the same culture too but there were other things that were off: he hid things from me, he was dealing with a lot of family drama, and worst of all when we talked about settling down, he wasn't ready to start a life but instead of breaking up with me or talking with me about that, he left the country and then cheated on me. 

So, ask yourself what you are willing to compromise and what you absolutely cannot. Not everyone can find that perfect person that will match you 100% but maybe that's not what you need. Maybe you need someone who you can learn from and grow with and it is through your differences that you can do so. 

So yeah, choose wisely and good luck!"

datingoverthirty,zsrtsf,1671730492.0,What was the point of it all?,"Hey so I‚Äôm 37M. Around mid November I got a message from a friend saying one of her friends was asking if she knew anyone single, so my name got mentioned. She (32) then found me on Facebook, thought I was cute etc etc and wanted to get to know me. The catch was she‚Äôs long distance (about 90min drive) and has 2 young kids. But I thought hey why not. It could be interesting to see how this goes. Very rare for me to get set up. So we swapped numbers. 

The next two weeks were like a whirlwind. Constant messaging, talking on phone / FaceTime for hours, we just seemed to have this crazy connection with so much in common. It felt like we were both really in to each other. It‚Äôs been so long since I‚Äôd experienced any kind of connection like this. We then started making plans to meet up but at the same time it just began to simmer down. Messages were losing that spark of excitement and phone call lengths got less and less. I understood completely that she has a busy life as a working single mom so I put it down to that and me just overthinking it. 

Last week I sent her a long message just laying everything out, how I felt about her, would love to get to know her more but that I couldn‚Äôt help notice the excitement had dissipated. She replied by largely reciprocating what I‚Äôd said and explained how her life is so crazy right now and so just doesn‚Äôt have time to dedicate to anything serious. I understood and respected her honesty completely. One thing just didn‚Äôt make sense though. She reached out to me at the start. Her intentions were pretty clear so I was happy to be on board. But now I just feel really hard done by. I‚Äôve had similar conversations on OLD where it all sounds exciting and then they say sorry my head‚Äôs not in the right place need to go sort myself out ok bye üëãüèª. 

So now we‚Äôre hardly messaging at all. I‚Äôm just baffled by this whole thing. What was the point of it all? I get that these things happen but didn‚Äôt expect it in these circumstances. Just feels like maybe she needed some validation. I hate thinking that might be the case as she came across as such a lovely person. I‚Äôm so bummed about this.

Edit: before it started to dissipate we did actually make plans to meet. But she cancelled a couple days before. We talked about getting together just before Christmas but just today she cancelled again.

Edit 2: I had a catch up with my friend the other day and she filled me in on what she knew. It sounds as though this girl got distracted by another guy who she went to school with, dated briefly but they broke up after he was mean to her. But now he‚Äôs back and wants to reconnect.","I don‚Äôt see this as her needing validation. I see this as her wanting something (a deep connection with someone) in concept ‚Äî but being unable to be vulnerable enough to accomplish that in reality. 

And, as much as it sucks, that‚Äôs pretty common: everyone wants to meet the love of their life until they realize how much they need to let someone in to actually have that. They open up initially because it feels good (kind of like how it‚Äôs easy to vent to a stranger at a bar) then get spooked when things get serious and pull away.

ETA: I wouldn‚Äôt overthink your own behavior on this one. It sounds like you were communicative, emotionally open, and respectful. Sometimes you just have to let people work through their own issues."
datingoverthirty,zscsja,1671685209.0,So Happy It's Thursday!, Got some good news you want to share?,"I haven't posted an update in a long time but... my partner and I got engaged last weekend after 3 years together (we met on Hinge just before the pandemic).  

We took a short trip and did a short (but very steep) hike into the fog and I did it at the top.  The trail was completely deserted.  She was surprised (and almost slipped) even though she knew it was coming before the end of the year and forgot to say yes for a while, but we got there in the end.   Afterwards, we had a nice dinner and then sang a bunch of karaoke in this small town where we became quite popular, haha (obviously because of my voice).

I had somewhere around 100 first dates in ~1.5 years before that and it just made me even more certain that this is the person for me."
datingoverthirty,zs9oma,1671676595.0,What to make of people who change their minds in extremely early stages,"I participated in a matchmaking service four months ago. The matchmakers exchange your profiles with each other, and put you in contact if there's mutual interest. I said yes to talk to a guy, and I was told that he said no.

Out of the blue about three months later, he emailed me asking for us to have the opportunity to get to know each other. He said something about how he didn't want to miss out on someone great because of the manner in which he meets that person, and he said he also wanted to ""explain something"". He didn't directly address that he wasn't interested in talking to me when we were paired by the matchmakers three months ago. (The service was $1200 btw. Kind of a lot, so I took it seriously and tried to be super open to the options I was given.)

To me it seems like he's just lonely because it's Christmas and he wants to call in backup. But maybe that's my low self worth or avoidance talking. I need a sanity check - is it worth entertaining this at all?

EDITED TO ADD: the reason I'm asking is because I feel this is pretty different from swiping. You could swipe left on someone one hour, then right on them the next. Depending on how busy you are the convo may fizzle or one of you gets annoyed about something and unmatches. I don't think it says anything about interest levels. But this was a service where you're paying a lot for not a huge number of options so that to me means people really have to think about who they want to talk to, and try and be as open as possible. So it does feel more like an actual rejection. Thank you for all the advice and it's interesting to see how split people are. ","So my first thought is that maybe he met someone else at the time and declined to meet with you because he wanted to focus on that.  It's not that you didn't necessarily meet his standards and more that the timing was off.

However, his message sounds weird as hell:

>He said something about how he didn't want to miss out on someone greatbecause of the manner in which he meets that person, and he said he alsowanted to ""explain something"".

What does he mean about the manner in which he meets that person?  Is he saying that the fact that you were connected through the matchmaking service - the matchmaking service he presumably paid to join - would otherwise be a strike against you?

Or does this mean the matchmaker will look for likely candidates outside their own client base?  Because I can understand why someone might be wary about meeting someone if they were approached by a third party.

In any case, what is the thing he needs to explain, and why mention it if he's going to be vague?  It's like ""we need to talk"" before you're even in a relationship with someone.  Just weird.

>I need a sanity check - is it worth entertaining this at all?

[On a purely selfish level](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQRW0RM4V0k), I hope you go on the date and then report back on what the story was."

datingoverthirty,zr3wwn,1671580582.0,Should I feel offended or i am wrong here?,"My two female friends urged me to message the woman (i know I know..) who ghosted me couple weeks ago so I messaged her today to close the loop and get my friends off my back since not much to lose. 

I messaged her about it saying it's fine if she doesn't want to see me anymore and I can close the loop and wish her best.

She actually responded with  ""i have an important interview end of January and i need to devote all my time for this opportunity.  if you want to find someone to sleep with then I don't want to waste your time""

I know she's busy with that interview(she sent me her prep schedule before ) and those openings are global openings meaning anyone who is qualified in the world can apply and those positions are mostly open due to retirement or promotions.

 I did say that no matter how busy she is she can't even go out? I did offer to do something NYE.

I don't know if it is offensive but I kind of feel offended hearing her say if I want to find someone to sleep with comment especially we have been going out for half year and never been intimate. I mean it is true in recent dates I tried to initiate the conversation of getting a room or go to my place but I still kinda feel weird inside seeing that comment. Maybe I am at fault here.

I mean if it is once in a blue moon job opportunity for her maybe I need to give her the space until February? Hit pause on this and just keep looking and revisit February?

Update:
So she replied saying she feels i am anti chinese from some of the topics we talked about before on Covid etc. She mentioned to me early on before and I have since stopped talking about China related topics entirely. 

She says she still has trauma from previous things I said like how chinese covid restrictions not long term solution (proven right since they gave up) etc. And she says she feels my views might be bad for our kids in the future. Now she says whenever we go out she has to block that trauma (I guess been 3ish month now?) and even when we try to be more physical she has to hold that in. She says she doesn't have the energy to do that with her interview stuff going on. If I am still interested after her thing is done in end of Jan we can talk it out. It feels way to elaborate as a ghost thing? 

She sounds sincere and like I said I stopped talking about China related topics entirely just like in US there are some ""trigger topics"" people might not talk about. Initially the only reason I brought some of those up was to get a different perspective from her since she has been in China for 20 years but also she went international for 12+ years so maybe her view point would be different.","Why are you so hung up on her? You‚Äôve made several posts about how she hasn‚Äôt shown you much interest, multiple people have commented remarking on the clear lack of interest on her end, and now she responds like this after not talking to you for two weeks *after you asked her to be your girlfriend*.

datingoverthirty,zqv6w4,1671559629.0,pulling away?,"I (32f) have been seeing a guy (31m) since late summer. Things had been going well, he was communicative and texted me throughout the day, everyday, for the past 4 months. Earlier this month we had a little spat (i felt like i wasnt being prioritized) which resulted in him giving me the silent treatment for 2 days or so. We finally connected, but didn't get to talk through the issue because he got irritated when I tried to bring it up. It seemed to resolve itself on his own and semi normalcy resumed, but this weekend I seemed to annoy him again and he pulled away. We had a few short phone calls over the weekend, but I haven't heard anything from him since, despite calling and texting one time each.

I'm very in my head right now and freaking out and overanalyzing everything. Any perspective or insight would be appreciated.

Update 1: I'm calling some therapist today to try to make an appointment and do some self healing and reflection within. I will try to reach out to him today and see if I get any answers or a response.

Update 2: I called him tonight and ge picked up, the conversation seemed off and vague so I point blank asked him where things stand, he said he wasn't sure where his feelings stood and he was trying to figure it out, so it looks like we are done.","As a former puller away when things got tough it‚Äôs a trait I have come to hate from others.

datingoverthirty,zquwe2,1671558942.0,"He cheated on his ex, is it foolish to think he could be loyal?","I used to hear about marriages ending because one spouse cheated, and I would think to myself that it must have been because they were miserable. And I would secretly think to myself that it would never happen in my marriage. 

Then it happened to me. The pain and devastation were nearly unbearable, and I will truly never be the same. And I realized that there is no justifiable reason for cheating. None.

So my concern... I met a guy on OLD around 2 months ago, and we have had coffee a couple of times when our schedules lined up. I like him. He seems to like me. Daily contact, easy chit chat, he's my kind of tall, pale and dorky. But last night, the conversation led to me asking if he'd ever cheated before. He was honest and said he had, but he told his (then) wife, and it wasn't the reason the marriage ended.

His admission made my blood run cold. It was late, so I didn't continue on that topic, but I was discouraged that he didn't say it was something he deeply regrets or wish he could take back. Just that it wasn't what ended the marriage. Even if that's true, that doesn't make it ok! 

Can I trust someone who has cheated before? Is it right to basically hold that against him? Is that a reasonable deal breaker? Or do I need more information before deciding? I don't want my past trauma to ruin future relationships, but I also don't want to ignore signs that this isn't the guy for me.","Only you can be the judge of that, but as someone whose wife cheated during the marriage (and it was the main driver for our divorce), I can tell you that it would be an immediate dealbreaker for me.  I appreciate the candor and honesty - it doesn't mean the person is ultimately destined to cheat again, it doesn't mean they're a bad person or anything like that, but it does mean that it'd be extremely difficult for me to fully trust the person.  It's up to you whether you think you could.  I don't think there's any harm in asking for more context, but personally I'm not sure what context the person could give me to make me okay with justifying it, and I'm not sure I'd believe what they're telling me anyway.

I wouldn't wish the pain of being the betrayed spouse on anyone."

I'd be happy continuing at this pace, but I'm also cautious enough to wonder if it would be prudent to set up rules to stop our lives from becoming too intertwined until we've been together long enough to know if this is real.","Nothing here says ‚Äúmoving too quickly‚Äù to me. sleepovers with someone you‚Äôve slept with aren‚Äôt abnormal even after a couple weeks if you‚Äôre dating and discussing hypotheticals next summer etc isn‚Äôt moving too fast either.

We were making out and soon he got up and motioned toward the bedroom to which i quickly told him that I was not going to have sex with him that night. Perhaps it was how quickly I said it or maybe I came off as being uncomfortable, but is it expected to sleep with someone who invites you inside after dinner?

We are both generous people (he pays for 75-80% because he‚Äôs the gentlemen type, but I insist on contributing like the adult that I am and I‚Äôm sure it will be more equal in the future).

So, gifts? If so, price range?","This is a conversation to have with him, no one on this sub will be able to give you a good idea. I don‚Äôt think it inappropriate to give a gift, especially if you‚Äôre spending Christmas together generally though.

Why don‚Äôt you just let him know you‚Äôd want to exchange gifts but set a $20-50 limit on it (whatever you think is reasonable for the timeframe and your budgets/finances)."
datingoverthirty,zpechp,1671413770.0,Sex while dating?,"Hi all - 

I've (32m) been seeing a woman (33f) for about 3 weeks. We've been on 3 dates, the 3rd was cooking at my place and watching a movie. Today we had an impromptu 4th hang out at her place because both of our schedules freed up. 

I like her a lot! We line up really well on a lot of things. Could definitely see myself dating her long term.

She has said she wants to move slowly, which I obviously respect. But the sexual chemistry has definitely been there the last two times. I'm not a stranger to sex at all, and in a lot of other scenarios likely would have had sex by now. It's a really important factor for me for connecting with partners. Today we made out and there was some over the pants action, but nothing else.

She texted me after and said today was great and she liked being touched and touching me, but could we slow it down? What she wants isn't congruous with how she wants to get to know me. It felt like a very natural progression to me and she was very into it as well. 

She suggested not being at either of our places ""going forward for a bit"". 

I guess I'm wondering how you all view sex while dating? Have you been in a similar scenario?

Edit: Lots of great replies, thanks a lot to everyone for sharing your viewpoints.","I used to be a sex by the third or fourth date type person but so many guys take advantage of that and get you to have sex quickly then bounce, or put you in the casual sex box while they look for someone ‚Äúgirlfriend material‚Äù.

One is the cutest and smartest but has Asperger‚Äôs and even if we are perfectly fine and I‚Äôd dare to say we are a little bit in love with each other I wouldn‚Äôt say we cover completely each other‚Äôs needs. But the match is so close but for some reason it scares me. They live abroad and I‚Äôd need to move to their country cos of their medical job. This has been going on for two years. 

Another one is the cutest too but we have rather shallow conversations and they don‚Äôt have studies. We met 5 months ago only and we are still getting to know each other. But I had never met anyone with such sex appeal and with so many signs of healthy green flags. Each of their messages makes one feel so good. They live abroad too but we see each other in a monthly basis as well as on daily calls and they seem quite okay with changing places (they are learning my native language and I speak their native language too). 

The last one is a friend from my group of friends who is amazing xd very high IQ as well as EI and loves doing massages and having deep conversations like me. I can‚Äôt picture myself in bed with him but I‚Äôve wanted to kiss him before. He mentioned he dreamt he kissed me. Everyone in the group knows we kinda like each other.

datingoverthirty,zoa3qg,1671294860.0,Sparks vs Compatibility?,"So something that's come up in my life, and that I've noticed many people talk about are Sparks and great Chemistry. Compatibility. I've definitely been dumped for a lack of sparks before and was a bit set back by it. 

I know some of the definitions are a little all over the place. 

However, I just feel like I'm in a minority where I place very little focus on sparks? 

For me, every person I date is being held against a virtual checklist (which is flexible). 

I look for qualities like, 

-Good relationship with their family
-How do they talk about past partners, are they a positive person? 
-What are their ambitions? Does this person have goals? Depth? Intellectual? 
-How do they handle challenges and respond to problems? 
-Am I physically attracted to this person? (Very important)
-Are they silly? Can they relax and are they fun to be around? 
-Do they have boundaries? 
-Do we have similar interests, if we don't, are they genuinely interested in my interests/my pursuit of my interests? 
-Do I genuinely enjoy speaking to this person? 

I guess my one takeaway is, some of it's kind of a bummer, because I realize there are ways you can ""artificially"" escalate that feeling of ""sparks"", through methods such as first date kisses, and light touch, which I feel like I should place more importance on doing in my own personal dating life. I state ""artificially"" because sparks can come and go, there isn't necessarily a permanent status to them. Sparks can be created or taken away based on interactions and how you show up as a man, in my honest opinion (if she isn't baseline attracted to you though, it will never happen). 

What do you guys think on the importance of sparks versus other dating criteria/requirements in your partner?","My theory on this: people tend to have an attraction wavelength and a flirt wavelength. You can find a person attractive, have tons in common, have all kinds of fun together, while still not feeling, at a gut level, that the other person is *attracted to you* ‚Äî and vice versa. You can be on the same attraction wavelength but different flirt wavelengths, so it feels like there‚Äôs a spark missing.

This is exactly what happened with the girl I‚Äôm currently dating. We almost broke things off early because of a lack of spark, until one night a random comment from her made me smile in a way that made her feel, for the first time, that I was attracted to her.  I could tell by her reaction that she liked me displaying attraction to her, and things grew exponentially from there.  *That* was the spark, and feeling attracted to each other and having tons in common wasn‚Äôt enough to produce it.

Some people are good at provoking or experiencing moments like that, other people aren‚Äôt, and sometimes it depends on matching flirt wavelengths with the person you‚Äôre seeing."

Ideally I‚Äôd like to get more matches, but also I‚Äôve been plagued by 2 specific problems:

1. I only very rarely match in my local area.  I‚Äôm in the Oakland metro area, but seem to only match with women in the San Francisco and San Jose metro areas. In the entire time I‚Äôve been on the apps (4 years), I‚Äôve only managed to go on a date with 1-2 people in my local area, vs 30+ in the others.  This is a huge drag because of commute times. 

2. I do very poorly on every app except Coffee Meets Bagel, and the demographics who swipe on me are extremely skewed: about 90% asian, and mostly Chinese immigrants. Ideally I would like more equal representation, or a spread that is more representative of the actual local demographics of single women. Note, I‚Äôm not saying that I don‚Äôt find asian women unattractive. It‚Äôs mostly that I‚Äôm almost never able to get past the first date or even the chatting stage, due to huge cultural differences. 

I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9‚Äù (because it definitely does matter) and looking for childfree (no children now or in the future)","This isn't meant to be a huge criticism, but the mix of photos, however authentic they may be, idk I don't know you, make you seem like you're putting a great deal of effort into being pervieved as ""cool"", which isn't necessarily a bad thing, it shows effort, attention and care, but it comes off (to me anyways and I don't even listen to myself most the time) that you're a bit insecure and working really hard to put up a front of a chill, fun, laid back guy with cool guy hobbies and better fashion sense than some other guys.

datingoverthirty,zngwxb,1671203595.0,Has anyone else ever waited a long time to hear or say ‚Äú I love you‚Äù - what happened and do you think I‚Äôm being too understanding?,"So my new bf of six months recently told me that it would take him a while before he‚Äôs comfortable saying I love you. We say other things to each other and I do enjoy our connection and relationship for the most part. We say we care about each other, we‚Äôre happy to be in each other‚Äôs lives, he‚Äôs told me he‚Äôs grateful for what I bring to his life (exceptionally considerate, supportive, accepting, affectionate), don‚Äôt want to be with anyone else, we talk casually about the future as a possibility (we sometimes talk about what having kids would be like, that we would need a bigger place if we moved in together, marriage, he wants me to meet his mom in a few months when he goes back to his home state again), etc. For my friends I‚Äôve spoken to, this is what being in love feels like it looks like to them and why they say it early. He thinks people say it too early, and I kind of get that. I asked him how he views being in love, because I always seek to understand him and his mindset better. He said he has only said it once and it took him two years, that‚Äôs why he thinks it will take him a while and he just wants me to know. He said being in love for him is when you‚Äôre ready to make significant sacrifices for the other persons happiness or to have them in your life. That sounds like a higher level commitment to me, and he was trying to move to another country for this ex, so that makes sense. I asked why he thinks it takes him a while to say it and he said it may be because his parents weren‚Äôt affectionate with one another.

I guess his explanation made me feel a little better about it, to understand it better. It‚Äôs still not what I wanted to hear, although, I should say I have been asking myself how I feel about saying it as well. I haven‚Äôt said it either, even though it has crossed my mind - I just express what I‚Äôm feeling instead of saying those words.   I think of love as evolving and tiered kind of. The love my best friend has for bf at 3 months when they said it is obviously different than what they‚Äôll have at 2 years, and it‚Äôs reassuring to hear it often along the way.

I guess no one can really answer this for me, but the risk of relationships is challenging for me. That‚Äôs why I avoided them for so long lol My current conclusion is to continue enjoying the moment and our connection and see where it goes. I may get to a point where I can‚Äôt wait any longer or he may say it earlier than expected. It‚Äôs still annoying though.","Honestly I'm not sure how I feel about this either. Like I kind of appreciate people who are this thoughtful about defining love and what the word means to them, and are conscientious about not throwing it around. But you're right, it is helpful to have reassurance along the way to a fuller commitment. I dont think I'd be comfortable in a 2 yr relationship without some mention of love. That said his explanation seems valid, because in his mind love = willingness to commit and make sacrifices, at least you know when the word comes that he really really means it. 

I think I'm landing on, as long as the communication is good and you're clear on how he feels and he's giving you that reassurance that he has strong romantic feelings and sees a future, that meets your definition for love so you can translate it properly ;)"

The man came over yesterday, after we‚Äôve seen each other Wednesday too. We were supposed to go climbing but went into my house because I needed to change, only we ended up very naked and skipped the workout (I‚Äôll count it as cardio though). 

It again was that magical-sexy combo of making out, chatting, laughing, touching, cuddling, staring at each other smiling and more sex. Ugh. It was so damn good. We‚Äôve started doing the ‚Äòdescribing things we like about each other with ‚ÄòI love how you -insert thing here-‚Äô and I also definitely feel like this is growing and that this is someone I can love. 

We were talking about some rather deep things today. I feel like we‚Äôre getting to know each other better and better. So far I like all of it. I love how positive he is, I love his energy, I love spending time together. I love how much I‚Äôm laughing around him and with him. He started making super silly terrible jokes at some point and I have no idea how he managed to make dad jokes sexy, but I swear this man is magic. 

I‚Äôve suggested that we do something out of town this weekend, since otherwise all we do is hang out at mine.

datingoverthirty,zmtehk,1671131741.0,Finally met someone.. and he's moving away,"Long story short, I have been single for five years (I've had some situationships and short term ""things"" in that time but no real relationship). In 2019 I met someone through friends, we had a great connection, but he was in a relationship at the time and I forgot about him. Fast forward to November and we matched on Tinder. I was elated.

Within 24 hours of us reconnecting, he accepted a job in the US that starts in early January (I am in Canada). It's a 1.5 hour plane ride or 6 hour drive away. He sees this as a permanent (or for the next while) move while he establishes his career. He's a dual citizen, and has lived in the city we live in for 15 years (like me).

Despite knowing this, against my better judgement, I went ahead and dated him this past month. I just honestly have not had a connection like this with anyone since I met my ex, it feels truly special. However the reality of the situation is sort of destroying me and I don't know what to do. I feel so conflicted.

He's going through this major life transition and is giving me as much as he can, but I feel like I'm falling hard and he's not, or at least not as much. He talks about our great connection and how it's confusing him and making him question his plans, but he seems to actively be stopping himself from falling for me in the same way, though he's obviously also crazy for me. He's said as much. Maybe he doesn't want to fall in love right now and is holding back, or maybe he simply can't given he's undertaking this huge life change. It was all ""let's just see what happens"" at the beginning, and it's still like that, except I'm falling in love.

My fear is he is going to move to Big Fancy City, and forget about me, or I'll be relegated to this transition moment of his life, and eventually he'll move on, it will fade away. Or otherwise I'll be in a long distance relationship, which doesn't seem to gibe with this ""fresh start"" energy he's pursuing with this move. Not to mention the insecurity I might feel given he's in the city of hot beautiful successful women (I could myself as one of those types of women but I won't be physically present, and these other potential suitors will be).

Another factor is I'm kind of jealous of him. I was making plans to leave the city we currently live in myself, just for a place where I have citizenship (in Europe), because it's so hard to get a US work permit (though my first choice of a place to move has always been this Big Fancy City he's moving to, where I have spent some time).

I feel terribly frightened for my heart. Any and all advice appreciated.

TLDR: I'm falling in love with someone, we have a great connection, he's leaving, I don't know what to do.","Something my therapist told me years ago but stuck with me, is reminding me that connections like this can happen again.

Ok, so I'm two months into hitting the gym, and I'm loving it. I've gone consistently at least twice a week, and I've been as many as 5 days a week if my ex has the kids for the weekend and I don't have other commits.

So far I've dropped 15 pounds, down to 220. I'm 6' so 220 doesn't look bad on me, but I still have the dad bod. I've been talking to some friends about how to change that, and it looks like I pretty much need to change my diet, which is going to be a struggle. I'm not much of a cook and I've always been a picky eater, so I've got some work to do there. I'm trying to address the picky eater stuff in therapy (it's bordering on ARFID as I have an involuntary gag reflex with a lot of textures and some flavors, but I eat enough fried and processed garbage that I'm not malnourished, so technically it doesn't count). Despite our breakup (not the one from the OP, we got back together, had a wonderful month and a half together, then ended things amicably and are still friends), L is still going to help me learn to cook, so I'm working on that.

As far as how I'm feeling, it's fantastic. I have more energy, I can sprint up 3 or 4 flights of stairs at work without feeling winded, and I've never felt better about my body than I do now. I'm consistently running a mile in ~12-13 mins now, and I'm doing about 30 mins treadmill to start my workouts. I'm doing more sets of more reps or heavier weights, I'm benching and squatting ~110, I'm leg pressing ~200, and I can manage like 10 assisted pull ups with a ~100lb counterweight. 8 can also consistently hit 30 pushups, 30 situps, and most importantly, I can keep up with my kids without an issue.

Overall, it's been going super well for me, and it's really boosted my confidence. It's also given me a consistent reason to get out of the house and be among people (even though it's the gym and literally the most I've said to anyone is ""are you using that?""), which has been good for my depression too.

Looking ahead, for long term goals, in terms of fitness I want to get to ~200lbs, I want to drop 4 inches on my waist (from 36"" down to 32"") so I have a much wider selection of pants that fit. In terms of strength, I want to be able to bench and squat 200, and I want to be able to do 10 pullups without assistance. All of this seems achievable within the next 6-12 months so long as I consistently put in the work (and assuming I can improve my diet, which I'm trying but is really hard).

Most importantly, I'm taking time for myself consistently to do something I enjoy that makes me feel better about myself, and the importance of that can't be overstated.

I want to thank everyone who commented on the OP with advice and encouragement, the early days were really hard for me physically but your faith in me helped keep me going. This sub has been a wonderful place, and I'm really glad I found it.

We know dating can be frustrating and this is the place to talk about it.,"I've felt incredibly defeated this year (36, F) after going through yet another painful breakup back in the spring. In the past decade, I've now gone through 5 of these and it's always been the same/similar story-- the guy thinks he's ready for a relationship but realizes several months in (aka when an actual hurdle comes up) that he's not and runs. Admittedly in my 20s I wasn't as self-aware and ignored red flags, but the last 2 relationships I had were incredibly intentional on my end. I've done a ton of work on myself, therapy, dating coach, etc. I'm also a therapist myself. I hate the trope that we ""attract"" what we get b/c there honestly feels like no way to properly assess (unless I do a full intake upon meeting LOL) someone's emotional readiness/maturity until an actual opportunity for them to show it arises.

1. I have no problem watching TV with my girlfriend.  However, I have no desire to hold off indefinitely on watching a TV show with them.  If its a show like ""House of The Dragon"" that is on a certain day, I think there is a reasonable amount of time, maybe 2 days, to wait for them.  But if they have a busy week, etc, there is no reason we have to watch together.  Same with streaming shows.  No, I don't need to watch all of Cobra Kai the day it comes out.  But I'm not going to wait for you to finish 2 other shows before I start either.
2. I'm never going to be the guy who has to tell my girlfriend other people's business.  I'm fine not keeping secrets that effect us or our relationship.  But if I know something personal about my friend, I'm not telling her that info just to gossip.  If its not my secret to share, I'm going to be a trustworthy friend.

So last night we had a group hang, ordered food, and watched a movie. After the movie the others went home and her sister (who‚Äôs also her roommate) went up to bed. 

I lingered for a bit and once everyone was gone I asked if we could chat about something. I (probably a bit word-vomit-y because I was nervous!) told her that I really appreciate her as a friend and that our flirty dynamic (at least for me) has gotten a bit more serious. Then I asked how she‚Äôd feel about us exploring dating. 

She seemed pretty surprised at first and said ‚Äúyeah, we can do that‚Äù. I get the impression it wasn‚Äôt something she had super thought about before/ she was pretty taken aback by it. We spent a minute or so going ‚Äúyeah, ok‚Äù back and forth. I asked her how she was feeling about it all, and she brought up some concerns that I had flagged as well in my reflections: she‚Äôs not sure she‚Äôs as ready for something serious as I am/that she‚Äôll run away when things get serious, worried about hurting our friendship, and how we‚Äôd need to have a lot of open communication around everything as we move forward. 

We made a plan to go climbing Thursday (we usually go climbing once or twice a week together) and kinda left it at that. I could feel my face really flushed from nervousness/vulnerability, and we had a good hug and I left to head home. 

So overall generally (cautiously?) positive. We‚Äôll see how things land in a few days once she‚Äôs had more time to reflect. I‚Äôm feeling generally positive: I‚Äôm proud of my confidence, and glad I brought it up sooner rather than later. My flirtyness was turned up to 11 and I‚Äôm happy that I used my words instead of maybe leaving her more confused with a change in my behaviour ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø","In my very recent experience with seeing someone who said they were not sure what they wanted, I wish I had taken that more seriously.

Things progressed well until she withdrew and ultimately ended things, but not before coming back and then ghosting me.

datingoverthirty,zkc6sm,1670880711.0,Being completely vulnerable - I fear I'll be alone forever,"34M, soon turning 35, and I fear I'll never romantically connect with a member of the opposite sex again...Dating at this age is so challenging.  While I'm decent looking, have a good job, stable life, and interesting hobbies (I was both a professional chef and musician in the past, speak multiple languages, etc.), I just can't get much traction on OLD.

If that wasn't enough, I have a massive amount of baggage for someone my age.  I was married before, and my wife passed away at a very young age from Multiple Myeloma (bone marrow cancer).   The sad truth is, many women won't consider dating a widow (and I don't blame them).

How have you improved your attitude when it comes to dating at this age?  I want to be in love again, but I fear I won't ever have the chance","Have you worked thru your grief and loss of your late wife? Less people will have issues with someone being widow/widower than divorcee. The latter can be a crapshoot of mistakes and remaining ties and real baggage. The former is mostly about the person having processed the loss, and is ready to meet someone else again and rebuild a new life together. Perhaps it‚Äôs your attitude towards and assumption of ‚Äúwidower baggage‚Äù that‚Äôs hurting you in the dating pool. 

I had a different kind of past baggage but I went to talk therapy to work thru it and process it after it partially caused my last relationship to fail. 

I am also 34M, and the other thing that helps me is not thinking about my age and the pressure of ‚Äúaging‚Äù (and expected life milestones) while still dating age-appropriate women. Otherwise that comes across as desperation and rush into a relationship too fast too soon, and pushes dating prospects away. 

Others seem to have had good luck here posting snapshots of their profiles and getting constructive critiques."

Examples of issues:

- You‚Äôre not texting me enough/you‚Äôre texting me too much
- You never have time to meet up/you want to meet up too many times a week
- You‚Äôre flakey/late/take too long to reply/make plans too last minute 

Etc etc etc. The actual issue isn‚Äôt important. The point is, it‚Äôs an issue that could be a dealbreaker but isn‚Äôt a fundamental/unchanging thing (eg: wanting/not kids)

I have no idea how to communicate something like this when I only met the person a couple of times. On the other hand, if I say nothing, I‚Äôll either give up on the person, and go to the next date secretly annoyed.

Please don‚Äôt reply to this post saying ‚ÄúHey you text me too little/much, and I don‚Äôt like that‚Äù. It‚Äôs not helpful. I know I can physically text the person what I think. But I just can‚Äôt seem to find a way to text that doesn‚Äôt a) seem super serious for 3 dates in b) creates a bad vibe that makes the following date(s) awkward and/or make me/the person lose interest.

And while that might work for some people, I‚Äôve been single for 5 years now, so clearly I‚Äôve been exiting too early. I want to learn how to not throw the baby out with the bath water, and I think this phase of dating is a huge thing I need to improve on.","I‚Äôd use the getting to know you angle to communicate my preference. So for example, if they‚Äôre not texting enough on the next date I‚Äôd ask,

‚ÄúHey, so what‚Äôs your texting style?‚Äù

They‚Äôll of course let you know whatever their preference is and hopefully if they‚Äôre an actual keeper they‚Äôll ask ‚Äúwhat about you?‚Äù

In which case you can say, ‚ÄúI usually prefer x/y texting style because it makes me feel wanted/desired, etc‚Äù

It‚Äôs important to highlight how your preferred communication makes you feel because an attentive partner would pick up on that and would adjust accordingly. If they don‚Äôt then I‚Äôd move on since it‚Äôs still early enough. You can do this for any of the scenarios you listed there.

Initially, I wasn't open to the idea as I was still getting over a serious breakup but once that passed, I asked the family friend for her number.

We've been texting and that's been going well.  We had a video chat earlier today, which also went well but she said something during the video chat that threw me for a loop.  She asked if I ever had a girlfriend before and I told her I had.  She then told me she's never had a boyfriend, although she's always wanted one, and she's never even had her first kiss.  She did explain that she's been very driven in her education and her career and she is also very shy.  This led into a conversation about our priorities with work and life so we didn't linger on it but I am worried about it.

I've been in a number of serious relationships, including an engagement in my early twenties that ended when my ex-fianc√©e cheated on me.  I've also had two relationships that nearly had proposals but those didn't work out when it became apparent we wanted different things in life (a conversation I learned to have BEFORE the proposal due to how things ended with my ex-fianc√©).

Obviously, it's important to let things happen at a pace she's comfortable with (something that's true even if she had been in relationships before or if she wasn't a connected to a family friend) but I'm still concerned about our mismatch in dating experience.

If anyone has any advice or thoughts to keep in mind here, I'd greatly appreciate it.  Thank you!","I wouldn't overthink this one.  

Since she didn't *have* to tell you about this, I'm going to guess that she brought it up because it's something she feels a little insecure about, and maybe it's something that has scared other guys away. So this is your out if you need it.  

Otherwise, just treat her normally. Right or wrong, many women look to men to initiate/escalate affection and intimacy, so plan to get enthusiastic consent the way you would with any date, and just focus on vetting her the way you would any other match.  

I'm in a relationship with someone (33M) who hadn't been in a relationship except for a 1 year relationship when he was 24. He's an excellent partner, despite our difference relationship histories (I'm divorced, had a prior serious relationship before that).

Sometimes he has pretty strong opinions that are hurtful to hear and then later he will align with something that he was opposing before, or incorporate something I said in an argument into a statement he claims to believe. Other times he will agree with me verbally but still have a totally opposing belief that he acts on (like what time to leave for an event). I feel like I understand him by now but also like I have no idea who he is inside.

datingoverthirty,zjku4r,1670814382.0,People who are dating: do you want advice from people in relationships? People who are in long term relationships: do you think you give good advice?,"Bit of a two in one, but I thought it would be fun! (Meant to be light hearted, maybe a chance to vent a bit in good fun.)

I'm in a relationship of over two years and cohabitating (31 + 38) and only my second relationship lasting over a year. But I used this forum for a few years before then and found it incredibly helpful in my dating process. So I hope to give back with what I figure helped me.

However, I know I rarely liked advice from my friends in relationships. They didn't really understand dating culture or even how to date as they ended up with the first person they dated after long term relationships (small town). Plus hindsight bias and recency bias can really mess with accurate perceptions. 

So, folks in long term relationships, do you think you still got it for good advice?

Folks who are single, do you want advice from people in relationships? What advice do you think people in relationships are bad at giving?

(Again, all in good fun, so if people are having a bit of a vent let them have at it and don't take it too seriously.)","Here are the things couples say to me often, which are NOT helpful. Along with my rebuttals.

1. ""Sounds like you dodged a bullet!"" A very common attempt to try and flip a bad thing and treat it like a good thing instead of validating the person's (often understandable and completely valid) reaction to a bad dating experience.
2. ""Well being single doesn't solve ALL your problems. I still have problems!"" No one who wants to find a loving relationship claims it will solve every single one of their problems. It likely would solve some problems though. Like the problem of wanting a relationship and not having one. Also, if you think about big life problems, most people hope to navigate those WITH the support of a loving partner. I had a bunch of medical stuff happen this year. Having a partner wouldn't have prevented the medical things from happening. However, it would have provided another source of support during a time where I needed a ton of it.
3. ""Have you tried this dating app / that activity"" People in relationships simply do not know where to meet single people or how rarely you might meet someone who is a good fit, nor do they have to think about the intricacies of finding out if someone is single, doing a ring-check, flirting but not being heavy-handed in case this is someone you'll run into again, etc.
4. ""Well some relationships are really bad"" Yes and we're committed to trying to screen those out and leave bad situations. That doesn't really stop you from wanting a good relationship.
5. Edited to add one more... ""just freeze your eggs!"" Cool, how about you 'just' give me $15K. 

The only things people in relationships should be offering are:

1. taking good pictures of their single friends 2) inviting single people to events with lots of strangers 3) pre- or post-date hype/hang 4) keeping an eye out for people who fit what you're looking for"
datingoverthirty,zhw2n4,1670688182.0,Discussing hygiene with someone new,"I've been seeing someone for several weeks and things are going really well. This is the deepest ""same wavelength"" feeling I've had with anyone in a well over a decade, and we have so many overlapping common interests and experiences it's scary. This is the first person I've met where I don't feel like I'm compromising anything. She is *very* into me too and I have to confess that's doing some heavy lifting as well -- it's a really good feeling that I'm not at all used to. 

There's just one thing that's holding me back from being over the moon here: she doesn't smell good. It is obviously not enough to have prevented me from spending time with her for this long, but it's not great and I do think it impacts our physical chemistry. (The smell is like a mix of stress sweat and cat litter; the only time I've smelled something like it is when I briefly lived with an unneutered male cat.) It might be a personal hygiene thing, it might be that she is nose blind to her cats' smell getting in everything, or it might be that there's some kind of deep genetic incompatibility. 

I've noticed that she has said multiple times that I smell really good to her -- if this were some kind of genetic thing wouldn't it go both ways? So that gives me hope this is a fixable hygiene issue. On the other hand, she has a wide group of longtime friends she regularly sees and I know has had other romantic partners in the recent past -- if it were a hygiene thing then surely someone would have mentioned it to her already? 

I'm very tempted to just rip the bandaid off next time I see her and suggest she might be nose blind to the cats and ask how she feels about taking a day to deep clean her house together. I don't like to raise issues without a plan to be part of the solution. Does that sound like a good idea or am I way off here? I feel like the other option is just to abandon this without telling her why, because ""you smell bad so I'm out"" sounds pretty damn hurtful.

datingoverthirty,zhtg4n,1670681342.0,Advice for dating a friend?,"So I (32F) have been friends with a woman (37F) for several years now. We‚Äôre both queer. Over the years, we‚Äôve grown pretty close, text each other most days, and are generally there for each other. We‚Äôve gone on multiple-day hiking trips and gotten along great, and I feel calm, safe, and I really cherished by her. 

While we‚Äôve always had a little bit of a flirty relationship, I feel like recently the flirting has become a little bit more serious. There‚Äôs always been a bit of a question in my mind of maybe we should date but the last week or so I‚Äôve been much more consciously aware of the feelings. We hang out a few times last week and I found my flirty side coming out a lot more, touching her, wanting to be close to her, making more eye contact. We‚Äôre both single, dating, and ultimately looking for a long term relationship. I think the feelings maybe are coming up more now because this is the first time in a while we‚Äôre both single and dating at the same time (for a lot of our relationship she was dating someone and then taking time to heal after the relationship). 

So DoT, what thoughts, advice, cautions, or well-wishes do you have for possibly broaching dating a friend? I think I‚Äôll just bring it up next time we hang out that I feel like the vibe has changed and the flirting feels a bit more serious and ask how she feels about it as I‚Äôm generally a direct person. On the other hand, part of me wants to just gradually up the flirting, be more touchy and close to her, and see how that goes. 

I‚Äôm not super concerned about losing the friendship over bringing feelings up as we‚Äôre both pretty mature. Yes there‚Äôs always the possibility that we start dating but then have an ugly break up and she‚Äôs not in my life anymore, but again I know she has exes who are friends, and I‚Äôve been able to stay good friends with some of my exes as well, particularly if we were friends before.","I‚Äôve seen this play out in my own friend group several times over. The transition from friends to lovers often works because of that solid emotional and trust base. I usually see an upping of flirtation, an escalation into closeness before someone makes a real move and asks to go on a date/be in a relationship. If you can feel your friend flirting back with you, that‚Äôs a great sign. I think you should make a real move soon! Best of luck. My only caution would‚Äôve been risking the friendship, but you seem pretty confident that will still be there. So by all means, go for it!"

And I've been thinking about something I listened to about change, rebirth, etc.

How do you really believe that good things are coming and put yourself ""in alignment"" for that mentally/emotionally? 

I know that being in my 30s and not having or wanting kids (also can't) and having kids as an automatic deal breaker will limit me, in addition to the other things that I would filter for (being treated well, common values and goals, good rapport). How do I really maintain a positive mindset?

How do I get to feeling like love--real, lifelong love that endures, where we are continually growing and changing together, towards each other--is actually possible?

Yes I realize I‚Äôm being paranoid, and will most likely just go with my gut here. But mostly I want to know what could possibly be an incentive if this being a fake person or catfish. Or is this person just really only into meeting IRL and I should just man up and go?

Have been in a committed relationship for 3/4 months now.

I have noticed my gf and me have been having some conversations and discussions about the frequency of seeing each other.

For me as an introvert, i tend to find 2 and sometimes 3 times a week more than enough. I'm quite the introvert and really like having me-time to spend as i see fit. Whether it is by going to the gym (which is on a bit of a hold due to health issues) or just plain being a lazy potato and checking youtube/movies and playing videogames, without being in the presence of another person or in this case my girlfriend or the occassional hanging out with friends.

My girlfriend on the otherhand is an extrovert. It seems she doesn't really understand my needs as an introvert and always try's to sneak in extra days to see each other. Even though i tell her i like spending time with her, as said above, i also NEED my me-time.

She is constantly trying to push the boundaries and is in turn, turning me quite agitated at the fact that she says yes when i explain her loud and clear what my needs are, for her to just try and cross the same boundaries again the next week.

This has lead to some hefty discussions in her saying: ""But you already had two days alone this week, i don't understand what the problem is. I guess i want to see you more than you want to see me and i put in all the effort"".

Advice? Similar situations?

I don't want to throw the towel in the ring, but i also don't see myself having this weekly discussion and having to stand my ground, every single time that we are arranging dates to see each other.

1. There were 3-4 1 min awkward silences in a span of 2 hours. 
2. When I finished paying for the meal & drinks she left for the bathroom for 10 mins
3. Compared to other dates i‚Äôve been on I feel like we laughed at things, but not like super hard laughs that i‚Äôve experienced with others
4. I awkwardly chocked on a Jalape√±o for like 3-4 mins lol I tried to play it off, but def was awkward

6. I asked her if she wanted me to walk her to her car. She said no i‚Äôm parked really close. I‚Äôm assuming that‚Äôs bad. Usually girls say yes IME
7. No signs or conversations about hanging out again
8. As of now no text since date (it‚Äôs been 1 hour as of now)

Some good things I can note
1. We talked a lot. She only looked at her watch once lol
2. It wasn‚Äôt one sided we both asked questions about eachother

What are your guys thoughts on this date, is this signs that it went bad or am I overthinking? What are your thoughts on signs that a date went bad?

We tend to text quite a bit for a few days at a time, then won‚Äôt talk for another couple of days. I find texting exhausting if I don‚Äôt know someone well, but prefer it more consistently as the relationship develops (not constantly, but it‚Äôs nice to hear from someone once a day, and I also make an effort to initiate so it‚Äôs not one-sided). I‚Äôm struggling a bit since our communication cadence between dates hasn‚Äôt evolved.

Do you tend to text more frequently as you‚Äôve been seeing someone longer, or do you text with the same frequency regardless (based on your own preferences)?","Mine doesn‚Äôt increase or decrease over time. I mesh best with people who text conversationally but are fine with picking that conversation up and put it down as we need to because, you know, life. A few texts a day is plenty for me.

datingoverthirty,zg8sdb,1670527730.0,Just realized that important details weren‚Äôt visible.,"So I‚Äôve been on Hinge for a couple weeks. 37M, I took it seriously after multiple times just checking out the apps. The photos were intentional and I even used my full name (my name is very unique and I am pretty much the only Google result). I even went as far as to use a pic which made it clear that kids are in my life.     

I‚Äôve made some matches and have been chatting. At this point I am ready to plan some dates and I just realized that the children, as in ‚ÄúHas children‚Äù was not visible.    

I imagine that the app still filters on details even if they are hidden but it does make it seem like these interactions have been disingenuous. So I‚Äôm not sure what to do here. Delete and try again later? Or, is there a way to broach this topic and salvage these matches?","I'd just bring it up at some point before meeting. ""Also, just wanted to check with you because I didn't realise until recently that my child status was hidden in my details. I have children - hope that's not a deal-breaker for you?""

We have talked a lot on the phone and finally met up for a first date recently. It went amazing but after everything changed. He started getting upset BC I am not a frequent texter and immediately wanted to know when we can make plans for our next date. I've been single awhile and I just like to have time and space to process everything and I have a life (we also live in separate cities but not too far away). As things are going I feel pressure almost to be his girlfriend, rather do girlfriend things or I'll lose him entirely. This weird stubborn immature side of him really surprised me as he seemed so laid back and chill. I feel stressed and like if I don't respond to his texts and pick up when he calls he will get upset and hurt again and we will get in an argument ...as well did right after our wonderful night together. I'm just wondering if I'm over thinking? But it seems way too soon to talk about going somewhere for the weekend together and I was kind of freaked out that he was upset I didn't cancel my plans with friends to stay and hangout longer. I do really really like him, and potentially could be happy with him but I'm nervous about all of this wanting to talk all the time and pressure to schedule a date. Maybe I'm just not used to ""normal"" but im freaking out a little bit. He's military so idk if that's where the stubborn behavior is from or the fact that he's a bit younger. I just want to keep talking and getting to know people and I feel like it got real serious real quick with him and idk quite how to handle it. He said he felt like he liked me way more than I liked him and idk I like him a lot, I had a wonderful time, I'm just very cautious due to past relationships and abuse. He's already asking why I can't just come stay with him or why I'm not down to hangout everyday... Am I just scared of commitment? Or should I find a way to distance myself? I don't want to necessarily but I am concerned if he's expressing this insecurity now...what would a future look like?

datingoverthirty,zfnhkx,1670469947.0,Do you have a dating new years resolution?,"I have a few:

1. Texting more and trying to have a phone call first, so that I ultimately go on fewer dates that I am more excited about.
2. Limiting swiping and messaging to 15 minutes every day right before I go to the gym.
3. Journaling about how my dates felt using Logan Ury's 8 questions (ETA here are the questions: [https://www.instagram.com/p/Cl4SvuIvjvf/?hl=en](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cl4SvuIvjvf/?hl=en))

What are yours?","I am currently taking a break from dating until the new year (and attempting to get over some seemingly-unrequited feelings in the meanwhile) so I'm glad you've posted this and made me think about it! Here are mine:

1. **Prioritize making new platonic friends and nourishing existing friendships** ***before*** **investing time into apps**: I have been feeling pretty isolated in my job and don't have much of a social life or community here, so I think it would be good if I put energy into healthy friendships first, instead of exclusively focusing my attention and energy on dating and finding ""the one"". 
2. **Try to match with more profiles I feel enthusiastic about and try to go on more dates in general**: I've been super picky on OLD, and I think maybe it would be helpful if I tried to go on more dates just to get to know a broader range of people. 
3. **Start more conversations and be okay if they don't lead anywhere:** I got pretty discouraged the last time around on the apps because a lot of my efforts at conversation would lead nowhere or I'd ultimately get ignored. Maybe if I try initiating conversations with more people, I'll have a bit more luck in the numbers game, and I won't feel so let down when the guys I get excited about don't respond.
4. **Be patient with myself:** I don't *think* I'm doing anything egregiously wrong when it comes to OLD, but when things don't work out with a given match I have a tendency to internally worry and fixate about why I'm not ""enough"" and what might be wrong with me. That doesn't seem particularly productive, so I think I'll try to focus more on moving right along whenever someone decides I'm not for them."

Thoughts?

Don't expect to do the whole meet the family at Christmas thing, they're not big on family, though they do see their family quite a bit for someone who claims not to be very family oriented. They aren't interested in romantic partners getting too involved with their family, for personal reasons that I'm aware of and completely understand. I'm not big on my partner being involved with family either, so that's not a bridge I care about crossing either way, if and when it happens I'm neutral.","I wouldn‚Äôt invite someone I‚Äôve been dating for 6 months to a work party or a family Christmas.

I havent experienced this before so i didnt protest. Ive been worried straight for months and he doesnt say if hes ok when i ask. Replies about all other things but that. Did indicate that he‚Äôd look forward to meeting when back. And, more recently, even regular replies have dwindled and now im worried further. He could have met someone. Totally fine. But i dont want to be in dark anymore on whether all this is because hes not ok or cos he had met someone. I am ok with giving space if hes simply not ok (i understand that as a non-gf nothing i can do to help) but I recently told him im not seeing others cos ive been thinking of him. No reply. So much could be happening on his side but also hoping all is well and hes acrually just not interested! Crazy that i want him and his family to just be alright!

I'm already in therapy, and my therapist is helping me work through feelings of insecurity and my tendency to ruminate. I tend to the worst outcome scenario when I mess up or see a negative sign in the relationship. I'm a guy, so I try to act confident and avoid insecure/needy behavior. It's good to have space, but, I t do get needy while dating someone. I never expected to feel like this as a 40 y.o. Man! I thought I had outgrown these kinds of feelings.   


I want more time with my current girlfriend (of 8 months), but she's a teacher, has most of the responsibility for her 7 y.o., lives with her parents, and wants her own space. I'm a professor with a very flexible schedule and have 50/50 custody with my 7 y.o. daughter (also, my ex is a great parent). The Friday she has without her son, she spends with me. Sometimes, we also often spend time together on Tuesdays when we both don't have our kids.  


Does anyone ever feel this way? How do you work through needy feelings and feelings about the relationship ending? Today I'm in a very logical space where I know it would be fine if this relationship didn't work out. We're both good people and would find another relationship. I know I'd fall in love again. In other words, it would be okay if we broke up (even though I don't want that).","I‚Äôd try to distinguish desires, needs, and insecurities.

You can want to see your partner more and express that without it being needy.  That‚Äôs being assertive!  It‚Äôs then in your partner‚Äôs court to decide if they can match you, or you negotiate something you can both live with. If your partner says she can‚Äôt make more time, the ball is back in your court. You get to decide if you can live with the status quo or you‚Äôd be happier in anorher relationship.

The ‚Äúneediness‚Äù or insecurity comes in when you forget that you have a choice to walk away rather than accept what they offer."

Both of my brothers' daughters ask me EVERY TIME I see them. My friends bring it up regularly. It's starting to bother me to an extent that it hasn't before, and I know that if I say something about it and tell people to stop fucking pointing out my singleness every chance they get, I'm just going to look like a stick in the mud. But I heard it multiple times this weekend at what should have just been a fun and relaxing get-together. 

There's the friend who is flabbergasted that I haven't hooked up with any of the girls in my masters program (I'm 38 years old and I've got a good 10-15 years on all of them). Another is just ""what gives! How are you single! Hurry the fuck up!"" (not her words, but that was certainly the meaning behind what she said. As someone who got married to her high school sweetheart, I can imagine what a failure I must be in her eyes as a 38 year old unmarried guy) As for my nieces, they're just too young to see reason. If I try to have a civil conversation with them about please not bothering me about my singlehood, they'll literally forget it happened the next time they see me. Actually they'll probably ask me 10 times as much just to annoy me about it, as my nieces just love to annoy me. Sometimes it's cute. This time, it definitely isn't.

For the record, I DON'T feel like a failure. I've done very well for myself, about to graduate with a masters degree in Biostatistics in May and hopefully work at a hospital and work on life-saving treatments and what not. That's more important to me than literally anything else, money, social status, any of that shit.

datingoverthirty,zdr9qp,1670290956.0,Partner not asking questions,"Hi all, I've been dating a lovely guy for several weeks (we're both in our mid-late 30s) and I know he's genuinely into me, respects me, shows me a lot of care and interest in a variety of ways. However, he isn't great at showing curiosity or interest by asking questions about me. I'm a person who is very comfortable talking about myself openly so I've shared a lot of info with him about myself. I know he's interested in me because he generally listens attentively, remembers things about me, takes me on really thoughtful dates, takes an interest in things I share with him (music, movies, media etc), and is very expressive about what he likes about me specifically. That being said, I'm still so irked by the fact that he doesn't typically ask questions. I'm not saying I need him to ask me 20 questions and I get many details about a person can be picked up organically in conversation; but I do feel kinda put off when he doesn't show more curiosity about my interests, history, friends, work etc without me starting the conversation myself. I'm also not saying he never asks questions--he definitely does--but it's a lot less than other people I've been with.

I'd really like him to take the lead on asking more since it would make me feel more appreciated and cared for. I actually did talk to him about this recently and he was very receptive and understanding, and I have seen an effort on his part, but it's less than I've experienced with other people I've dated. In spite of this, I really, really like this guy and I'm developing deeper feelings for him because of the things we have in common, his care towards me, our shared values, attraction, and we always have an amazing time together. I feel very wanted, cared for, and prioritized, but this one issue keeps eating at me. I'm not sure what to do. I haven't met someone I've liked this much in such a long time and I truly feel cared for, and I'm struggling with this issue.

I'm wondering if anyone else has encountered this in a relationship and what you did to try to resolve the issue and if it helped. Any advice would be appreciated! Thanks!

TL; DR: new partner not asking many direct questions, shows me tons of care/appreciation/interest in many other ways, but it's bothering me a lot that he doesn't ask more questions to get to know me--what can I do?","One thing I will say is that you can't get 100% of what you want. Now, I'm not saying that anyone should settle, but rather ask yourself, ""if this guy is great in all other aspects, can I live with the 10% of him that isn't ""great""?"" The answer could be yes or no, depending on how important that 10% is and what it consists of. No one is perfect.

My partner is really not great at words of affirmation. We talked about it, he was receptive, but it's still nowhere near what I would like. I've just accepted that this is how he is, and he is great in all other areas. It does bother me, but not enough to break up with him."
datingoverthirty,zdfsxj,1670266445.0,How do I know if it's actual no chemistry or just my own personal issues/fears?,"Backstory is that I've spent 2021 and 2022 doing online dating pretty seriously after doing a lot of self improvement in 2020, I've decided I'm ready for a long term relationship. Within those two years I've probably had about 30 first dates. Rough numbers are

* About 24 have not progressed to a second date, usually my decision or mutual. This happens when I don't feel any chemistry or spark after the first date, where a second date to me would feel forced
* About 3 have ended after the second date with similar feelings about no chemistry/spark
* About 2 I have wanted a second date but the other person declined
* And 1 progressed to a real relationship which lasted 4 months, but was ended due to a difference in long term goals

My problem is that I feel like 27/30 dates ending with no chemistry or spark very early. I keep hearing you should give a 2nd date a chance but I just really hate the feeling of forcing something if it's not there initially. Is this normal or does it point to a bigger issue I need to work on? What does valid ""no chemistry"" actually describe?","Whenever I ran into this it was usually a screening problem on my end - i.e. I was accepting dates with a lot of people who I was ambivalent about in the first place. Are you finding yourself excited before date one and then not in person or are you just casting a wide net? I personally don't think there's anything wrong with the wide net approach as long as you do feel you could be genuinely interested in someone, but it may lead to more dates without chemistry than really honing in on people you're very into."

datingoverthirty,zddsep,1670262411.0,The ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not ready‚Äù excuse,"This is long so please bear with me. Met this guy on OLD and we hit it off immediately. He told me he‚Äôs looking for a friend ‚Äúand seeing where it goes.‚Äù I told him that I could use a good friend, too. The initial connection was strong so we quickly exchanged numbers and went off the app. 

We live about two hours apart so didn‚Äôt meet for 2 weeks. During that time, we texted daily and talked on the phone a bit. We both admitted that our chemistry together is unique and unlike anything we‚Äôve experienced. I felt like I‚Äôve known him forever and he told me the same. And this was before we even saw each other. 

So, we meet, and the connection is still there, even stronger. We talked for a few hours and I left. He later texted me that he wanted to kiss me but wasn‚Äôt sure how I would react. I told him he should have. All is well, but we are still very much ‚Äúfriends‚Äù at this point. We text and talk daily, but he is still telling me that he‚Äôs currently not ready for a relationship (he told me this several times, even before we met). I signed up for this and it‚Äôs not like he lied to me or led me on so I‚Äôm definitely not upset with him. 

Another 2 weeks or so after we met, I went to his city with family. He asked me if I‚Äôd like to go over to his place and so I did. We ended up hooking up and I stayed at his place until 4 in the morning. It wasn‚Äôt just sex, we talked a lot. Now, I‚Äôve been divorced for years and haven‚Äôt been intimate with anyone so this was a pretty big deal for me. And he knew that. 

He continues to tell me that I‚Äôm ‚Äúperfect‚Äù and the most beautiful and kindest person he‚Äôs ever met. He told me while the sex was great, it‚Äôs not what he‚Äôs most attracted to about me and he‚Äôd give up the sex if it meant I‚Äôd still stay in his life. I asked him about not wanting a relationship with me (again lol) and he told me he‚Äôs just not there yet and it has nothing to do with me. He‚Äôs not ready financially or emotionally. I‚Äôve always heard and read that if a man wants you, nothing can stop him and that ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not ready‚Äù is just an excuse. 

My question is this: would ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not ready‚Äù in this case be justified? I can tell that he truly does like me but I can‚Äôt help but think that if he truly wanted me, he would make it work. 

Note: I‚Äôm still meeting other men while he‚Äôs not seeing or talking to anyone. 

Edit to add: A few days ago he was getting ready to go somewhere and I teased him by asking if he‚Äôs going on a date. He said, ‚ÄúNo, if I was taking anyone out, it would be you.‚Äù ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

**Another ETA: Again, I‚Äôm thankful for all the caring comments. You‚Äôre all the best! At the risk of being perceived as arrogant, I feel like I need to say the following: he told me himself that he is insecure and that what I see about him is not what he sees (his exact words). I‚Äôm honestly not only a catch physically, but I‚Äôm also highly educated with a promising career. I‚Äôm stable in every way. He is not.

**Please note that we both come from cultures that prioritize men being the main providers and the heads of households.**","There are so many people on dating apps (and in the wild too, I suppose) who want the benefits of a relationship without actually being in a relationship. They want someone to flirt with and text throughout the day. They want someone who will check in about how their day was. They want someone they can hang out with. They want someone they can kiss and have sex with . . . but as soon as you want to define it, suddenly they're ""Not ready"" even though they're on the dating apps, actively looking for someone before they met you and they were ready to chat with you and kiss you and have sex with you but they're not ready for  . . . what exactly?  

It's like intentionally driving to the grocery store, bringing cash, having a list you've prepared, having coupons that you've clipped, filling your cart up with items and then suddenly saying ""These groceries are great.

datingoverthirty,zcxwwd,1670217751.0,"Guy I am seeing was very positive last time we spoke, but now time is passing and hasn‚Äôt been in touch.","I [32F] started seeing this guy [29M] two months ago and we have both indicated on our profiles that we are looking for a relationship. 

Up until last Sunday, everything seemed to be going very well. He was not the biggest texter, but would check in throughout the week once or twice (to me this is great and enough) and would respond enthusiastically when I check up on him. We would exchange photos or ask how week is going, did you catch some sleep (he starts work extremely early, etc) 

He is from a different cultural background and he was raised in a restrictive society until he started uni, for what that is worth. He has been to my house 3-4 times, the first time we didn‚Äôt even cuddle, we just watched a movie and he fell asleep. The last few times, he has been spending the night and we have cuddled a lot, but not had sex. I have not been against it, I am just okay with whatever he is comfortable with and leading with. E.g, one time, during cuddling, I turned around and kissed him on the lips, and he kissed me back, but did not continue. He kisses my neck and cheek and nuzzles it and he kissed my lips as a goodbye last time I saw him.

He was big on acts of service without me asking at all. The last 1-2 dates, I was the one initiating the dates and inviting him. So this week I decided to step back, I checked in on him twice throughout the week, he responded quickly and pretty positively and was very sweet, but he didn‚Äôt ask me any questions back. To me this felt off, because he usually checks in at least once on his own. And now it feels like he has ghosted me.

For what it is worth, the last time I saw him last weekend, he was sweet and affectionate. He held my hand, cuddled me, rested his head on my lap as he sometimes does, gave me compliments on my perfume and dress. I know it sounds cheese, but it seemed genuine.

What to do now, do I wait for him to see if he remembers I exist? I already checked up on him twice and thought to allow him some spce, as he works a lot and still last week he spent two nights at mine. I don‚Äôt insist for him to stay over, he just does. 

Any advice?","If you have to ask yourself if he is into you, I think you know the answer. You are worth so much more than waiting around for a man."
datingoverthirty,zcxctz,1670216073.0,Some personal woes of dating with ADHD,"To be clear, I‚Äôm happier and more in tune with who I am than ever before in my life. Somehow that‚Äôs translated to a far tougher time than ever before in the dating world though. I‚Äôm mostly just a bit blue about it all at the moment. 

After a fling ended with someone who was an extremely influential part of my life mid summer, I decided to stop actively dating. I‚Äôve been focusing on myself and enjoying my life while remaining open to real life connections that happen along the way. I‚Äôve been enjoying this approach far more than my previous approach with dating apps and overwhelming numbers games. 

That said, I‚Äôve had a few first dates recently that brought up some frustrating feelings. Basically, I think I‚Äôm a catch but I suck at the initial stages of dating and feel like I sabotage every opportunity to get to know someone new.

Even with medication, I have very poor listening skills and have struggled to improve over the years. I am eager to relate to new people and find common ground, so when they say something that sparks a memory of mine, I have a hard time active listening and letting conversation flow as I get very excited to share the personal story their words stirred up within me. When I truly stop to listen to someone, I tend to be clueless on what to do with the conversation once they finish speaking since I either missed part of what they said, or am unsure how to follow up. This makes me come off as someone who is self absorbed and constantly talking too much about myself.

I have a hard time understanding how/why people seem so keen to be any level of inauthentic to make the other believe there is a high level of common ground and shared interest. I prefer to tell someone that I‚Äôm not a huge fan of a certain music genre they enjoy than pretend that I like it when I don‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt need to share those types of superficial level interests with people and am more excited at the prospect of learning something new from them! It‚Äôs very confusing to me when people act interested in what I‚Äôm speaking about when, in reality, it‚Äôs not a topic they are passionate about. 

I‚Äôm an intelligent person but happen to work in a retailer setting. I‚Äôve been with the company for nearly a decade, have an unbelievable community among my peers, amazing benefits, and am overall able to afford a comfortable lifestyle even after dropping down to part time employment. I have hobbies and passions outside my work and have long term goals to start a new career path which I‚Äôm taking active steps towards. I still feel that my dates regularly judge my line of work and the fact that I speak so much about my job and my peers as if I‚Äôm inferior for not having a flashier career or lack financially stability. I hate feeling as if I must defend the fact that despite working retail part time, I‚Äôm still able to afford to live a comfortable life alone in a two bedroom apartment, with a cat, and an decent financial safety net. 

I earn supplemental income teach pole dance classes and also get the vibe that I‚Äôm judged for that too. As if these men have a handful of ideas around what a woman who pole dances is like (better or worse) and that either way, I don‚Äôt live up to the expectation. 

I struggle with timeliness and am generally 2-15 minutes late *everywhere* to the point that I have a formal accommodation with my job due to this specific issue with time management being connection to my ADHD. I‚Äôve gotten *far* better with it but it will always be an issue. It‚Äôs obviously not a good look to make someone wait on me in the initial dating stages and it certainly doesn‚Äôt help me out any. 

I‚Äôm an exceptionally thoughtful and attentive partner once I‚Äôm in an established relationship but now that I‚Äôve learned how to avoid clear toxic/abusive situations I feel like I have no success with healthy individuals because my ADHD screams red flags or something. 

Aside from hiring some type of social skills coach to practice talking less and listening more without making things sound like I‚Äôm conducting an interview, I don‚Äôt know how to put my best foot forward and show potential partners that I am indeed someone who‚Äôs worth giving a chance. That I am as worthwhile as I appeared when we happened upon each other in whatever real life situation. 

How can I get better at these first few  dates with people and be given a genuine opportunity to show them the awesome person they decided to ask out in the first place!?","So first things first.  It sounds like you have identified a lot of weak points in your behavior.  It does sound like you're trying to address them, which is good.  So many people figure out all these things than use them as excuses.  They explain our behavior, not excuse them and I'm happy that you're taking steps and putting in the work to figure it out.

That being said, it sounds like you have a hard time understanding passion.  Passion is a universal language, something that binds us all together.  When people 'fake interest' in things you do or talk about, it has nothing to do with the activity itself and entirely to do with your passion for those things.

Relationships are mostly about shared history, right?  That's what makes them so powerful.  When you start a new relationship, you lack that shared history so we often try to 'fake it' by either talking about things we both like (You love Alice in Chains?  I FUCKING LOVE ALICE IN CHAINS?!?).  Lacking that, we instead focus on common emotions and feelings.  Passion is one of the easiest to pick up on.  I could give a fuck less about perfume but if we're vibing then I will listen to you talk about sillage all night long.

Passion is easy to understand because we all experience it.  We often, as humans, find it attractive when other people are passionate about things.  It's an easy way to bond.  The best thing you can do is try to stop worrying about why they care about the things you're into and realize that they're just into the idea that you're into something.

Anyways...

Last thing I'll state is the rest of your post is basically just dating for everyone.  The point of dating is to keep poking around until you find someone who is into you, whoever you might be.  If someone looks down on your profession or who you are or how you have decided to live your life...then they're just letting you know they're not your person.  Try not to lose sleep over people who wouldn't have been part of your happiness anyways."

datingoverthirty,zcehcq,1670172170.0,Ghosted by FWb and despite the nature of the relationship it sucks.,"TLDR I‚Äôve been ghosted by my friend with benefits and it hurts, more than I expected it to. I had no expectations for this relationship to be or become romantic but I thought we really enjoyed each others company (many of the same interests and we‚Äôd laugh at each others jokes all the time) and liked hanging out beyond just the sex. He would remark about how easy it was to be comfortable around me and how great it was that we got along so well and that we actually felt like friends, he‚Äôd really miss me when I left and would visit me, etc etc. We were 2 hours apart but had been getting together more or less regularly since around June (he comes to my area for his work). It was the first regular sexual relationship I had since a sh\*tshow of a breakup in March. 

  
I am moving several states away and we were supposed to get together one last time this past weekend. Long story short, he forgot. I told him that being forgotten about sucked because I‚Äôd thought we liked each other as people, too (and I didn‚Äôt say this part but if that were actually the case I‚Äôm pretty damn sure he wouldn‚Äôt have forgotten we were supposed to have a last hurrah). A couple of days later (so in hindsight I suspect he had been wavering on ghosting me even then) he apologized and said he ‚Äúreally fucked up‚Äù but didn‚Äôt say anything about the other part of the concern I brought up. So I elaborated a bit on it, and I have for sure been ghosted. 

  
What really hurts is feeling lied to. If it was just transactional- fine. But be up front about that and don‚Äôt make me think you also liked me as a person just because you think it will get you more of what you want in the moment. I have some pretty painful trust issues from my breakup and this feels like a setback. I know some people are going to think it sounds like I had feelings for this guy but I don‚Äôt, it‚Äôs really not about that. It‚Äôs just about wanting to feel liked/respected enough for honesty and to not be disposable enough to be ghosted- I guess this kind of thing is common these days but it's making me feel really discouraged about basic decency being a thing in either casual or romantic situations (have had a couple of other FWB attempts this year that ended in ghosting as well). I don‚Äôt know what the solution is, other than not trusting anything anyone says as a rule- which isn‚Äôt how I want to live. I‚Äôm not even sure what I‚Äôm looking for with this post but I feel so sad right now that people can be like this and frustrated with it being my norm as of late.","I think feeling angry that this guy ghosted you is a perfectly valid and rational response.

In July, we matched, had great chemistry, and I thought she was really beautiful. We had planned on a date, but it fell apart after an awkward video call (I told her in advance I suck at them), and a scheduling issue with her starting work and me going out of the country. She had said maybe we'd connect later down the line, but I figured that was just an easy goodbye, which was fine.

I've posted plenty of times about this, but I fractured my pelvis on that out of the country trip, and I'm dealing with a yet to be resolved and unrelated nerve or back issue that's preventing me from exercising and getting back to full strength. I'm a functioning human being, but at like... 65-70% of my normal self. I can't run or walk long distances, and I've put on a little weight (like 10-15 lbs).

They conceived the child after they broke up and he found out she was pregnant. She moved back in their home country in Europe. He stayed working as a expat. A few years later he moved to Europe but not to the same country as his kid. We met a few years later.
I was surprised that he wasn't driven to live in the same country as his kid to spend more time with him. His reply when questioned was that work opportunities are better where he is and that he doesn't feel at ease in his home country. He manages to see his kid during school holidays.

datingoverthirty,zavg5y,1670010185.0,"Hinge matches tend to drop off after I ask for a date, then come back a few days later. How come?","I am newly back to dating after six months off following a difficult breakup.

I'm more or less happy with my first two weeks back on Hinge. I'd say I'm okay looking, certainly not a model but I have enough conversations that I've found 3-4 women I'd like to actually take on a date.

However, I'm running into a frustrating pattern when it comes to asking women out:

* We match and talk for 4-5 days. I like to establish that we have some rapport. Plus, I've generally found that if a woman is still responding to me 4-5 days out, she's probably just waiting for me to ask her out.
* I'm very direct about asking for a date so that there's no room for misinterpretation. No ""We should hang out sometime"" or ""Let's meet up"", etc. I say ""I'd love to take you on a date."" I also try to ask mid-week (Wednesday/Thursday) so that we can make plans.
* The woman, who was responding the same day up to that point, doesn't respond for \~2-3 days.
* Almost always, she does agree to a date ‚Äì¬†just days later.

I know it may be weird to complain about this, because I'm still getting dates in the end, but it's frustrating! It makes it really hard to plan my weekend with friends and/or other dates. The change in communication feels like being ghosted, to the point where I assume I won't hear from someone and move on emotionally. It also colors how I see someone because I feel like making someone wait days when you're clearly using the app regularly is...well, rude.

Instead, it feels like I now have to squeeze an extra date in with someone who doesn't seem that invested in me, because she took a while to respond and I already have another date or plans with friends. And, while I've experienced this before, it was rare; whereas it's happening enough this time around that I'm wondering what I could do differently.

If I had to guess, I would assume that most of these women have a guy they're actually waiting on/prioritizing, and don't want to agree to a first date with me until their other plans are settled. That, or I'm being too direct (I am looking for something serious, so perhaps that makes the stakes feel higher)? What do y'all think?

I won't be seeing my therapist much longer due to a cost change (and we reached a natural pause), but today she told me she thinks I'm doing harm to myself by dating and that I should take a step back from dating.

Some of my issues have been that I get into a cycle where I go onto the apps, I start chatting with some likely candidates, but I start to get too critical to give them a real chance (""I can't tell if I'm attracted to him"", ""his conversation is boring"") and I don't actually believe anything will come of it and even though I plan dates and show up and am personable, I'm already looking for a way for the potential relationship to blow up by the third date, so that I can go back to being alone.  

I know, I know, those poor guys who I have given a glimmer of hope to before inevitably giving the slow fade, or possibly the slightly more adult text, ""Hey, I'm sorry to do this, but I've realized that I really shouldn't be dating right now, and I'm going to need to take a step back and work on myself.""

I put up barriers and don't accept that to have a close connection with someone, I need to let them get close to me.

>This guy is challenging me which I like (and need right now) 

My advice, which you're absolutely not going to take, is end things because you don't seem in the right mind set **at all** for a fling.

Someone ""challenging you"" is what you look for in a longterm partner. The fact that you attribute this to him already means you're approaching this from a non-fling angle.

**And if it makes you feel alive, it's going to make you feel extra dead when it ends**. Period. Guaranteed. And it will, becuase you've already clocked it and simply don't want to accept it.

I honestly wish someone would invent time travel just for this sub b/c anyone who's gone through trying to talk themselves through ""accepting casual when what I want with them is serious"" never gets through it the way they imagine (the way they want us to assure them can happen) - somehow being calm, cool gal, open minded. 

No... it always ends up with a denial of the situation, upset that getting to know you didn't change their mind, super upset when they get with someone else even though that was always the likeliest trajectory, etc. Most people seem to regret going that route. Myself included. 

So try to think of yourself as time traveling from the future and ask if this is definitely the route.

>but I guess I‚Äôm not sure he‚Äôs ‚Äúemotionally available‚Äù. We wanna hang for hot sex but looks like we aren‚Äôt going to build anything.

Not to play super psychologist since that isn't my day job, but to reiterate that you're all over the place, you're not SURE he's emotionally available,"" which indicates that you haven't discussed this (or you'd be sure), yet you're *already using* language that implies a united unit that's come to a decision (""we wanna hang for..."") .

Usually, it was always a joyful period for me, a time to slow down and just live even when I was on my own. I am a rather independent and introverted person and always could and still can be on my own. But this holiday season is freaking me out.

Now I'm still processing our break up, I am on a healing journey, in therapy and overall had a lot of loss and grief this past year: my father died and I couldn't go to his funeral, I can't go and visit my mom, I went through a break-up and a major hair loss which might not be over yet. 

All my friends are partnered up and have plans. I know loneliness is a state of mind and I never felt this way before but I can't help but feel it. I also don't want to find an artificial company just not be alone. I struggle to be motivated on dating apps even after the break I took from them.

Long story short she cancelled 2 dates short notice and then stood me up. No explanation or anything. She checked all the boxes for me and our conversation/connection at least through texting and calls was really good. So I was pretty bummed when it didn‚Äôt happen. 

But here we are 4 months later and she messaged me asking to talk. She told me the ‚Äútoxic‚Äù boyfriend she had for 3 years came back around while she was talking to me and convinced her to try again. She admitted she made a huge mistake not communicating with me what was happening and that she was sorry. She actually apologized in a few different messages while telling me what happened and gave me enough detail to believe she is sincere. 

After all that she says she would like to meet me and start out as friends. I am open to it because I felt we are compatible. I know I am now one of those people who is looking for advice when they are pretty much just going to do what they are going to do‚Ä¶ but has anyone went through a similar situation? How did it go? Should I try this out? Am I an idiot? Well. Yes.","Here‚Äôs what happened and is going to happen:

She was more interested in another guy so she kept standing you up. Other guy bruised her ego by not wanting to be with her. She‚Äôs coming back to you to feel better about herself. You‚Äôre going to allow her to come back. She will think you have low self esteem and keep you as a friend that she knows likes her to boost her ego while searching for a guy she is actually interested in. Then she will ghost you once she finds a guy she‚Äôs actually interested in.

datingoverthirty,z84y91,1669753331.0,What's the big deal about commitment if things are going good?,"I'm(34F) super confused about the situation I'm in with 30 M. We've been seeing each other for almost 3 months. Things are going really well. He's introduced me to his friends at Thanksgiving, join in on group calls with his out of state family, and we've gone on actual dates(He's confirmed they are dates). I have stayed the night at his place, but waited a month. I even overheard him call me his girlfriend at said Thanksgiving. 

But he says we aren't dating when I brought up the ""what are we"" conversation. Why? ""Cause he needs a fresh start"". He wants to get a new job and live in a better housing situation. I'm afraid of wasting my time even though things are going well. 

I'm also reeling from the last guy I dated earlier in the year for a month who decided early on I wasn't his person. He liked me enough to keep going on dates, no overnights, but was too scared to say he wasn't interested. 

What is the big deal about commitment? Why do people waste other's time when they know they don't want a future with them? Does it sound like I'm wasting my time or should I give it a chance?",You asked what you were and he said you aren't dating.  If you want to date either tell him you want to date or cut your losses and move on.

I looked him up on fb just now.  His wife is beautiful and the family looks so happy. I asked him many many times if he was single and he always confirmed he was. 

I'm not sure how I missed this or how I allowed it to happen.  

And I'm genuinely disappointed in everything about this situation."
datingoverthirty,z78yox,1669670515.0,Blindsided By Being Dumped,"I have been seeing someone for a little over 3 months. We hadn‚Äôt made it official yet but I really felt it was headed that way. He is from my city originally but left for a while. He moved back about two years ago to take care of his mom who was sick. She ended up passing away but he decided to stay here cause he had a job he really liked. At the beginning of dating he mentioned several times how he would much rather like living somewhere else. I asked him if he thought moving away was in his future and he said no because he liked his job and he has some family here. So I thought it was fine to proceed.

I guess this morning his job told him that they are ending full work from home and that they want him to come into the office 3 days a week and he immediately decided he was going to start looking for a new job in a place he actually wants to live. And then a few hours later I got a text saying he didn‚Äôt want to see me anymore because now that he is quitting his job he doesn‚Äôt have any reason to live here anymore. 


I honestly feel really stupid for developing strong feelings for someone in only 3 months. But I have gone through some personal stuff and haven‚Äôt dated or been intimate with anyone except him in about two years.  I‚Äôm just really upset. I don‚Äôt know how to feel. Should I have seen this coming?","> I honestly feel really stupid for developing strong feelings for someone in only 3 months.

It's okay to feel hurt and rejected, that's only natural.  Don't blame yourself for falling for someone or feeling things.  It's a -good- thing that you developed strong feelings.  It's what you should be doing and encouraging yourself to do.

It's a risk we take when we decide we want love.  That those feelings aren't going to be reciprocated or something is going to happen and we're going to suddenly get hurt.  It happens and it's going to suck every time.  Everyone here has had their heart broken time and time again.  And we keep doing it.  We take breaks now and then to heal from our hurt but you put yourself back out there, willing to go through it all again.

Because eventually it works out.  Eventually you fall for the one who shows you it was all worth it.  It hurts now, sure.  But it won't always.  In a few days or weeks you'll realize that you're still alive.  There are still people out there who love you, are excited to see you.  You'll know that in time you'll be ready to try again.

And maybe the next guy dumps you in a Denny's parking lot at 3 AM.  Or maybe they're your happily ever after and 40 years from now you're making sexy eyes at them in their grandpa pants.  Who knows.  The only way you can find out is by being willing to try again."
datingoverthirty,z75spc,1669663653.0,Be with someone for who they are now vs. pushing each other to be your best self?,"Where is the line or distinction for you between these two mindsets when dating? How do you reconcile accepting someone as they are, but also wanting a partner who helps you grow and become a better version of yourself in whichever ways you deem important?

Obviously there are polarizing topics like physical health and exercise habits, and other areas like mental or financial health that a partner could help with. And of course, the risk of dependency when it comes to being too reliant on a partner helping you vs. helping yourself.

For myself, I always try to view a partner as supportive or complementary to the things you need to work on, but not to the point where you are on opposite extremes (e.g., very extroverted partner taking a very introverted partner to endless social events). In my experience, this tends to cause fundamental rifts that strain and end relationships. Seems like it would be more appropriate in the sense of a partner who is ""better"" at something - such as budgeting - taking the lead in a relationship and supporting/coaching the other person to learn and grow. But then you get into potential issues if one side feels inadequate and resents the other, so both parties have to be willing participants in this sense to truly grow together.

EDIT: The question isn't so much about falling for someone's potential when first starting a relationship, though I do think an important aspect of any LTR is each partner's willingness to grow. It's more so, at what point does ""as is"" conflict with what a person could be for you? When actions and words are disconnected? When effort seems to die out?","I only date people for who they are now.  And I like to date people who inspire me to be the best version of me and who feel the same about me.  That tends to mean dating people with good habits who are hard workers, career focused, health conscious, etc.  This is all subjective, though, and what good habits are depends on your values and priorities.

I have seen friends date people with bad habits and use it as an excuse to slide to the other person‚Äôs level when I think their intention at the outset was to improve/change the other person."
datingoverthirty,z75o85,1669663383.0,How would you want them to respond to ‚ÄúI love you?‚Äù if they don‚Äôt reciprocate (yet)?,"**I want to preface this by saying that I am not looking for advice. I‚Äôm in a weird exclusive situationship with an expiry date, neither of us loves the other. I‚Äôm asking out of curiosity.**

When you catch those helplessly strong feeling with someone you‚Äôve been seeing (for better or for worse), at some point you feel like you‚Äôll explode if you don‚Äôt just tell them ‚ÄúI love you!‚Äù. Of course, in the movies it‚Äôs very black or white: they either feel it too, or they don‚Äôt (or they say they don‚Äôt and then it turns out they do and come running back to grovel). I‚Äôm curious about that pesky middle-ground.

What if they don‚Äôt feel the same way, but they do have feelings for you that they want to keep nurturing? Or they aren‚Äôt 100% sure that what they‚Äôre feeling is love so they don‚Äôt want to say it?

I think about how I‚Äôve often been in situations where a man has feelings for me (not necessarily love) that I don‚Äôt reciprocate, and I find it very difficult to balance out being honest with not being hurtful. It‚Äôs not that I won‚Äôt ever reciprocate the feelings, it‚Äôs just that I‚Äôm not there YET. I can‚Äôt say that though, because it‚Äôs something that they might rely on as a beacon of hope, and will feel like an expectation hanging over me which isn‚Äôt fair on either of us. If I don‚Äôt end up catching feelings then it‚Äôll have made me a liar.

You‚Äôve just admitted to someone that you love them. What would you want them to say if they didn‚Äôt feel it back but they‚Äôre getting there?


[EDIT: thank you to everybody who has contributed their thoughts on the matter. I‚Äôm enjoying reading everybody‚Äôs perspective.]","I understand these words are important to people - and they are to me too. But saying, ‚ÄúI love you,‚Äù shouldn‚Äôt be some kind of surprise revelation I don‚Äôt think. By the time I say it, I would have demonstrated it already in my actions. So they would already have a good idea of how I felt.

The emphasis on who says it first, whether the other person says it back - I think this is a misdirection of sorts. It places too much weight on the words themselves. It‚Äôs like focusing on the wedding instead of the 20 year marriage that follows. The weight should go on the demonstration of love, not just the articulation of the feeling.

As for what they should say back - whatever they wish to, including nothing at all. Me telling someone I love them is a gift, and I don‚Äôt give a gift with the expectation of receiving something in return. It is a promise and an expression of vulnerability, so I would expect them not to make light of it - but if I loved them, this is not likely to happen anyway, because I tend to love kindness."
datingoverthirty,z71oqu,1669654659.0,Social Media Official?,"So, I just had a situation that I know is ridiculous, but it DID get me thinking.  I went on a second date with a woman, she tagged me in a bunch of pics on FB of us ice skating, at the cocktail bar etc...etc...  I'm rarely on social media (I think the last FB post I was actually in was a post my daughter tagged me in in September or August).  She was upset the pics didn't show up on my Timeline, but I do not think I've been on FB for a few weeks.  Me getting tagged has to be approved to show up on my timeline so stuff random stuff like memes or second dates with overly eager women doesn't show up...and I don't check it that often so most stuff just never gets approved.

BUT...is there a time that the ""social media official"" or showing up on timelines even if we aren't habitual users of social media?   I know to me it is not important, but have been told by another woman I dated it felt like I was ""hiding"" her.  She'd met my (rather large) immediate family, was comfortable texting my sisters, been out with my friends and had become friends with a lot of their wives/significant others, but I never bothered posting about her because I just...never post about anything.  Not sure if that is a compatibility issue, or just different habits causing me to not even really think about it issue.  I don't think it should be a shocker to them, I meet most people organically but am sure these women are checking on me on social media before even talking let alone going out and shouldn't be surprised when someone with consecutive ""happy holidays"" posts on their timeline isn't posting about day to day stuff, right?","I think it‚Äôs fine to have different habits around social media. However it should be basic etiquette to ask someone if they‚Äôre okay with being tagged in posts, especially as early on as a second date (which is a bit much in my opinion).

Social media and expectations around that is probably something that should be discussed at some point, especially when at least one person is fairly active on it, but someone tagging you after a second date and then being disappointed that the posts didn‚Äôt show up on your page is not something you should be worrying about. You did nothing wrong."

Personally, I prefer hosting because I‚Äôm lazy and it gives me home court advantage.

datingoverthirty,z6g5kc,1669591505.0,Is wanting a partnership/relationship to be official unreasonable?,"Tldr; I never wanted a wedding and all that jazz but I do want to be legally married. From my experience now men don‚Äôt want it - why?

I‚Äôve just gone over the conversation with one of my closest friends (we were considering to have a relationship and a family, if interested you can check my previous post) and he said there is no way he is getting married. His reasoning is that if someone leaves its expensive, difficult and marriage ruins things - he has a lot of examples of this in his family. There is no difference between him giving me a ring or just saying he loves me etc and signing papers - after all its just papers - his words.

Now, the situation with this guy is clear and we decided against being together for different reasons but that made me think. I want to get married. I dont want a wedding, i dont want to feed anyone in some fancy place and entertain them, i dont have a family so would be happy to take my husbands family to a restaurant, enjoy the food and off we go. 

For me its the effort and intention that matter. Yes, I want to feel like this person really sees his life with me. I dont want to be a forever girlfriend or a housemate that split the bills. Thats all. Is it unreasonable? I spoke to a couple of my male friends and they are against the marriage as well for similar reasons - paper doesnt mean anything. Am I asking for too much?

I dont see myself dating for the foreseeable future but if I ever will - I am just curious - should I just leave it and accept that marriage is not a thing anymore?","Putting aside the hilarious idea that the 3 dudes you know speak for all of mankind, a quick google search indicates that about it's about a 50/50 split between people who choose marriage and who choose to just cohabitate in the under 50 crowd.

Research it would seem indicates that married couples report higher levels of satisfaction and happiness.  Marriage is more than 'just a piece of paper' to a lot of folks out there.  There's really no right or wrong here, so do what makes you happy.

When he‚Äôs home, he doesn‚Äôt get paid from his other job so he‚Äôs working a part time at Amazon.

On our recent date, he talked about how he thinks me and his mom would get along and would like to introduce me sometime soon.

Was hoping to get some thoughts and ideas on where I may be going wrong with my dating life (make 30)

I‚Äôm using a mixture of dating apps and have been meeting some lovely women and have gone a number of dates over the last few months 

Generally speaking ending up going for a coffee to figure out if we have the same ideas about general things ( what we are after) and then if time permits going to a bar down the road 

Lately these dates have been fantastic, great chemistry and easy chat (I drive so I tend to only have one drink or follow it up with non-alcoholic ones), which my date usually follows (ie not drunk)- and definitely a bit of making out and whatnot

I don‚Äôt intend on sleeping with people on the fist date and usually offer to call them a  taxi or give them a ride home (no pressure) and most at this point have suggested we meet again or offer to pay for dinner as I‚Äôve paid for drinks etc on the second date

However after saying goodbye and making sure they got home safe usually within a  day or two I‚Äôll get some form of the following messages (https://imgur.com/a/ixB2Uo2)

The lady above was fantastic and we clearly got on and even agreed to go for dinner next week

And I‚Äôm generally left a bit dumbfounded as to where it‚Äôs all going wrong especially with the above date where I‚Äôm not sure what she means by the messages about going for coffee etc

Any ideas/thoughts?


edit:

will try and respond to all the comments but ive definitely chalked it up to not going anywhere - mainly very confused to me initiating a kiss (only after she had made it clear she was interested (touching my legs, stroking my arm etc, saying you smell great and coming in super close etc) for reference her take after the first kiss was - that was so smoothly done and god your a great kisser

and her initiating the rest of them and her suggesting dinner this week to pay me back for getting the drinks (i have no issue in paying for a few beers/coffee etc)

then her message of home safe - youre awesome and the best kisser ive met to what youve all seen in the messages

Board games and dogs were all things she asked to see herself as i was away with mates this weekend.

in terms of whether i look my photos- yes i hope, generally reaction is ""im so glad the smile wasnt edited etc""

in terms of listening - cant really comment, i believe that most of the discussion was equal, shed ask a question id answer, shes answer and id ask follow up etc

some have asked if im just unattractive etc - im not to all tastes sure but i cant complain? here are the photos from my OLD profiles https://imgur.com/a/EG5HG8e

We clicked when we met, however I expected to never see him again. 

He kept texting, calling and we went out more and more. He brought the kind of energy I need to dating, and showed me time and time again he was going to keep showing up for me. He‚Äôs said I have done the same for him. We both feel lucky. I fell in love some time ago, we now live together.

Tonight we will go to our favorite fancy restaurant to celebrate. He brought me roses earlier today and we finished decorating for Christmas. It‚Äôs been a great day and hopefully a great night. I never thought I could be here again. Happy, in love, and looking towards a real future. It has been an amazing year- for me anyways. I hope (and think) he is just as happy as I am.

- Me: ‚ÄúSounds fun! How about a video call first?‚Äù

Is there a better way to say this? 

I want to convey that I‚Äôm interested, but in person, indoors first dates just aren‚Äôt accessible to me.

Sometimes this devolves into him asking ‚Äúwhy?‚Äù and me explaining that I‚Äôm immunocompromised and don‚Äôt meet in person until after a video date because of Covid risks. It‚Äôs in my profile too but not everybody reads that carefully or asks about it.

Health reasons aside, I know plenty of other people who prefer phone calls or video calls before meeting up with someone from OLD. Just curious how other people are handling this? 

Maybe I‚Äôm making it too complicated by going into the health details that soon - that really works better as a live conversation because there‚Äôs always follow up questions anyway.","As a man, the most important thing to me would be that you express your needs clearly and not hint at or expect me to guess those needs.

datingoverthirty,z3q6gf,1669312124.0,Date number 6 and still no kiss,"My question is mainly for ladies as they can better understand how a woman‚Äôs brain works. 
I have been going out with this girl who‚Äôs in her late 20s for almost 2 months now and we haven‚Äôt even kissed. 
We have been seeing each other at least once a week(sometimes 2) for the last 2 months. She lives alone but I have family members live with me.
She knows that and she doesn‚Äôt seem to mind that when I first mentioned that. 
We have been texting each other everyday. And she‚Äôs the one who usually texts first everyday with a good morning. 
My issue or concern is that we haven‚Äôt even kissed yet let alone be intimate after going out for over 2 months. 
Usually in my previous relationship , by this time I would have been intimate. Or at least the girl would kiss me even after the first date. 
I mentioned in one of our text messages that I wanted to kiss her. And she said ‚Äúyou can‚Äù and I mentioned that I need privacy for that since I am not good making out in public etc‚Ä¶.and she seemed a bit offended thinking I want more than a kiss and I am talking her into having sex.  
At this point our txt has completely shifted into intimacy. I told her that based on my everyone has a desire to be intimate and probably do so after  three dates at most. To which she replied she is shy and isn‚Äôt ready for sex and likes to take things slow. 
We still went out after this ‚Äúargument‚Äù so to speak and yet no kiss. We just hug after a date. 
I feel like she goes out with me just for whatever reason and not necessarily romantically into me.
Should I end this thing ?  Wouldn‚Äôt a woman in her 20s create the environment so a guy she is into at least kiss her ?","The argument was silly. She literally said you can kiss her,  so kiss her.

Folks who do this‚Ä¶ why? 

Are you a touchy person? Is it truly just a break the Touch Barrier so a hug or kiss seems more natural at the end of the date? Is it about physical contact? I‚Äôm truly at a loss, this is not how I communicate with strangers.

Maybe I‚Äôm overthinking it but I genuinely was uncomfortable.","Not doing this risks being seen as not interested.

They have high pressure sales tactics and require you to sign a 1- or 2-year contract at $200/month before you can go to any events. You only have 3 days to get out of the contract, and that is usually before you have had a chance to go to the events. It will cost you $400 to get out of the contract in that 3-day window.

In addition to the membership cost, each event (or adventure) costs $50-$200. They do not filter events by age so there is a chance nobody at an event will be your age. And many events have low turnout.

They also used to illegally record their members, although that probably stopped after  they lost [the class action lawsuit](https://www.lakeshorelaw.org/eventsadventuresclassaction/)."

I (32F) was completely blindsided by my attraction to someone (33M) recently and, while we‚Äôve both acknowledged that we think the other is attractive, it was in a very matter-of-fact way: I saw a really good photo of him and was like ‚Äúwhoa, good face.‚Äù And he returned the compliment.

I know the saying ""you always have time no matter what you do"". What she does is more research type where she comes up with a ""thesis"" and the only person who can do the analysis/writing etc is her. Its not like painting a wall where someone else can take over. I do kind of understand in her specialty since I work with some Tech people who are specialized and people can't just ""take over"" without a high learning curve.

datingoverthirty,z1q198,1669112259.0,Man is excited how to ride it out,Hey! 36f dating 41m we have hit it off and ‚Äúhe hasnt felt this connection since his daughters mom‚Äù and im feeling it as well. Im just so terrified of love bombing or feeling too attached too soon bc ive been in situations before where ive felt stoked and mutual attraction then after we have sex the chase is over‚Ä¶ curious if anyone has any advice for riding this enthusiasm out from lust to attachment.. he‚Äôs emotionally available and we talk for hours and can communicate .. I just want to really get to know one another without a fear of rapid abandonment. Any tips welcome!,"Take it slow, keep the focus on your own life. 

I also had similar fears, have gotten too attached too quickly and had been burned before, and when I met my now bf I was terrified for the first month of dating. Every time I saw him it was amazing which became more and more scary because I was getting attached, and was convinced he probably was hiding something or was just going to check out like the others.

But - I took it slow. We started out once a week or once every other week because of plans we made with other people or travel we had planned. We stayed busy in our own lives. We didn‚Äôt text all day every day. We didn‚Äôt spend whole dates inside, our first 10 dates we went on an actual date every time - we actually didn‚Äôt sleep over for a while. We had sex about a month in - but didn‚Äôt sleep over until almost 2 1/2 months 

Everything moved really slowly, but naturally. When I started getting overwhelmingly scared - overwhelmed with feeling attached and scared of being abused or rejected again, I told him. I told him what I was afraid of, and that I wanted to stay connected to myself, and didn‚Äôt want to lose myself, but I was attached and worried about what type of person he was. We had difficult conversations as soon as they came up.

Turns out we both attach quickly to people, and we‚Äôre scared of the same things. We both purposely held back. We both purposely didn‚Äôt jump into full weekends together, or meeting the friends, or talking every day.

We wanted each other to stay grounded in our own lives. We made plans to keep ourselves busy and just kind of rode the uncertainty for a long time. We both knew it was special, but we maintained a healthy space while dating. We also began pushing each other to live their lives. When he was invited somewhere and we had tentative plans I would say - you go! We‚Äôll hang tomorrow instead. Our dating became less about connecting continually, and more about cheering each other on, and making time for each other around everything else we had going on. 

This was super healthy. Luckily, our lives fit together well, we settled into daily communication because we were excited to tell each other about our days. We are never hurt if the other wants alone time, because we know that space strengthens the relationship. Now we do go full weekends together but that happened when we both felt safe enough to take that step.

There is nothing you can do to get rid of the uncertainty of dating. It will always be scary and uncertain. And it‚Äôs always going to fail until you meet the right person. But you CAN protect yourself. You can make sure that your support system is strong and activated (hang with your friends a lot). You can make sure you are living a life you are proud of (make rock solid plans in your life/hobbies and don‚Äôt break them for him). You can stay connected to yourself, your goals, your vision, and your emotions (journal after every date - how he makes you feel, what you feel like with him. Make time and space for alone time for you). You can hold off on sleeping with him, you can hold off on spending too much time together.

You can have a really strong connection without jumping into feet first into the deep end. 

Think of it like dating in the 1950s. Go out, do things together, have slumber parties with your girlfriends, talk to your family every day. Go to school and take dance classes. Have him take you out on the town for milkshakes and shopping. Have him come to a family function, have your dad grill him - all before having sex or spending full weekends together.

Jokes aside - The right person will respect what you want and need, as long as you communicate your expectations."

I just want to say first that I love this group. I really enjoy and appreciate that so many of you are so candid about your feelings and are willing to be vulnerable in sharing your very personal dating experiences. 

I got out of a bad relationship with a narcissist at the beginning of the year and I really want to ease myself back into the dating world again‚Ä¶the problem is that I feel this block to move forward. I know it‚Äôs fear based, but it is really unnerving that I am this scared to try again. 

I‚Äôve learned a lot from my ex and I know how to be more discerning now with who I date, what I‚Äôm looking for, and red flags to avoid, but I‚Äôm still just so worried that someone will blindside me again.

The best thing you can do is make sure you're not dating with the idea that it all depends on how it ends.  Yes, we all want our happily ever after (whatever shape that may take) and it can be soul crushing/disappointing when things don't end the way we want.  What helps though is making sure that if a relationship ends you don't look back on it as a waste of time.  You should look back on it and sure, be sad that it ended...but up until then it should have been something you enjoyed and at least have learned from.

Or put another way, just because season 8 of Game of Thrones was shit doesn't mean the first few seasons weren't awesome.  I don't regret having watched them.  I wish it had ended differently but I'm not going to refuse to watch any other TV shows just because they might end after a single season."

Hi everyone thanks for the replies.

A lot to take in here but I shall try to summarise.

To clarify I lost my family and have been struggling for the last few years so I don‚Äôt really have any newer photos or ‚Äúnights out‚Äù although I can see the consensus is these would help greatly. Just been surviving coming to terms with it all. 

Photos - they are taken over many years. Seems the swords, choice of t shirts and me putting on weight and starting to bald have been raised, time stops for no man üòÖ but I can agree with the consensus these photos are misleading ( thinking about it they are probably over a 7 year + period) üòÖ

Conclusion- Seems I need a whole new set of photos with different poses, clothes and locations (along with smiling for some of them) and to tidy the beard. Along with writing a meaningful bio that actually explains a little about me and allows for someone to engage with me on those topics?

Basically the profile is quite bad and misleading to anyone that views it and has no deffiniton on me as a person?",You look like a completely different person in each photo! That would make me swipe left because I wouldn‚Äôt know what I was getting!

I don‚Äôt want to get tired of each other‚Ä¶ I know I can bore people quite quickly‚Ä¶ how does one stop doing so? when one gets so excited (like me now), love seems to run out quickly or prove it was only lust.

There's always men trying to take me out on dates/want to go out with me or male friends declaring their live to me; however, I get so sad when I'm not into the.... I try my best but there's some deal breakers that I cannot lower my standards towards.

 Recent dating situations through apps have included men who were functioning alcoholics, occasional weed smokers or drug takers, inactive men who live for the weekend and drink too much, unavailable men, emotionally unstable or with no table manners (licking fingers and worse licking sauce off the table!!!! I know ..), not to mention the narcissists and those who ask me if I wanna go to seggs parties with them.... Pfft..  what's going on? What happened to chivalry.... That's why I'm off the apps and hoping to meet someone in real life but I'm nervous...


I'd been on apps for years and had met my last long term bf through there but have had disastrous dating situations for a long time.. 

Would love to meet an ambitious, active, emotionally intelligent man who likes to take care of himself. I'm only wanting what I have worked towards myself. I'm all those things and would like someone on my level...

Any tips?","One thing to keep in mind: the apps are not a separate reality you can close the door to once you turn them off. The same men you meet in real life are also on the apps 90% of the time. 

So if there are persistent themes of the guys you date acting ick, IMO it might be time to screen a bit more pre-date. If you're meeting guys in a bar or in a shared activity group, think of fun or interesting questions to ask people that get to the answers regarding lifestyle compatibility."

\- First date in 6 months and then being inconsistent.

\- Putting work above everything else.

\- Dating mostly through apps and then barely checking them.

\- ‚ÄúI am a bad texter lol‚Äù

\- Still ignoring obvious red flags in their partners.

\- Not trying to approach a man in real life.

When you make a list, ideally the listed items should be the same parts of speech.  This is called parallel construction.

- Ex:  I‚Äôm looking for a long term partner who relishes her hobbies, displays a witty and creative side, and enjoys cozy nights at home.  In that sentence, the three items in the list are all verbs (relishes, displays, enjoys).  

- Ex:  I‚Äôm looking for a long term partner with diverting hobbies, sparks of wit and creativity, and a penchant for deep conversation.   In that sentence, the three items are all nouns (hobbies, sparks, penchant).

You need to give the reader a map so they know where the sentence is going."

datingoverthirty,yzrf6n,1668906805.0,Profile review - 36F,"Looking for honest opinions on my dating profiles and how I‚Äôm coming across. Please be polite üòÖ 

Thanks in advance for your constructive feedback!

*All profiles have similar ‚Äúhot take‚Äù bios - Tinder has 3 extra photos/videos with more toothy smiles. Bumble has a still full body shot instead of the dancing video. Bumble and Hinge prompts vary.*

Dating men in the 33-45 age range if that makes a difference.

**Links removed - thank you all for your helpful feedback! I encourage everyone to do a profile review, this was eye opening**

Main takeaways I‚Äôm working on:
- Replace dancing full body video with a still full body shot. It looks unnatural in that setting. It may work better as a dancing in the kitchen while cooking video
- Photo variety - less selfies, more candid with other people and full body shots. More toothy smiles. More activity shots like cooking, doing artwork, and hiking vs just walking. I‚Äôm considering tai chi photos/videos too but that may fall into the dreaded *cringy workout photos trope*. Let me know.
- I‚Äôm doing a good job of filtering out lifestyles that aren‚Äôt for me (kids, nightlife, big on dining out and travel, not open to Covid precautions, not health focused). That‚Äôs not for everyone but perfect for me.
- My pun on puns is too subtle. Guess I really *pun*ted it.
- Some ‚Äúhot takes‚Äù could be clearer and may read as vague or dating app cliches
- I swapped out the pro/con prompt to be more light hearted but still say I‚Äôm not a night owl. Here‚Äôs the new one: ‚ÄúCon: I *don‚Äôt* love the nightlife, but‚Ä¶ Pro: I‚Äôve got to boogie, on the disco ‚Äòround, oh yea üéµ‚Äù","37M here, I think your profile does a pretty good job of presenting who you are and what you want.  I wouldn‚Äôt swipe right on you because of certain things you have prominently listed, and I‚Äôm pretty sure that is exactly your intention.

datingoverthirty,yzcnw8,1668866831.0,"Update to ""I just can't get past the first/second date stage"" - Wanted to say thanks!","Hey so originally I made this post two months ago and I thought I could share a little update since some people also commented that I should give a follow-up with more date experiences: [https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/xm20zb/i\_just\_cant\_get\_past\_the\_firstsecond\_date\_stage/](https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/xm20zb/i_just_cant_get_past_the_firstsecond_date_stage/)  
tl;dr of the first post was 33m, never dated before but started OLD a year ago. met multiple matches for first dates but it never went anywhere and I was wondering why.

Now in the original thread multiple people recommended the book ""Models"" by Mark Manson to me which I bought and read. It wasn't an easy read and took me a while to get through because it confronted me with a lot of uncomfortable ideas and habits I have. Most of it made a lot of sense to me though and I made a concerted effort to put it into practice.

The key changes I made to my dating behavior were

* Shifting my general outlook from ""How can I get her to date me?"" to ""Is she the right one for me to date?""
* Being honest and trying to actively express who I am, what I think and what I'm feeling.
* Don't invest in matches that aren't investing in me.
* Polarize and embrace rejection if it happens because in those cases it wasn't going to work out anyway and we just saved each other a lot of time.
* Confidence when it comes to posture, eye contact, personal presentation and clothing (I think I already dressed well before but after thinking about my entire wardrobe more in terms of possible coordinated outfits I bought a few more jackets, pants and shoes in colors that I was missing and I feel good with them).
* Understanding signs of interest and acting on them.
* Giving sincere compliments (This is something I've actually grown to enjoy not only with dates but friends and colleagues too)

I'm sure there was more but that's what comes to mind for now.

With that said I've had A LOT of matches in the last two months (I think because I reset my Bumble profile and Hinge is generally going pretty well). While a lot of conversations fizzled out I've stopped being disappointed about that. Instead I focused on those matches that kept writing back and actually put effort into their texts, which also happened to be way more than before - so I ended up scheduling a couple first dates.

Some of those I decided I'm not interested in, some of them ended it on their terms. During all of them I made an effort to really express myself and show vulnerability though and I noticed that beyond any need for common interests or whatever dates get so much better for me when I'm actually opening up to someone emotionally that knows how to reciprocate.

Among those first dates there was one that seemed like a real connection. We've had a great talk about our families and lifestyles; she also showed real interest in my passions and complimented me for how dedicated I am to them which I appreciated a lot. We've met for a second date the week after and I was actually under a lot of pressure there because she was leaving the country for at least a week, if not longer. I figured if I don't escalate and show my interest things would probably cool off during her absence. In the original thread I think it became clear that I have some anxiety around initiating physical contact and getting intimate so this stressed me out A LOT. Ultimately though I did manage to conquer my nerves (pretty proud of this ngl), asked to hold her hand, we ended up kissing multiple times that night and it was a great date. Good enough that it survived the two weeks she was gone and we resumed after she came back. Date three was great as well and on date four we slept with each other. Date five is already scheduled.

So yeah I'm pretty happy with the results for now. We both expressed looking for LTR but obviously this is early and not secure yet and I'm not going to treat it as such. If you guys have any comments on how to move forward I'll gladly hear them but mostly I wanted to take the opportunity and say thanks for all the advice that was already given. Even if this doesn't work out I feel like I've learned something that I can apply to whatever other potential partners I'll meet in the future.

Thanks DOT!

datingoverthirty,yyyipw,1668816144.0,Has anyone ever had someone pretty much ghost themselves?,"This is a broad question. Has anyone ever started out having steady contact with someone they‚Äôre seeing (day-to-day over a period weeks or months), but like clockwork, over time you notice less initiative or responsiveness from the other person? It literally got to the point that I was the only one initiating at a slower cadence until I just stopped contact altogether. I have other obligations and can‚Äôt always check in or respond instantly. Seems common for people to fall asleep at the wheel and expect the other person to maintain all of the contact and initiative, whether they themselves are still interested or not.

I honestly don‚Äôt like when people disrespect other people‚Äôs time, but expect you to walk on eggshells for theirs. Everybody has a life and other responsibilities. They‚Äôre unresponsive, but assume you‚Äôre not interested if you‚Äôre not blowing up their phone, or they‚Äôre too cool to respond in a timely manner when they had no problem reciprocating previously. All the while, nothing really changed on my end other than ‚Äúreading the room.‚Äù

Has anyone else had similar experiences with contact (either text or phone), and how do you normally handle or interpret disinterest? I‚Äôm wondering how common this form of miscommunication is.","my thoughts are two situations:

1) people hate confrontation and in dating they're not always 100% confident in their decisions. Sometimes people slow fade bc it feels easier than actually saying goodbye.

2) I have had an issue before where people are WAY too effusive in text at the beginning of dating and it's really hard to find a good cadence after that. It might just be the reality that we weren't meant to be. But it makes me almost... wary? Of texting them after that because I'm always afraid it will become a game of 21 questions while I'm trying to work. 

3) I had one guy semi-ghost me like that. He just wouldn't respond to me for like, 3 days at a time (which was hard to feel like was totally ""wrong"" because even at the best of times he was a doctor who didn't look at his phone so sometimes I'd get a text 24 hours later even when things were good). I finally got him on the phone and he admitted he was not in the right place to date, la de da (much later, realized he dated me immediately after a breakup which I hadn't known, and i think he got back with the ex sometime later so that was a factor). IDK why he couldn't just say it, because it would've been kinder, but goes back to point 1 -

I don't think people are *actually* asleep at the wheel, I just think they're the kind of drivers who would make you nervous as a passenger? Time to call an Uber."

datingoverthirty,yxvbvn,1668704294.0,"Getting to know someone ""as friends"" first?","A couple weeks ago I went on a date with someone whom I didn't feel that initial ""spark"" with but who was really nice and also have quite a bit in common with. At this age I'm not about to throw in the towel right away, so I like to give someone at least two days, maybe three.

We had our second date a few days ago and while it was a good time, I still didn't feel that \~romantic\~ interest, even though we did end up kissing. I don't think it's so much his physical appearance but his energy; most men I've dated in the past have been a bit more thoughtful and romantic, at least in the beginning (e.g. asking me deep questions about myself, saying what it is they like about me, wanting to take me to try new things I haven't done before, etc. etc.) This new person has expressed that he is interested in me and wants to see me again, but all those aforementioned examples I'm used to (and enjoy) are lacking. He just seems a tad more juvenile in his approach.

But one thing about OLD that bothers me the most is how much pressure it puts on the supposed ""couple."" In real life (or a perfect world) you typically meet through friends or a hobby, and you see the person here and there in group settings until deciding to hang out one-on-one. **Question being:** How would you feel if someone you meet via OLD asked if they could get to know you at a bit of a slower pace -- as a friend -- and hang out in small group settings first? This new person and I are similar in age and our friend groups are probably two or three degrees of separation from each other, so I know we'd all most likely get along. It would also be interesting to see if we'd still gravitate towards each other when there are other people at hand. I know it's a bit of a strange request, but still. Thoughts?","I don't expect sparks to immediately fly when I first meet someone.  But I do want *something* to indicate that a fire can be built.

datingoverthirty,yxhnq6,1668662902.0,Help with getting the person to come out on the first date,"I‚Äôm a 38M and getting frustrated with texting.  I‚Äôve always been told I‚Äôm a good looking guy (not bragging) so I have no problem getting a girls phone number initially.  But for some reason, I can‚Äôt seem to land a date after.  I text, usually a ‚Äòhello, how‚Äôs it going, you still wanna grab coffee‚Äô, etc. type texts.  Then I‚Äôm always met with a ‚Äúi‚Äôm busy for the next bit, etc.‚Äù  I usually lose interest because if they can‚Äôt fit in a short coffee break with me, it sounds like they‚Äôre not interested, but why give me the number in the first place?

&#x200B;

Am I moving too fast with the invite?  What exactly do women want when they give me their number?  Are they expecting a long drawn out text exchange?  I find it very difficult to find topics to ‚Äúchat‚Äù about with, who is essentially, a complete stranger.  And isn‚Äôt that the point of having coffee? To get to know each other?

&#x200B;

My successful dating has always been with women that I work with, or went to school with, women that I know. But when it comes to strangers that I approach, my success rate is very low.  And honestly, I do not approach a girl that is showing zero interest, it‚Äôs always someone who makes it pretty clear that they‚Äôre interested in me in some way. I‚Äôm just unable to take it to the next step.  Any insights?

&#x200B;

EDIT: I'm meeting these people in real life, I don't do online dating, too awkward for me.

I think I'm just old fashioned, I want to talk to a person, not my phone.  I know there's another person on the other side of the phone but.. it feels not right to me..  But I guess I need to evolve and get better at working with the technology.  

&#x200B;

For context, I'm not asking for a number on sight. I initiate convo and if it goes good, I ask for further contact, phone, social media, whatever feels right. I never get the vibe that the girl is threatened, but maybe they are?  I'll keep that in mind. 

What I'm hearing a lot though is that I need to put in some more effort, that's fair, I'll try that.  Thanks for the comments so far everyone, a lot of helpful insights!

&#x200B;","People don't expect drawn out text exchanges, however, people are usually sussing you out with a bit of back and forth. If you can't find some sort of common ground, then what's the point of going on a date? If you feel like you can't communicate over text, offer a phone call.

Granted some people are just timewasters. Learn to spot them early and move on. If they don't accept your date proposal after one or two offers, or rearrange, either leave the ball in their court or block.

datingoverthirty,yx0o97,1668621128.0,"Best Friends, Threesomes, Disclosure - Oh my!","Back in January 2020, I (33F) was tired of dead end dating- casual sex, unavailable men, situationships- and decided I wanted to get serious about finding a relationship. I vowed that I had to have a real emotional connection with the next person I had sex with. And then -boom- the pandemic happened and killed my dating life entirely. 

During this global shit show, I got closer to a couple of friends. They were in an open relationship and I had briefly dated the guy, ‚ÄúJames‚Äù, for a month before deciding that ENM wasn‚Äôt going to work for me and we‚Äôd be better as friends. I got to know his girlfriend, ‚ÄúDanielle‚Äù and we got along well. I attempted to date a little but the collective uncertainty, burnout, and lethargy killed any potential. 

Eventually the three of us had formed a ‚Äòpod‚Äô and were hanging out a ton, making dinner together, watching movies, celebrating holidays, and going on little overnight trips to cure our cabin fever. I had other friends I saw when I could but socializing was limited and it was a tough time for extroverts, so we all leaned into the pod. 

We went on an overnight trip where we got tipsy and more cuddly than usual. They asked if I would be interested in a threesome and I was conflicted so I thought about it overnight. I realized that I *did* have a deep emotional connection with these people, and the trust and security I wanted was there even if the situation was nontraditional, so I decided to go for it. It was a really positive experience for us all, and we hooked up a couple more times over the next month. We were horny and cooped up and very comfortable with each other, and one thing led to another. I think they were interested in spicing up their sex life and all of us were interested in me getting some action because it had been ages. I generally don‚Äôt blur the lines between my platonic friendships and sexual relationships so the whole thing was surprising to me. I was also very surprised by my sexual attraction to Danielle, as I hadn‚Äôt considered myself bi. My fears that it would create jealousy or ruin the friendship didn‚Äôt happen.

A couple months later I met someone through Danielle who I was interested in, so the threesomes stopped and we went back to just being friends. The new guy fizzled out after a couple months. Things with my friends didn‚Äôt get sexual for a long time after that but eventually we hooked up a few more times over six months. They have since broken up so it‚Äôs over, but I am still best friends with them individually and they are a big part of my life. 

None of our mutual friends know about the threesomes and I don‚Äôt want them to. I think it‚Äôs a tricky thing to wrap your head around a friendship that is 95% platonic but infrequently became sexual, and I don‚Äôt want it to diminish the rich friendship we have. Plus a lot of my friends are kinda vanilla and might be judgey. I never had a sexual relationship with either one individually, it was always as the three of us or not at all. Also fwiw me and James never had PIV sex. There is no chance that I‚Äôd date or hook up with either of them now. But I do spend a lot of time with them individually and we share a wide social circle. 

I‚Äôm seeing someone I‚Äôm really excited about and curious what I should disclose to any potential long term relationship partners. They are still my close friends, there‚Äôs no temptation to rekindle anything, and they have respected my boundaries. But the general consensus on a recent BORU post* is that you should disclose if you ever had a prior sexual relationship with a current friend. I honestly am conflicted because I don‚Äôt want petty jealousy to get in the way of my relationships, no one is going to be inappropriate, and it was a secret I was planning to take to my grave. I don‚Äôt think this will interfere with future relationships, but I can see the argument for transparency. DOT Redditors, how would you handle this situation?

TLDR: I had a discreet threesome a few times with two of my best friends. What must I disclose to future long term partners?

Edited: *the post: https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/yv8ohl/oop_i_have_slept_with_both_of_my_best_friends_and/

Additional details: The relationship was never romantic, I was not dating them, we were not in a throuple. It was literally friends with benefits, and the friendship was and is the priority.


Edit #2: Thank you all for weighing in, it‚Äôs interesting to see how divided opinions are on this topic. 

It seems like there are a couple issues being conflated in the comments- those who find threesomes to be a dealbreaker in and of itself, and those who find being friends with a prior sexual partner to be a dealbreaker. And then those who find people who aren‚Äôt accepting of threesomes/sexual history/prior sexual partners as friends to be its own dealbreaker. Many of you correctly pointed out that I‚Äôm probably not compatible with folks in the first two categories. 

I would also like to make it clear that being sexually open-minded doesn‚Äôt mean I am more susceptible to cheat or lie or have loose morals. Sexuality is not morality. Having a threesome doesn‚Äôt make me a bad person or doom future relationships. Sex has not poisoned my friendships. It‚Äôs fine if it‚Äôs not your cup of tea, but I don‚Äôt need your judgment.

Some folks were asking what I‚Äôd think if the situation was reversed. It wouldn‚Äôt bother me if my partner was good friends with someone he had previously slept with if it‚Äôs definitely over, they can handle themselves, and he‚Äôs shown himself to be trustworthy. I think healthy relationships are built on trust and not monitoring. And if appropriate disclosure builds trust, then I‚Äôm more likely to do it. My primary concern is to do right by this guy *and* my friends.","This is a sword of Damocles.  I've seen some already recommend you don't say it because too many people will not out.  But the problem is that the few who might not run immediately, will likely leave if this comes out after months or years.

I think that you'll need to say something about this before anyone you date meets these friends.  And honestly, a lot of people will be scared off, so you might want to bring it up sooner than later.  You'll ruin a huge time investment (along with the time of the other person) if you hope it doesn't come out.

Three can keep a secret, but only if two are dead.  Unless you're planning a killing spree, do not think that you can keep this secret."

I need to find someone who is very chill or ADHD too. I‚Äôm tired of explaining that you couldn‚Äôt get mad at a deaf person for not hearing you and if I am trying, you can‚Äôt get mad at m for things I can‚Äôt control and change. So I think I need to shop around A LOT.

But the people I go on dates with seem to want to ‚Äúlock me down‚Äù and come one strong etc etc. sometimes they seem fine and I wouldn‚Äôt mind being exclusive, but then it just eventually ends when they are driven mad by my ADHD and I‚Äôm tired of being emotionally abused all the time, so I end it.


TL;DR- how do I navigate a dating scene where I appear to be a catch but actually I need someone specifically tolerant of my ADHD? I need tips on how to shop around despite my inclinations to commit.",">I have awful ADHD and I annoy the bejesus out of anyone who is in a proper LTR with me (think keys left in the front door, losing things all the time, forgetfulness, lateness)

Are you upfront about your ADHD? I wouldn't wait to have this conversation and bring it up early. I'd specifically ask your dates if forgetfulness and lateness are pet peeves of theirs or will trigger them. I'd even go into some examples of how forgetful and how late, so that people know what they're getting into. This will help people understand what a relationship with you will look like. You can also ask them what they are on a scale of type A to very easygoing. Type A people will probably be much more annoyed. Or if they have any experience with being around people with ADHD."

datingoverthirty,ywdydd,1668557086.0,My years-long dry spell ended last weekend. Here are my thoughts.,"So... I had an amazing first date last weekend that ended with us sleeping together. It was great! Honestly one of the best nights of my life. I've felt lonely for a long time, and I've gotten in a lot of arguments with people online over what I'm doing wrong with dating, and the truth is, most of what frustrated me about dating still holds true.

I'm one of those people who's constantly told by dates that they ""don't feel a connection"" or just see me as a friend. It always frustrated me, because I always believed you can't feel a true ""spark"" with someone until you know and trust them. While the sparks definitely flew this date, it took a lot of time. Fortunately, we both had clear schedules, and weren't trying to ""squeeze in"" time for a date while we did other things. I met her on Bumble, and while online dates can turn out awful some times, at the very least we had a good start. Both of us were quick to respond to each other's messages, planning was easy, and nobody flaked last minute.

Because we set aside so much time for each other, it gave us plenty of time to get to know each other. We walked around, talking about our values, our interests, our experiences. We probably spent a good hour and a half together just getting to know each other. I can't think of how many coffee dates I've had where we chatted for an hour, then never heard from her again. But at the start, that's all this date was - just talking.

But after walking, taking a break to get a coffee, and walking some more, I decided to be more bold. Now, I'm used to rejection (obviously). There have been times where I tried to be more affectionate with a woman, only to be shot down. Sometimes I was rejected after getting what I thought were very clear signs that she was interested in me. As a result, I stopped looking for signs altogether. She had given me zero signs of flirting at this point.

I asked permission if I could put my arm around her as we walked. Now, she was SHOCKED. She actually thought that I wasn't that interested in her, but she decided it was okay. We talked a bit more about our dating experiences, and I told her I can be a bit distant at first because of my past heartbreaks. A little while later, I told her I wanted to kiss her. Again, she was shocked, and hesitated for a moment, but decided that she was okay with kissing.

At this point, the whole dynamic changed. We were past the ""getting to know each other"" phase, and soon we weren't just hanging out, it was about getting back to where she was staying so we could be alone. Thankfully for us, the fact that I hadn't had sex in years turned out not to be a problem.

The main takeaways I have is that 1. we were both good communicators, and 2. we were willing to be vulnerable with each other. She hadn't given me any signs that she was sexually attracted to me, nor me with her. When I showed affection, I made sure to respect her boundaries, but she was comfortable enough to reciprocate my advances. We talked about why we behaved the way we did, and were open about our insecurities.

Most importantly, it took effort on BOTH our ends. We made time for each other, we didn't expect each other to read the other's mind, and we didn't play games. We opened up to each other bit by bit, gaining trust, until we reached a point where we were fully open with each other.

Do I have a girlfriend now? Well, it's hard to say, considering she isn't actually a resident here. But regardless, it's nice to feel that passion for once, and I hope others here will take what I've learned to heart.","With my current guy I messaged first on Hinge. Literally said ‚ÄòI like x,y,z about your profile- interested?‚Äô. He set up the video call. After the video call he set up the first date. 

On the first date I made the move of linking my arm in his when walking. I felt comfortable and wanted him to know. He asked me if I wanted to continue our date, I said yes. After feeling I was comfortable he went in for a first kiss. At the end of our date I said I felt good about him and said I wanted to see him again. Now when I want to see him I tell him ‚ÄòI‚Äôd like to see you‚Äô. He always asks how my schedule looks for the week. 

Straight up and honest. Working out great so far.

datingoverthirty,yw5r8w,1668537470.0,Is it too late to send an explanation?,"Do I message an explanation after weeks? I feel like I ghosted someone and feel bad for it. I want to go forward and be more honest and open in my relationships.

Okay. So I dated a guy 4 times. He originally said he was out of an ltr and wasn't looking for something serious.

I was also out of ltr and just exploring tinder/dating. I knew in future I want to be married but I was open to casual dating at the time. To be honest, I wanted to feel desired again as my ex stopped the physical affection a long time before I left. This guy was nice, I'd met him in person once and he seemed cool. He was the first on the app who I was attracted to who also seems a good guy who made the effort to ask me out.

So we went out twice. Got on okay. I though he is a really cool guy. I felt chemistry. He messaged regularly and it was nice to have someone to chat to. We had 2 more dates that ended in okay sex. It wasn't amazing. Part of the reason was I started thinking, that I shouldn't be doing it because I knew he wasn't after ""something serious"" and I felt I want more. I knew that I needed to stop engaging with him so that I can be available for someone who actually wants a real romantic relationship with me.

So a few days after our last date, I messaged to say thank you for the date. He replied and we back and forth messaged some small talk. He was the last to message and I never replied. He never messaged again.

It's been several weeks. I saw him out a week ago and he acknowledged me when walking past but just said hi, looked kinda cold, like he wasn't happy with me, then walked past. 

I'm wondering do I message him now to tell him why I stopped talking to him? We have mutual acquaintances.  I feel bad for not telling him at the time, I just didn't know what to say and I didn't want to embarrass myself and appear too emotional when I knew he just wanted casual.

I just feel bad that I spent time taking and connecting with this guy. I respect him and I know he has feelings even if he wanted casual. I wanted to show him the respect of an explanation of why things ended from my point of view.

Is it too late to say something and what do I say?","Honestly, this sounds more about you than him.  You feel guilty about  possibly ghosting (which, I don't think you did, necessarily.  If cared enough, I'd imagine that he would have shot over another text) and want him to ease that guilt.

Just move on and in the future, if you don't want to feel you might have ghosted someone, tell them you're not interested."

Unfortunately in two months I've gotten a total of six messages from tinder four of which were just what seemed to be a username with no indication of what site they were supposed to be for followed by a message that said ""Add me"". Naturally I assumed that's just the latest dating app scam because that's shady as hell. The other messages were a woman beginning me for money and lastly I got three replies from another woman none of which contained more than four words before being ghosted. This is all from tinder.

As far as my bumble account well, I just don't understand bumble at all. Apparently I can't message first, it has to be the woman who sends the first message, ok great, I like that idea.

I wanted to take things slow, and we did and he was fine with that. He‚Äôs divorced and wasn‚Äôt jumping in super quickly. I am just gun shy with things. In any event, things picked up and got seriously and we were exclusive. Then he started backing off a bit and I asked him what was going on and he didn‚Äôt think anything. We then had a long conversation last month that basically was him saying he can‚Äôt handle going quickly/isn‚Äôt sure he can give me what I need but he wants to continue talking. We have since talked a little and seen each other once. It was excruciating because I like him so much and he likes me but he won‚Äôt give in to his emotions. We both miss each other and this has been brutal. Should I back off and continue to hangout and see where it goes or do I cut my losses and leave for good?  

TLDR : do I wait around for the guy to figure things out or walk away.","Don't ever wait around for someone if you can help it. Date other people and give him the space he asked for. Maybe he does just need time to process and will come back but they often don't. I would recommend cutting contact but explaining to him that what he's giving just doesn't work for you. Acknowledge your feelings, own them and let him know that's why you can't just keep talking
 I do think leaving things on a nicer note where you asserted your needs without attacking him will increase that chances that if the timing is right and you bump into each other again the door might still be open.

Funny thing is, every time I would start making out with her, she‚Äôd have a conversation starting after a few seconds. Normally when I‚Äôm with someone once we start making out, convo dies out and it starts getting hot and heavy allowing me to escalate further.

Now I‚Äôm thinking I fucked this up by not progressing it further but normally I can read the room and tell when I‚Äôm turning someone on while making out and I just could not get a good read on this one.

Do I just chalk this one as an L and move on? Any advice?",Maybe she thought she was ready (why she went up to your place). But she could‚Äôve realized in the moment with you that she wasn‚Äôt ready after all (why she kept talking and wouldn‚Äôt let things advance).

And yes I am gonna step back, maybe I will ask him on the 3rd date though what he thinks about us. Might as well be direct and if he sees this for something romantic or casual. I initially appreciated how slow he's taking it, being gentle and all, but this is also confusing me, and I'm not sure he'd see it that way or not. The only way to make this clear is probably me telling him... The thing is at this point it doesn't make my day or makes my day whatever his answer is.

I have to say, I think the flight thing is a relatively white lie (and I'm someone with a hard stance against things like lying about age, etc). It was basically an excuse to not be in touch, at a point where he doesn't really \*need\* an excuse to not be in touch. Depending on how you know what flights are going through that airport, I might actually be more weirded out by you monitoring him to that level than I am by him making what he probably thought was an innocuous excuse for not being in touch.

datingoverthirty,yujz8e,1668386247.0,Dating app messaging frequency?,"I really struggle with dating app messaging frequency.  How do you balance having a life and responding to messages in a timely manner?  
I don't like to message while I am at work and then by the time I get home and make dinner and do a few chores, that really only leaves 2-3 hours max available for chatting.  And honestly it's a little annoying trying to read a book/watch a movie/enjoy a hobby and having to pause every few minutes to respond to messages.  So I end up in this endless cycle of good initial conversation and then taking time off the app to work/live life/whatever and then message back.  I'm sure the men take this as me playing games, but that is never my intention.

So my question is what is a reasonable amount of time to take to respond?  Do you treat the apps as if it's text messaging and respond immediately/as soon as you can?  Do you set up dedicated blocks of times to respond?

I know I am turning off guys by my messaging schedule and I know I need to improve there.  I'm just trying to find the balance that works for me.","I don't treat messaging on an app like texting, because I'd rather not use a dating app as a replacement for getting to know someone.

In general I try to not put too much information that might be a turn off for someone as far as relationship goals, whether I want kids or not, etc.  My thought is those things are better to sort out after meeting if we hit it off.  My general dating goals are to just meet people and see where it goes.  I do want a more serious relationship, I do eventually want kids, but am not opposed to a shorter term dating if I really hit it off with someone.


The info you cant see is ""Don't have children"" ""drinking: sometimes"" ""Smoking: no""

Photo caption on me splitting the log is ""Who needs a gym membership when you have logs?!""

Photo caption on me at the fire is ""Love hanging with friends around a fire.""

Photo caption on me singing is ""Always down for some karaoke.  What are your go to songs?""","I imagine you're in a more rural place so ""city rules"" might not apply here lol but I typically would advise to be upfront about your longterm goals. 

I understand the logic behind it but a lot of women will swipe left on profiles that seem casual without bothering to ask you about it because it often indicates a guy who wants to keep things hazy and undefined bc he wants casual but he also wants a maximum # of matches. 
 People will be suspicious of intent especially when it's Hinge and you almost have to go out of your way not to indicate the relationship type you're looking for.

And if my experience resonates with others, why then are people so callous when things do seem promising (for eg. just got ghosted after a second date that ended up at my place). 

I'd love to hear about people's experiences!","I think it depends on a lot of factors like age, preference, and perception.

Age: I had more choices I liked when I was in my late 20s/start of 30s. Now I just have... a lot of choices, it feels like. And this is just the difference of 2-3 years. I also see more of the same people pop up than I used to (smaller pool), though I think being in a huge metro region = you won't be as impacted by the winnowing of the pool.

Preference: If you have a more wide preference of people you connect with, you don't tend to get the ""I don't feel it with anyone!"" fatigue that makes people want to check out of the apps and commit. 

Perception: a lot of people saying others don't take it seriously b/c they're spoiled for choice aren't actually experiencing it, they're just projecting. My mom has implied that this is happening to me before, but I wouldn't agree. Even if I was just matching and meeting with one of these people, at this point in my life I don't have an interest in trying to romance someone I don't feel romance with.

I think part of the issue is simply AGING, because it's something we all experience only once so the experience of shifting dating habits feels novel. I think in my 20s my odds of dating a match were way higher but I was going off of just vibes alone. If someone basically showed me attention and was nice it was off to the races. Now it's, you know, nice if people are interested, but it's also essential that they're typically employed and don't want to live on a commune one day, don't stay up until 4am while I go to bed at 11pm, etc. there's just less room to fuck around and waste time as you age. People are more willing to stay single and wait for the right-right match.

When it comes to callousness, people just suck and I think as a society we've been shaped weirdly by social media. Like people just have so much information and clicky things to do each day that they can ignore you and instead of feeling guilty about it they just watch Tiktok for 3 hours and allow their brain to melt. Actually I have no idea if this is true, but it's a fun theory I decided to throw into the mix today."
datingoverthirty,ytew67,1668278197.0,34M Bumble Profile Review,"Update: Thanks everyone for the feedback! I've removed the links.

Hi everybody! Looking to put myself back out there & I would like to optimize my Bumble profile. Here's a link to the profile before I deleted it.

Basically, I discovered Bumble last summer. I wasn't even finished my profile before I was receiving matches (lots of comments on my turtle & baking) & I haven't made changes since (I still had one more prompt & image to add). Despite that, I was able to land dates.

Here's a link to new photos I've taken in the past few months as well as a rewritten bio & prompts (I'm terrible at writing). I'm hoping to add a photo of me doing an activity I like later today.

Looking for feedback on what images should stay or go as well as thoughts on my biography/prompts & what I should add.

BTW, if any of you dated me, don't judge me!

Thanks!

The consensus so far:

* Dog pic has to go
* Cut/Change my hairstyle
* Nix the part about 'weight gain'",I hate to say it but cutting your hair would take you to a new level.
datingoverthirty,ytdywb,1668275853.0,"Dating a Widow/er, what has been your experience?","At our age, widow/ers are very uncommon but here we are. I‚Äôm talking to this girl who seems really cool but on her very profile she mentions she‚Äôs a widow (in a funny way, mind you, but still).

I‚Äôm worried that a) her bringing up her deceased husband in her profile means she‚Äôs still not done healing or b) dating a widow will mean a competition against a ghost forever.

Thoughts? Experiences?","I‚Äôve not dated a widow, but I‚Äôve dated a woman who had a boyfriend of five years pass away. The only thing that I‚Äôd advise you on is that her deceased partner will always hold a special place in her heart no matter how many years pass. There will be days that will always be hard for her - old anniversaries, the day he passed, etc. There will almost certainly be people in her life that she will be close to that are from the relationship, his parents, siblings, friends, etc. and she will want to stay part of their lives.

None of this means she hasn‚Äôt moved on although it might be tempting to see that way. It just means she‚Äôs human. If you already think you‚Äôre in a competition with a man who is no longer living, she probably isn‚Äôt for you."

Much appreciated.:) Opinions are kind of divided. I think I will go meet him without any expectations since I don't have a lot going on right now, and also the exhibition looks interesting/is on the way to my work place. :) 
If something happens between us then great! If not then that's also alright.","I had a similar situation. The guy who cropped back up happened to message as I was returning from a disastrous date. He claimed he'd been sick and his mom was out from whereever visiting so he had no time to text me. 

I gave him a chance. We dated for 2 months, but I always felt like I was putting more effort in than he was (like he claimed to be an amazing cook, but never cooked for me once). When he went on vacation and couldn't make time to see me in the week beforehand I felt uneasy. After he was back for a few days before a business trip and was only willing to squeeze me in for a workday lunch (he had plans with friends) I ended it. 

For me it was a lesson in not being someone's afterthought or Plan B. Disappearing for 3 weeks and deciding to come back is telling of how they will treat you in the future."

So I don't know why I always bristle at it - and it's not in an 'I'm jealous' way, it's more like...I feel like it's a weird flex and a bit tone deaf? But maybe not!

datingoverthirty,yso384,1668203020.0,How important is a prospects achievements to you?,"Weird question I know.

Recently started seeing a woman who‚Äôs a bit younger, but she seems to wear expensive clothing, and though she doesn‚Äôt act like it gives me some sort of wants all the best stuff, class symbol sort of vibes. Previous ex was very wealthy.

It‚Äôs made me feel a little insecure being im 30, living in a tiny studio in a city that‚Äôs not the nicest. I have a stable job that pays well (top 90% for my age), great benefits and my main focus has been travel and enjoying life. Im content in where I am and have recently buckled down on finances/retirement savings and my fitness.

I‚Äôm just wondering, when dating, how closely do you look at these things? Materialistic things like what a person owns or their career drive/want for more in their life.","I want someone who‚Äôs similar to me in terms of wealth, and more importantly, how they spend money.

datingoverthirty,ysqbx2,1668208676.0,Is he toxic / manipulating me? I genuinely don't know what to do or think?,"Here's a TLDR of what happened

Met an amazing guy, dated for a few months, he accused me of cheating (which I never did or would do) and immediately blocked me on everything and didn't want to talk to me. I saw him in public and confronted him about the whole situation, we made up but he still wanted to be single. Despite wanting to stay single he still texted me here and there. He went back home a week after all of that went down (he lives across the country) and when he got back he video called me and sent me good morning good night messages for a few days. He's been very hot and cold with communicating with me.

Before he broke up with me he blew me off a lot when I tried making plans with him. I asked multiple times to go out to eat, which he agreed to, to only then blow me off to go eat with his friends. This hurt me incredibly. He also stopped texting me and seeing me in person, and when I confronted him about it he thought I needed space which I don't get because I kept asking to go out with him.

In essence, everyone is telling me I'm better off. I'm still giving him my affections and bought him gifts before he left which no one thought he deserved. In return I'm not getting much affection or communication back, and I feel like I'm desperate. It feels like he's treating me like we're still together even though he wanted to remain single. Me and him had a lot of great times together and he treated me very well up until he didn't. What do I do at this point?",Move on and forget about him.
datingoverthirty,ysqfkt,1668208947.0,Has casual dating turned into a successful relationship for anyone?,"I (35f) have been talking to a match (36m) for a few weeks and during that time we established if we hit it off it would be good for it to be a casual situation. He was in a 15 year relationship and has only been single for a few months so it‚Äôs not something either of us feel comfortable committing to. I truly feel like people need some time and a bit of dating around after a relationship that long before committing to another LTR. 

Our connection and chemistry is off the charts and we‚Äôre both feeling that whole ‚Äúright person, wrong time‚Äù thing. 

We went on our first date a few days ago and it was the best date I‚Äôve been on in the 2 years of dating. Nothing sexual, he was very respectful of my boundaries. He is the first person to call me when he got home from the date to say goodnight and has since been consistent in his communications. 

I don‚Äôt mind casual. I haven‚Äôt done it before although I‚Äôve been open to it for some time. We discussed what casual meant for us which is keeping our dating apps active and not feeling afraid to engage with potential matches that seem worth it. I‚Äôm trying to find a LTR or life partner so I don‚Äôt want to limit myself. I also want him to get some dating experience and figure out himself. Is this a bad idea for us to casually date knowing we both are feeling that spark. Or does casual dating usually progress to anything serious after a certain amount of time?

datingoverthirty,yrxw5q,1668130865.0,How to Respond to Second Date Invite on the First Date?,"So I‚Äôve noticed that on the last ten or so first dates I‚Äôve been on where the guy was interested, the men have all asked me for a second date in person at the end of the first date.

It makes me really uncomfortable to be put on the spot like that, so I just agree to it, even if I‚Äôm not interested in meeting again.  I don‚Äôt want to tell someone to their face that although we just had a lovely conversation I‚Äôm not romantically interested in them.  It feels . . . cruel?  Whereas if the man texted later that night or the next day, I‚Äôd be able to politely send a ‚Äúno spark‚Äù text.  Most of the times, I‚Äôm just not physically attracted to the date and know that when I walk in. Sometimes, I barely recognize them from their photos. But I‚Äôm a pretty friendly, socialable person and so if I‚Äôm going out, I‚Äôm going to make it enjoyable for both of us. Men often read having a nice conversation as romantic interest, even when I‚Äôm not actively flirting. 

I then leave the date feeling crappy, and either end up going on a second date I‚Äôm not excited about or letting the guy down by text afterward when he initiates plans for a second date. I‚Äôm sure that a lot of the men find this confusing/bewildering behavior on my part and post here complaining about the girl who said yes to a second date but then changed her mind.  (And I‚Äôve been that girl. The one who was like, ‚ÄúHe went out of his way to suggest a second date on the first, but now is showing no interest in meeting up again. Why did he do that?  Dating is the worst!‚Äù  I don‚Äôt want to do that to others, but I also don‚Äôt want to be put in an awkward situation of an in-person rejection for someone I‚Äôve known for an hour or two.)

How do others approach this?  Any advice for delivering a just not interested message in person?  Or texting afterwards to change your mind?

Also, I‚Äôd highly recommend guys wait to plan a second date by text or phone instead of putting someone on the spot.  Though I know that suggestion will be controversial on this sub.  This used to rarely happen ‚Äî men would almost always ask for a second date by text a few years ago ‚Äî but there must be some advice going around to lock in a second date before the end of the first these days.

Edit:  Thanks already for the helpful suggestions. Most of the times, they aren‚Äôt trying to lock in a specific day/time, but rather a commitment to see then again. And it‚Äôs also not just them saying that they want to see me again (which doesn‚Äôt really bother me, and I don‚Äôt respond to . . . I deflect and say something like ‚ÄúI had a nice time.‚Äù). What makes me feel uncomfortable is when someone says, ‚ÄúWould you like to go out again?‚Äù as a direct question where I feel like I need to answer.","As a guy and If the dates gone well, I like to say I'd like to see you again so it's made my intentions clear that I'm into them.

Do you have specific timing or things you want to see from a person to feel like you want to continue dating and see where it goes?

I was in a relationship for almost two years that ended because we realized we had very different views on if and when we wanted to have kids. I'm 33F, and I want to have kids as soon as I have a partner I trust who is also ready. I feel like I have my money and housing and job situations in a row. 

I've been dating for maybe 8 months now, and not wanting kids, or wanting to wait 5+ years are a hard no for me. 

I've been seeing a man for about a month and he's the first person I've been seriously interested in since my last break up. I broached the question of kids last weekend, and the response I got was kind of in a grey area for me - he wants kids, but wants to focus on work first. He (28M, 5 years younger than me) definitely wants to have kids, but feels like he needs to focus on improving his career and financial situation to provide for a family. He seems to be working pretty actively on this - he is working full time, taking government sponsored language classes, and is often applying for jobs and seeing an employment counselor.  He also came to the country 6 years ago as a student refugee from a war-town country, so definitely starting at a disadvantage in this respect. 

I'd like to date him and get to know him more and see how this plays out, but I'm trying to figure out my own boundaries and comfort level of how long I would wait to see if we were on the same page. I suppose I want to know a more specific timeline that he is imagining, what specifically he wants in terms of job security and money before his priorities shift to having kids...and I'm thinking about how long am I willing to wait to see if we move closer to being on the same page about timing if they turn out to be kind of different. It's tricky because his job situation could change very quickly or very slowly, so how long to I wait to find out?

datingoverthirty,ypuqf3,1667932852.0,Looking for advice on how to move forth with this situationship?," 

I (30F) was dating a guy (30M) for the last 2.5 months. We met on Hinge at the end of August and hit it off right away. I've dated several guys throughout the summer and this is the first one with whom non-stop conversation just flowed.

Right off the bat though, it became apparent that he had just ended a 4.5 year relationship with a woman he was engaged to. They broke off the engagement and he was in the process of selling the house they owned together. After the 3rd date (which is when we had sex) I realized that I was starting to really like him and asked him what he was looking for. His answer - ""I'm open to whatever right now, I'm definitely not opposed to a serious relationship but I don't think I'd wanna rush into one quickly"". Not a great answer but I wasn't too bothered by it. I want a serious relationship myself but I personally like to take the time to make sure that person will be the right person. To me that means going exclusive sooner than later but I personally like to hold off on making things ""official"" and putting them all over social media, I take time to introduce family, etc. Personal choice.

I continued to date him and although my intent was to be cautious, we ended up talking every day, seeing each other 1-2 times a week depending on work schedules, sleeping over at each other's places some weekends. 2 months in, I reach the point where I really have feelings for the guy. I also start feeling anxiety over the fact that he still has his dating apps and is active on them. I decide to bring up the topic of exclusivity. He said he wasn't sure, he said he has avoided thinking about whether he saw our situation developing into something more serious down the road. He wanted a week to think about it.

We met for coffee yesterday and talked for about an hour. He opened up to me quite a bit during this conversation. Some takeaways:

* He feels should have probably taken more time to process the end of his last relationship but jumped on the apps impulsively
* His ultimate goal is to eventually be in a serious relationship again, but he doesn't feel ready to commit to one right now and he doesn't know how long it will take for him to be ready. He said ""I wouldn't want you to feel like I wasted your time if in 2-3 months I still don't feel ready"".
* When it came to his last relationship, he felt like he neglected his needs and mental health by constantly putting the needs and wishes of his partner first which ultimately made him feel suffocated.
* He's going to therapy regularly now, he recently started taking antidepressants again, and he's trying to focus on his mental health which is another reason he is hesitant to commit to a serious relationship, because he doesn't want to fall back into his ""people pleasing"" tendencies before working through that issue.
* When asked if he saw our situation progressing into something more he said like he couldn't tell because he doesn't feel ready for a relationship so it's hard for him to picture one but also obviously he felt something there.
* He hasn't been on a date with someone else in almost a month (which means the past couple weeks has been me getting paranoid without any basis)
* Lastly, he would have a hard time dealing with a ""now-or-never"" ultimatum. He likes me a lot and wants to keep seeing me so it's easy for him to give in and say ""screw it, let's just be exclusive"" but based on what he's learning in therapy it wouldn't be good for him as that would be him once again not fully considering his needs first. He feels torn because the other option is ""never"" and that would be a hard choice because he doesn't want that either.

At the end I decided that it's best to stop seeing each other and talking daily, for now. I offered to reconnect in December and maybe go grab a drink or coffee. I don't know what to do here. It does sound like he really needs to process the baggage of the last relationship. I'm also not sure if he's had the same kind of feelings for me as I've had for him. I feel like this guy is on the same wavelength as me, personality wise, value-wise, interests-wise. How do I handle this going forward? Should I reach out in 4 weeks? Is it even possible that there's relationship potential here?

 I know a lot of the time when people say ""I'm not ready for a relationship"" what they mean is ""I'm not ready for a relationship with YOU"". I don't know if that's fully the case here. I've been in those sitiuationships before where the guy ""not ready for a relationship"" was the one to break things off and then would go on to get into a LTR weeks later. This time it was the other way around, he didn't want to end this, which is maybe part of the problem because I don't think it's helpful for him to be receiving the perks of a committed relationship without knowing if he wants one.

I understand that you need to go out the first 1-however many times until the other person feels comfortable being alone with you. That's fine. I want homebodies though.

The problem is, homebodies don't tend to go out that much, so I have no idea how to meet one.

I just want someone to snuggle with and watch Christmas movies and drink hot chocolate, but I also want to find them attractive. I have lost a lot of weight and take good care of myself, and I want someone who  also values their body. I haven't been able to find that so far, so any suggestions are welcome! Luckily, I an very extroverted and outgoing, despite being a homebody, so I don't mind meeting people in public and making the first move.","I guarantee you that a lot of the people that say they like traveling and going out, actually only travel 1-2 times a year and go out for a couple hours 1 time a month."
datingoverthirty,ypbgwy,1667882848.0,Ideas for meeting his kids,"I‚Äôve been seeing my boyfriend for three months and things are going great. Yay!! He has three kids (ages 6-11) who I haven‚Äôt met but know that I exist. And he has 50/50 custody.

I‚Äôve let him know that I want to wait until at least the new year before I meet his kids (so we have time to grow our relationship, etc.). He is very on board with that. 

As we think about this next step a thought I‚Äôd had was that I‚Äôd like for the kids to let their dad know when they‚Äôre interested in meeting me. Rather than him just telling them ‚Äúoh hey this weekend we‚Äôre going ice skating with my girlfriend‚Äù We‚Äôd also want to let them choose what we do if they want. Has anyone else let kids take the lead like this? How has it gone?

Edit: Thank you for the responses. We definitely plan on waiting at least six months (aka after the new year). And yes, I like to be thoughtful and intentional so I‚Äôm thinking about it already. Meeting his kids is a big deal!

Has anyone ever told their kids about the person their dating and then said let me know when you‚Äôd like to meet them? (Realizing that By doing it that way it could be many more months until we met)","From my experience, I think a one on one meeting at the start is too much pressure for everyone. Group settings are easier and give everyone a little extra breathing room. When you have a few successful things in a group setting, then I‚Äôd move on to an activity for you, him and the kids alone. 

I think it‚Äôs really important to know that the kids are ready. You two also need to have a big conversation on expectations, parenting styles, parenting rules, household rules, and how you envision functioning together as a team with the kids (are you helping with homework? Going to school events? Telling them to do their chores? Etc.),  prior to ever meeting them - not after!! If you find out you have completely different parenting styles and way different expectations of household management involving the kids, that could lead to some massive problems."
datingoverthirty,ypbpku,1667883613.0,Something on your mind? Share your dating Shower Thoughts and Tuesday Truths!," This is the place to share your thoughts on dating. Get as meta as you want, within the rules.","I was going to make this reply in another thread, in response to a chain about people putting things in profiles that weren't accurate representations of themselves, but figured I'd add it here instead.

I think a mistake many, many people make is trying to create profiles that maximize matches instead of maximizing their chances of matching with the right person/people.  I think forums like this often don't help that, either, as I've seen so much feedback to profile reviews where people make suggestions that just don't fit with the OP.  I've seen things like ""None of your photos show you out with friends.  You should add one.""  Meanwhile, the OP may not actually go out with or enjoy going out with others often.  ""All of your photos of are you eating or drinking.  Show some photos of you doing other things.""  And then they put in a photo of that one hike they did 4 years ago, even though that's not an accurate representation of who they really are.

Profiles should be accurate reflections of who you are and who you are trying to attract.  We need to place less emphasis on ""the numbers game"" and maximizing matches and instead on matching with someone who fits what we are looking for and vice versa.  It's still a numbers game, but we should be spending our energy on the right numbers, not the wrong ones.  And I think the people here would do better when reviewing profiles to emphasize on custom tailoring recommendations to match the type of person the OP is trying to attract.

I once matched with a woman who said she liked riding bikes.  After matching I asked and found out that what she enjoyed was that one time several years ago when she and her family rented bikes while at the beach.  That's not liking riding bikes.  That's enjoying it that one time you did it.  I (and I am sure many of us, on all sides of the ""activity"" spectrum) want to know who you are now, on a daily, weekly, monthly basis.  I want to get a grasp for what I can expect our time together to look like regularly, not on super rare occasions.

So, I guess my Shower Thought is that people should be more honest/transparent in their profiles and should place more emphasis on making them be representative of who they are and who they are trying to attract instead of targeted at casting a wide net.  And we, as people trying to ""help"" others improve things like profiles, should place more emphasis on giving feedback that helps achieve those goals."

I don‚Äôt know if I should find a introvert like myself or is someone supposed to make me want to change ?,"Just learn to clearly define what your boundaries are and clearly define what other people will get from you and how much you'll get out of your comfort zone for them. 

If you only text 3 times a week and won't respond in between those times, what effort (if any) would you put into meeting the needs of someone who wants more communication from you? Would you call, videochat, or text them more often? If so, how much is more often? You have to tell people how you're willing to meet their needs and follow through what providing what you're willing commit to. 

They also have to do the same for you. If you went out of your comfort zone 4 nights in a week going to clubs and out to dinner with them, are they willing to give you the space and quiet time that you need to recharge? If you ask them for 3 days to yourself with minimal or no contact while you get some alone time, are they going to throw a tantrum and guilt trip you?

It's all about two people clearly communicating, making specific request, making specific agreements of what they're willing to do, and putting in the effort to follow through for one another. If you're able to communicate clearly and give someone a timeline or an expectation that they can understand then that should be enough for someone who is willing and compatible enough to agree to that. 

Most people aren't going to be able to understand enough if you only tell them ""I need space"" and disappear with barely any contact for a few days. More people will understand if you tell them ""I've had a great time with you this week. I need the next three days to myself to get somethings done and have solitude for myself. I'll send you a text on Sunday to check in, and we can go see that movie on Monday"".

If you're a person that needs space you have to provide your partner security that you aren't running away and that they're not a problem."

I'm guessing that's an extreme form of a spark, but is that what y'all are talking about when you use that word?  I think I'm reasonably attractive and the women I date are reasonably attractive, but I can't say that I ever feel this singular moment with them that feels like a 'spark'... in my experience it's always been more of a ""oh, there could be something here"" (is that the spark?!) and then through the conversation we have together we get a sense of chemistry.",A spark is the thing you say is missing when you want to end things.

I‚Äôve spent my September crying (like 5-6 times a day for half hour or more) and just feeling very hopeless.

In the meantime, I happened to have started talking to this new guy, he is really nice. And we have been talking for the past 3-4 weeks, getting to know each other. He suggested a few times about meeting up as he‚Äôs keen, but I always felt a bit held back and part of me is afraid and don‚Äôt know how to do this (my confidence is pretty low atm).

datingoverthirty,yolqum,1667825024.0,Asking questions and communicating interest,"Here's a complaint I see pretty commonly: *I went on a date/was texting someone and they didn't even ask me any questions!* Not asking questions is bad because it communicates a lack of interest in the other person, and reveals that you're a self-centered person who only likes to talk about themselves.

I saw this complaint a long time ago and resolved not to be that guy. Instead, I asked my dates *a lot* of questions. I wanted to be unselfish and focused on the other person -- that's what good people do, right? So I got the feedback recently that I ask *too many* questions. And I think it's true! Looking back at older text conversations and thinking about in-person conversations I've had, I can see how I relied so heavily on asking questions that the other person ended up shouldering the burden of the conversation. This was the conversational equivalent of being a people-pleaser. Maybe I'm steering the conversational direction, but all the jokes and information and anecdotes and *risk* come from the other person, because I don't contribute much other than questions and reactions to their answers.

So I tried something new recently: see how long I can go without asking a question while still keeping the other person entertained. And it worked *fantastically*. I asked one question about halfway through a two-hour conversation. In the rest of the time, I mostly made jokes and told stories. My focus was on having a good time with the conversation *myself* and less on whether I was ""communicating interest"" by asking questions. And the other person seemed really into it! They were entertained and they were reacting well to the fact that *I* was having a good time. And I think I still communicated interest, because when they shared information about themselves I had something fun or clever to say about it, which showed I was actively listening and thinking about what they said. I think in the future I'll add in a few more questions (one every two hours is maybe on the low end), but as an experiment I think this went really well.

So this is in part a recommendation post: if you, like me, have struggled to make good conversation, maybe try asking *fewer* questions and instead try to entertain yourself and the other person. This shifts the focus from *how are they reacting to me* to *am I having a good time*, which is a far healthier conversational stance to take. But it's also a question: thinking back to the date conversations you've had that felt like they went really well, what has made you feel like your date was an unselfish conversationalist other them asking a lot of questions?

TL;DR Asking questions on dates is good, but don't be like me and do nothing but ask questions. ",I actually think that when men ask questions it makes me remember them. It‚Äôs very rare that they delve deep and I often come back from dates feeling like I asked a lot of questions but the guy just kept sharing stories about himself.

I answer about 8 questions and then he tells me he wants me to list TEN interesting facts about myself and make some of them more risque.  I told him before I did anything else, I wanted him to answer his own survey and he told me he'd answer at the end.

I (F/33) matched with a guy (M/34) on a dating app and we got to chatting. He lives in a major city and I live a little ways away in the next state over.

He said we should hang out sometime and I said sure. He wasn't really offering much of a plan so I told him when I'm available and where we can go, to which he agreed, but because of his work schedule, he said he'd keep me updated on what time was good for him. Cool. I visit the city once a week to do volunteer work, which is when I said I'd be available.

I go into the city early-ish in the morning to do my volunteer shift and naturally I have some time before my date. A few hours at least. It gets into the early evening when I still haven't heard from him on timing, so I reach out.

An hour or so later, he gets back to me. Not to tell me when he's available, but if I've ever tried this tea that is supposed to make you feel intoxicated. I said ok, what time and where. I was already at the bar where we originally agreed to meet and I needed time to get to...wherever he was going to suggest.

It was 6:15 or so at the time. He said how about 8?  I said I could do 7-7:30 latest, it's a long way home for me. He was trying to convince me to keep waiting for him until 8.

He said he was stuck at work and I said ""I totally get it if you're slammed at work, just let me know some other time when you're free. Trust me, I've been there.""

I left it at that and headed home.

Are there lessons/critiques to take away from this situation? Anything I could have done differently? Thanks

datingoverthirty,yn8fx2,1667687325.0,Why can‚Äôt I get past the 4th date?,"I‚Äôm just wondering if anyone else has experienced this or there‚Äôs something wrong with me? I‚Äôve been using OLD for the past 4 months since my separation from my ex husband over 1 year ago. I have no problem getting matches, although many of those matches don‚Äôt turn into anything (lack of conversation generally). It‚Äôs clear in my bio that I am looking for a relationship but I‚Äôm more than happy to take that very slow. I‚Äôve been on a few dates with various people; the first date always goes very well and the men are always keen to see me again. 2nd and 3rd dates usually go pretty well too but then they seem to fizzle out?! The man will slowly start to communicate less and less and not suggest another date. I pick up on energy quite well and know it‚Äôs because they‚Äôre no longer interested/ met someone else, so I don‚Äôt bother asking to see them again because I don‚Äôt want to deal with the outright rejection; I did ask one man once to see him again and he said that although I ‚Äòwas the right person‚Äô it was the wrong time for him (his wife died by suicide a couple years ago and I was the first person he‚Äôd dated since). 
For context I was previously in a 12 year relationship, I have one child. Only after coming out of it did I realise I had experienced narcissistic abuse throughout that relationship. My friends were so relieved that relationship ended as they saw what it did to me. However my ex partner moved onto someone new 3 days after we separated. As far as I‚Äôm aware it‚Äôs been fairly volatile (emotional and physical abuse during their arguments, of which i had to emotionally support my ex partner through) although they both seem settled now and I‚Äôm no longer supporting him in any way.

I‚Äôm a kind hearted person, I go out of my way to make sure people feel seen and heard. Im pretty self aware, I have a good job, own my own home, and the men I do date all tell me I‚Äôm interesting. I‚Äôm a little insecure about my looks but generally again I‚Äôm usually told I‚Äôm beautiful. So what am I doing wrong?! I do tend to traditionally wait for the man to ask to see me again because I don‚Äôt want to be pushy and I am scared of being rejected. I do tend to worry more about whether someone likes me rather than whether I like them. I can be a little ‚Äòpeople pleasy‚Äô at times. 
I‚Äôm by no means in a rush to be with someone again but I feel like there must be something wrong with me considering I‚Äôve now dated 3 guys and all 3 of them haven‚Äôt got past the 4th date! 
Has anyone else had a similar experience and did you find someone eventually?! Is this normal? 
Any advice or lived experience would be greatly appreciated ‚ò∫Ô∏è

EDIT: I do NOT expect the man to pay for these dates, all dates are either paid for by me or we split the bill. Also, I do not leave it entirely up to the man to initiate and plan the date, yes so far I have waited until the man has asked to see me again but I will always offer suggestions on what we should do (go for a walk, dinner, gym, local market etc)

EDIT 2: Thanks for all the helpful comments, basically I realise I‚Äôm still emotionally unavailable and it‚Äôs actually me that‚Äôs pulling away in a self-fulfilling prophecy style of events, thanks everyone üòÖ. Looks like I need to work on myself a little more first and come back to the dating game less concerned about whether people like me, more concerned whether I like them, and more willing to initiate seeing each other going forward!

One possibility is that if you're waiting for them to propose and plan all the dates, they're not interested in that dynamic in the long run and they're hoping you'll suggest something. 

I've never been married, but it strikes me as kinda unhealthy that you're so involved in your ex's new relationship that you're supporting him through arguments with his new partner, particularly since you say he was abusive.

datingoverthirty,yn7f03,1667685150.0,How long do you wait on a first date if the person is late?,"Simply curious how others navigate lateness and what your boundaries are :) Even curious to hear strategies you use to communicate about that if it comes up on a first date?

I recently went on a first sate with someone who was between 10-15 mins late without texting me. I had never thought about it prior, but realised whilst waiting that I was annoyed at the 10 minute mark (no longer peppy excited) and I decided I would leave at 15 mins. I'm the kind of person who will text a date if I'll be a few mins late - first impressions are important!

He arrived and maybe 10 mins later apologized for being late and shared it was because he was texting a friend (also an ex) a happy birthday message and it took longer than he thought. I didn't consider this an acceptable reason on a first date, especially when he could have texted me a heads up. I decided not to respond with ""it's ok"" and instead told him I would have left after 15 mins. He asked, ""have you been stood up before?"" And I replied, ""No, it's because I won't wait around 20 minutes for someone I don't know."" He made a grimace like ""oops"". Definitely not a good foot for a first date to start on! 

Wonder how this approach compares to others? Next time I would simply say I value my time and want a text if it happened again - bit softer of an approach.","I think 15 min, especially since he didn‚Äôt forewarn you, is plenty of time to give.

I always like checking out new neighborhoods and walking around. Anyway seemed like a good vibe match. 

Ironically he did schedule a meetup - a dinner date. Haha. (Which is totally fine - a place I wanted to try anyway). 

Personally I am usually open to meeting someone for dinner with a few small caveats. 

I am the kind of person you can kinda just drop anywhere and I can have a good conversation with virtually anyone - as long as they are not too awkward. So talking to strangers is not really an issue for me. 

Where I run into problems is when people put too many expectations on a first meet. Or of course are just boring and self centered. But if I have had a decent convo with your prior it is fine to just grab dinner. Or of course start with drinks that lead to dinner. 

Sadly as much as I want to do something interesting as a first date - I have mostly been burned, beyond museums. Museums have worked really well for me as a good first meet option, and I love them anyway. So it is a double win.

He only gets 2 days off or sometimes just one because he gets extra shifts. And of course he has personal life too so there are times when we can't talk or will talk but just very quickly.

I acknowledge that I am being insecure right now and I try as much as possible to adjust to his schedule. I am also busy but I always make time for him.

He reassures me that he wants our relationship to flourish. But I am not sure whether he is really that interested or he is just really too busy?

EDIT: I think I a more of doubting whether a nurse is really this busy.

EDIT 2: I think it was not clear that I don't expect him to reply to me midshift. I want to understand whether he is that busy as not be able to reply to me or call me after his shift.

EDIT 3: Thank you everyone for sharing your take and opinion on my issue. I think I have some clarity and would definitely talk to the guy one last time and give the relationship a little more time. If after sometime I am still not satisfied/happy with the communication, I'd choose myself by then.

You've been all helpful. Thank you!",[deleted]
datingoverthirty,ym9osl,1667594182.0,Maintaining balance with someone insanely busy?,"Looking for some advice here. 

I'm dating a woman who is starting her second year as a surgical resident at a prestigious hospital. We have great chemistry and have been on some fun dates. She is everything I'm looking for in a partner, warm, family-oriented, a little mischievous, super smart, and the tiny freckles around her eyes make me feel things. 

However, dating is 100% on her terms and her schedule. She has one day off a week, and if I'm not free that day, we're not seeing each other. We'll make plans for a date, and then a day later she'll ask to reschedule. She generally takes 24 hours to respond to a text message, and it's usually late at night. You get the idea. 

This fits the pattern of someone who just isn't that into me, and I'm not into chasing emotionally unavailable, avoidant, or disinterested people. But in this case, it's really hard to distinguish between lack of interest and genuine lack of time. Her schedule is insane, 80+ hours per week, 24-hour shifts, studying after work, and very stressful on top of that (literally life and death). I can tell that she's physically and emotionally exhausted a lot of the time.

How can I tell whether she's not interested, or whether she's giving as much as she can during a really tough time in her life? If I do want to pursue this, how to I avoid coming off way too available in order to spend time with her? 

Would appreciate any advice from others who started relationships with people in very intense careers, where the usual ""people make time for what matters"" advice might not fully apply.","The fact that she even schedules dates or responds at all is how you know. She's devoting a significant amount of her actual free time to engaging with you. This is the life of a resident. And if I'm not mistaken, she's got another 2 years after this of the same thing."

datingoverthirty,yll8y6,1667525666.0,Dating a Naval Reservist,"Is anyone currently dating or has dated a man that's in the Navy Reserves? Can you please share what has been your experience and what expectations one should have dating someone that's not on active duty?


I (F, mid 30s) met a guy (early 30s) back in Spring but he was deployed shortly after. We've been in constant communication for about 5+ months now but I'm wondering what to expect? It's okay with me right now cos I'm not on super dating mode (I've deleted / paused my apps), so getting to know him through text works. What I don't understand is the lag in response times although he has tried to explain this to me and has apologized and has told me he'll try to improve it.

Also, I can hardly call this dating cos we haven't spent much time physically together. We were supposed to meet this week since he's been back but that's now undetermined cos of his duties. He's going to be deployed again and be back next year. I'm not emotionally tied or anything (no sex = clear thinking) but I don't mind getting to know him more while he's away. I just need some real life experience from people who've been in this situation (dating a reservist).




**Edit to add an update:**

We ended up meeting this past weekend but I did let him know prior to meeting that we should just keep it friendly and continue to be chat buddies (lol) for fun if that works and / or reconnect when he gets back if there's still an interest.

But to be honest, I've concluded that we're better off as friends (without benefits) and I'm not sure if he took that message seriously but I'm definitely on friend mode.

Thanks to everyone who shared their experiences and has given me advice :)","Ok so this is unpopular but I‚Äôve had a LOT of firsthand experience (child to a reservist, dated reservist, married to active duty)

The reservist lifestyle is not demanding. They have a weekend a month that they have to drill and ~2wks a year of ‚Äúfield‚Äù or offsite training. If they‚Äôre deploying they have about a month of ramp-up and then obviously their deployment. 

If he‚Äôs giving you this line during normal times, I would question exactly what he‚Äôs doing.  Reserves is just that- you have your normal job until you‚Äôre ‚Äúcalled up‚Äù and there‚Äôs no logical reason his ‚Äúmilitary‚Äù status should cause him to not be able to answer texts. That being said, reservists generally (almost always) have an entirely separate career, so if THAT was the issue, I‚Äôd be more willing to believe it. 

Please just don‚Äôt fall into the trap of men affiliated with the military who use it for every possible excuse."

I started feeling a bit weird about their friendship and dismissed it as unnecessary jealousy, but then I noticed the twice recently he would leave the office to go to the bathroom or break room and shortly after she would leave in the same direction, and then they arrive back a while later again a few minutes apart. I‚Äôve also walked in to the break room while they were both in there a couple of times and felt like I was walking in on something.

We make an excellent team, everything always turns out spectacularly, and it's just very romantic to have a little wine and a little music and some kisses while mincing some garlic or chopping some vegetables or doing a little grilling.

datingoverthirty,yka1yh,1667407127.0,How do you use cute/adorable? A discussion for all genders,"tl;dr: Mostly curious how people use and receive the cute/adorable compliment. If you're comfortable feel free to share your gender and orientation.

I wanted to get some perspective on how people use the compliment cute/adorable. I notice that how I give it and how I perceive it when I receive it aren't the same and curious if that's true for others or if I'm creating a difficulties or double standards because of it.

I'm a cishet male and I've gotten called cute/adorable consistently in my life. I used to feel it was emasculating, or probably more accurately infantilizing since it didn't make me feel less masculine specifically, just all around not considered sexually attractive/viable. Nowadays I embrace it but there definitely is some sort of kernel of being taken less seriously as a sexual candidate remaining.

However when I compliment a woman with it, I don't mean it in an infantilizing way, and often I find someone adorable with an undercurrent of seductiveness or allure. Not that these are connected, it's just far easier for me to find someone cute and sexy than it is for me to think that I can be both cute and sexy in someone else's eyes. As I think about it I'm not sure if that's in part because of societal beauty standards holding up youth in woman as a desirable quality, a mix of some younger self-esteem issues that just coded my interpretation of cute/adorable on the receiving end as infantilizing, or something else all together.

How do y'all use it? How do y'all perceive it when you receive it?","To me, a woman, cute just means I think someone is attractive."
datingoverthirty,yk7uik,1667401971.0,Should I give her ultimatum or figure out strongly where we are at?," Dated maybe 5 months and she has always been bad texter. On Sunday she left for work trip+vacation for 3 weeks and i wished her safe travels and to let me know she lands and still no response. 

I checked the flights and there were no plane crashes so she's safe.  I know it's weird mentioning it BUT she said she had a bad dream and the dream interpretation was bad luck traveling and asked me to bring her to a temple to pray for safe travels.

We havent even been intimate yet and before she left for 3 weeks i did tell her i want us to become closer when she comes back and she gave the same ambiguous answer. Should I just give ultimatum or just ask what are we when she comes back?

datingoverthirty,yjo46c,1667343315.0,Getting past negative experiences of cohabiting,"Does anyone have experiences of getting past previous negative experiences of cohabiting? Even starting from living with my family growing up, living with others has never been a great experience for me. It would be an essay if I went into all the details but my father was very controlling growing up and through therapy I've made a lot of progress but still have issues around people pleasing/codependency. Once an adult I moved 30 minutes away from home to live with my boyfriend at the time who had bought a house. After a while we moved within the same town and bought a house together. That boyfriend was quite similar to my father it turns out and would give me the silent treatment for days over something like me forgetting to take the laundry out of the machine straight away. When we split I had to leave my cat behind as I couldn't find a rental who would take us both, I had to get a new job I didn't like to be able to afford to get my own flat and it felt like I lost everything while he kept our old house and everything in it. I then bought my own flat (in the same town I'd lived in with my ex - it was where I could afford and I liked/knew the town by that point) and let someone live with me in the early stages of the pandemic who I thought was fun and nice and who I thought I was 'helping'. It turned out he was mean and narcissistic and did nothing around the house and then blamed me for it. I basically couldn't get him out of my home and had a very traumatic time of him living with me for a lot longer than I wanted and my life was absolute misery in that time. I have enjoyed the times I've been living alone as I can live my life to my own rules rather than someone else's and I don't have to feel like I'm constantly walking on eggshells trying to live up to someone else's standards. I'm also quite introverted and enjoy the alone time.

I've learned lessons from my previous relationships and have had therapy around some of the poor relationship choices I've made. I'm now coming up to a year in a relationship with a sweet, caring man and have discussed it with my therapist every step of the way. What I'm struggling with now is that he has never lived with a romantic partner (but has had lodgers that he has been negative about in terms of cleanliness/housekeeping), and I've been absolutely burned by living with people. I'm feeling really anxious about the unknowns of living with someone new and I'm conscious that he has higher levels of cleanliness than me which triggers me in terms of my previous experiences. It feels further complicated by the fact that we both own our own places but neither are big enough for two of us and my cat and dog. He also wants to stay living in the town he's in, which is only 30 minutes away from where I live but I'm really struggling with the concept of moving again for a relationship when I've been settled in the town I'm in now for the past 8.5 years. I don't really like the town he lives in and it's further away from my work, my family and my friends and I've built a support network here around pet care etc. He wants to move to a part of town where he can be in short walking distance of his friends and the main centre of town. His town is bigger and more built up and has more to do/better transport links but my town has a lot more green space which is important to me and not to him. I live five minutes from a huge forest and I always take lunch breaks to walk there with the dog/go for runs etc. It feels like I have to make all of the compromise but when I try to talk to him about it I don't think he sees it that way. He has anxieties around losing his friends if he moves away from the town that he lives. 

So really there are two points to this post - can anyone share experiences of overcoming previous bad experiences of cohabiting and can anyone give thoughts on the idea of merging lives and making decisions about living together when you're both established in your own towns?","I just never cohabitate.

It's been 3.5 years with my man and we live separately with no plans to cohabitate. 

It's fantastic. 

We don't get in each other's way, there is no compromising on furniture set up, cooking, bed times, alone time, etc., we still get to ""date"" because we don't see each other 24/7, etc.

People think if you're in a long-term relationship that cohabitation is the default end state or expected. It's fine if you want to but it is absolutely NOT required!"

I've lost a significant amount of weight in the past 2 years (140 lbs) but I'm still a bigger girl and feel like I don't know how to smile for my face.

There's 14 total and since it's for Bumble, I'm aiming for 6.  I included a few variations of the photos I really liked, because I always see feedback on not showing your teeth in any photos.  I did include two group photos, because it felt weird having photos all solo.  On Photofeeler, the corporate headshots did really well, but I only get that done up maybe 4 times a year, so it feels a little like false advertising üòÇ

Appreciate any help!","- 1 is okay. 2 is better.  Nice angle, gives me a good feel for what you look like.  Great hair/smile.
- 3 outfit/posture isn't as good, skip.
- 4 is great. Full body pic, dressed up with a nice backdrop!  5 is same picture but worse.
- 6/7 looks like you used heavy filters.  Skip.  Photofeeler is garbage.
- 8 is ~okay~.  It's a picture of a wooded trail and you just happen to be in it.
- 9 is bad.  Never use mixed gender pictures if you're after guys.
- 10/11 is...okay.  Not a fan of the slate grey wall behind you given how colorful your other pictures are.
- 12 is amazeballs. Definitely include.
- 13 is an absolute no go.
- 14 is cute.  I like it.  include!

So I would go with 2, 4, 12 and 14 absolutely.  Lead with 2, I think it's your strongest picture.

Then include 10 and 8 as filler picturs at the end."
